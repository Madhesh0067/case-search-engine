JUDGMENT:

J U D G M E N T [Arising out of S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 2516 of 2007) D.K. JAIN, J.:

Leave granted.

2. This appeal by the three accused arises out of the order dated 5.3.2007, passed by the High Court of Delhi, dismissing the Criminal Revision Petition No. 92 of 1998 filed by them. In the said petition, a prayer was made by the appellants to quash the charge sheet and the consequential proceedings arising out of First Information Report (F.I.R) No. 155 of 1995, instituted in the court of Metropolitan Magistrate, New Delhi. Appellants No. 1, 2 and 3 are respectively the father-in-law, sister-in-law and the husband of the complainant.

3. A few facts, leading to the present proceedings and necessary to dispose of the appeal are:

The marriage between the complainant and appellant No. 3 was solemnized at New Delhi on 5.12.1993. After the marriage, the complainant was residing at her matrimonial home in Delhi. It appears that there was some matrimonial discord between the complainant and her husband, appellant No. 3, which resulted in filing of a complaint by the complainant on 17.5.1994 in the Crime against Women (CAW for short) Cell, Delhi, inter alia, alleging that she was harassed by her husband and in-laws. However, the matter was compromised on 26.6.1994 and as agreed, on 3.7.1994, the complainant joined her husband at Bijnore (U.P.), where he was posted. However, she returned back to her parental home in Delhi in mid-August 1994, as she was expecting a child.

4. On 8.11.1994, she lodged another complaint in CAW Cell. The said complaint was the foundation for registration of F.I.R. No. 155 of 1995, alleging commission of offences by the appellants under Sections 498A, 406/34 of the Indian Penal Code (I.P.C., for short). For the sake of ready reference, the same is extracted below:

I, Neetu, d/o R.P. Dixit W/o Ashutosh Misra wish to inform you that as per compromise in the Cell on 22.6.1994 with my husband I went to Bijnore on 3.7.1994 on the suggestion of my husband I came to Delhi along with my parents on 12.8.1994 for delivery. I gave birth to a son on 4.9.1994. My husband came to hospital on 5.9.1994 and requested me to come to Bijnore after 40 days. He gave me no money for expenditure. When I left Bijnore he gave me only Rs.1/- only. I did not receive any phone from him till 7th November, 1994. Then I phoned him and told him that he was required to go to Cell on 28.10.1994. He told me that he has no time to go to Cell and to bring me to Bijnore. You can come to Bijnore if you apologize to my father. Keep him happy, obey my sister and talk to your father to give you Rs.50,000/- and VCR to bring with you. Then I can come to bring you. If you come here alone with the child, we will give you good beatings.

My husband came to Rajouri Garden every Saturday  Sunday in September  October and on Dushera & Diwali. This can be verified from neighbour Hira Lal and Smt. Nirmala Sharma, President Mahilla Jagriti Samiti. Almost 2 weeks ago, Hira Lal informed me that my husband took away all my belongings with him at 4 A.M. In view of above facts, I think these three persons are conspiring. Therefore, I request that my case may be re-opened and my father- in-law, husband and sister-in-law may be punished. (emphasis supplied)

5. As noted above, on the basis of the said report, an F.I.R.

was registered on 4.4.1995, wherein date and hours of occurrence was mentioned as 5.12.1993 to 12.8.1994. Before the registration of the F.I.R., another statement of the complainant was recorded wherein she alleged misbehaviour on the part of her father-in-law, appellant No. 1. In the said statement, she stated that, my father-in-law and sister-in-law clearly warned him that till the time I will not bring Rs.50,000/- cash and V.C.R. they will not keep me. She also alleged that when she asked for return of the Stridhan, they refused to return the same with fraudulent intentions. After investigation by the CAW Cell, the charge-sheet was filed on 15.7.1995. In the charge-sheet, it has been recorded that despite issue of notice under Section 160 Cr.P.C. to the complainant and her father by the ASI, neither the complainant nor her father turned up to take back her Stridhan , which was alleged to be with the appellants. It has been noted that the complainant does not want to take back her Stridhan.

6. At the time of framing of charge, the Metropolitan Magistrate came to the conclusion that no case under Section 406 had been made out against any of the accused and further case under Section 498A was also not made out against the father-in-law and sister-in-law, being appellants No. 1 and 2. Accordingly, he discharged all the appellants for offences under Section 406 I.P.C. and appellants No. 1 and 2 for offences under Section 498A I.P.C.

7. Against the said order, the State preferred Revision Petition to the Sessions Court. Vide order dated 24.1.1998, the Additional Sessions Judge came to the conclusion that a prima facie case under Sections 498A and 406 I.P.C. was made out against all the appellants. Accordingly, he directed the trial court to proceed with the case against all the appellants under Sections 498A/406/34 I.P.C. and frame the charges accordingly.

8. Being aggrieved, the appellants filed a Criminal Revision Petition before the High Court. As noted above, the said Revision Petition was dismissed. It is this order of the High Court, which is questioned in this appeal.

9. Appellant No. 1, appearing in person, argued the case on behalf of all the appellants. It was vehemently contended that the Additional Sessions Judge as well as the High Court have failed to appreciate that the first complaint dated 8.11.1994 lodged by the complainant on the CAW Cell, which was the foundation for the registration of F.I.R. No. 155 of 1995, did not contain any allegation of demand of dowry or harassment by appellants No. 1 and 2. It was submitted that even if the allegations in the statement of the complainant dated 4.4.1995 are taken at their face value, yet the appellants cannot be connected with offences under Sections 406 or 498A I.P.C., particularly when admittedly after 3.7.1994, when she joined her husband at Bijnore, she had never lived with appellants No. 1 and 2. It is asserted that the said statement was an after thought, made after almost 8 months of the alleged occurrence.

10. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the complainant and the State supported the view taken by the High Court.

11. It is trite that at the stage of framing of charge the court is required to evaluate the material and documents on record with a view to finding out if the facts emerging therefrom, taken at their face value, disclosed the existence of all the ingredients constituting the alleged offence. At that stage, the court is not expected to go deep into the probative value of the material on record. What needs to be considered is whether there is a ground for presuming that the offence has been committed and not a ground for convicting the accused has been made out. At that stage, even strong suspicion founded on material which leads the court to form a presumptive opinion as to the existence of the factual ingredients constituting the offence alleged would justify the framing of charge against the accused in respect of the commission of that offence.

12. In State of Karnataka Vs. L. Muniswamy , a three judge Bench of this Court had observed that at the stage of framing the charge, the Court has to apply its mind to the question whether or not there is any ground for presuming the commission of the offence by the accused. As framing of charge affects a persons liberty substantially, need for proper consideration of material warranting such order was emphasized.

13. Then again in State of Maharashtra and others Vs. Som Nath Thapa and others , a three judge Bench of this Court, after noting three pairs of sections viz. (i) Sections 227 and 228 insofar as sessions trial is concerned; (ii) Sections 239 and 240 relatable to trial of warrant cases; and (iii) Sections 245 (1) and (2) qua trial of summons cases, which dealt with the question of framing of charge or discharge, stated thus:

if on the basis of materials on record, a court could come to the conclusion that commission of the offence is a probable consequence, a case for framing of charge exists. To put it differently, if the court were to think that the accused might have committed the offence it can frame the charge, though for conviction the conclusion is required to be that the accused has committed the offence. It is apparent that at the stage of framing of a charge, probative value of the materials on record cannot be gone into; the materials brought on record by the prosecution has to be accepted as true at that stage.

14. In a later decision in State of M.P. Vs. Mohanlal Soni , this Court, referring to several previous decisions held that the crystallized judicial view is that at the stage of framing charge, the court has to prima facie consider whether there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. The court is not required to appreciate evidence to conclude whether the materials produced are sufficient or not for convicting the accused.

15. Having noted the broad guidelines to be kept in view while deciding whether or not a charge against the accused is to be framed, we may advert to the facts of the present case to decide whether on the basis of the material placed before the trial court, it can reasonably be held that a case for framing charges against the appellants under Sections 498A and 406 I.P.C. exists. However, before undertaking this exercise it would be apposite to briefly note the essential ingredients of Sections 406 and 498A I.P.C.

16. According to Section 405 I.P.C., the offence of criminal breach of trust is committed when a person who is entrusted in any manner with the property or with any dominion over it, dishonestly misappropriates it or converts it to his own use, or dishonestly uses it, or disposes it of, in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which the trust is to be discharged, or of any lawful contract, express or implied, made by him touching such discharge, or wilfully suffers any other person so to do. Thus in the commission of the offence of criminal breach of trust, two distinct parts are involved.

The first consists of the creation of an obligation in relation to the property over which dominion or control is acquired by the accused. The second is a misappropriation or dealing with the property dishonestly and contrary to the terms of the obligation created. (See: The Superintendent & remembrancer of Legal Affairs, West Bengal Vs. S.K. Roy )

17. The term cruelty, which has been made punishable under Section 498A I.P.C. has been defined in the Explanation appended to the said Section, to mean: (i) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health whether mental or physical of the woman; or (ii) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand. Therefore, the consequences of cruelty, which are either likely to drive a woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury, danger to life, limb or health, whether mental or physical of the woman or the harassment of a woman, where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand are required to be established in order to bring home an offence under Section 498A I.P.C.

18. In the present case, from a plain reading of the complaint filed by the complainant on 8.11.1994, extracted above, it is clear that the facts mentioned in the complaint, taken on their face value, do not make out a prima facie case against the appellants for having dishonestly misappropriated the Stridhan of the complainant, allegedly handed over to them, thereby committing criminal breach of trust punishable under Section 406 I.P.C. It is manifestly clear from the afore- extracted complaint as also the relevant portion of the charge- sheet that there is neither any allegation of entrustment of any kind of property by the complainant to the appellants nor its misappropriation by them. Furthermore, it is also noted in the charge-sheet itself that the complainant had refused to take articles back when this offer was made to her by the Investigating Officer. Therefore, in our opinion, the very pre- requisite of entrustment of the property and its misappropriation by the appellants are lacking in the instant case. We have no hesitation in holding that the learned Additional Sessions Judge and the High Court erred in law in coming to the conclusion that a case for framing of charge under Section 406 I.P.C. was made out.

19. As regards the applicability of Section 498A I.P.C., in the complaint dated 8.11.1994 there is not even a whisper of a wilful conduct of appellants No. 1 and 2 of harassment of the complainant at their hands with a view to coercing her to meet any unlawful demand by them so as to attract the provisions of Section 498A read with Explanation thereto. The complaint refers to the talk the complainant purports to have had with her husband, appellant No. 3, who is alleged to have told her to come to Bijnore if she apologizes to his father; keeps him happy; obeys his sister and talks to her father (complainants) to give her Rs. 50,000/- and V.C.R. and brings these articles to Bijnore. We are convinced that the allegation of misbehaviour on the part of appellant Nos.1 and 2 and the demand of Rs. 50,000/- and V.C.R. by them made by the complainant in her subsequent statement, dated 4.4.1995, was an after thought and not bona fide. Section 498A I.P.C. was introduced with the avowed object to combat the menace of dowry deaths and harassment to a woman at the hands of her husband or his relatives. Nevertheless, the provision should not be used as a device to achieve oblique motives. Having carefully glanced through the complaint, the F.I.R. and the charge-sheet, we find that charge under Section 498A I.P.C. is not brought home insofar as appellant Nos. 1 and 2 are concerned.

20. Consequently, we allow the appeal partly; quash the charge framed against all the appellants under Section 406 I.P.C.; quash the charge framed against appellant Nos. 1 and 2 under Section 498A I.P.C. and dismiss the appeal of appellant No. 3 against framing of charge under Section 498A I.P.C. Needless to add that the trial court shall now proceed with the trial untrammeled by any observation made by the Additional Sessions Judge and upheld by the High Court in the impugned order or by us in this judgment."

By this petition purported to have been filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, 1950 (in short `the Constitution') prayer is to declare Section 498A of Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short `the IPC') to be unconstitutional and ultra vires in the alternative to formulate guidelines so that innocent persons are victimized by unscrupulous persons making false accusations.

Further prayer is made that whenever, any court comes to the conclusion that the allegations made regarding commission of offence under Section 498 IPC are unfounded, stringent action should be taken against person making the allegations. This according to the petitioner, would discourage persons from coming to courts with unclean hands and ulterior motives. Several instances have been highlighted to show as to how commission of offence punishable under Section 498A IPC has been made with oblige motive and with a view to harass the husband, in-laws and relatives.

According to the petitioner there is no prosecution in these cases but persecution. Reliance was also placed on a decision rendered by a learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court wherein concern was shown about the increase in number of false and frivolous allegations made. It was pointed out that accusers are more at fault than the accused. Persons try to take undue advantage of the sympathies exhibited by the courts in matters relating to alleged dowry torture.

Section 498A appears in Chapter XXA of IPC.

Substantive Sections 498A IPC and presumptive Section 113-B of the Indian Evidence Act. 1872 (in short `Evidence Act') have been inserted in the respective statutes by Criminal Law (Second Amendment) Act, 1983.

Section 498A IPC and Section 113-B of the Evidence Act include in their amplitude past events of cruelty. Period of operation of Section 113-B of the Evidence Act is seven years, presumption arises when a woman committed suicide within a period of seven years from the date of marriage.

Section 498 reads as follows:

""498A: Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty- Whoever being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.
Explanation-For the purpose of this section `cruelty' means-
(a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or
(b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.""
Section 113-B reads as follows:-

""113-B: Presumption as to dowry death-When the question is whether a person has committed the dowry death of a woman and it is shown that soon before her death such woman has been subjected by such person to cruelty or harassment for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, the Court shall presume that such person had caused the dowry death.
Explanation-For the purpose of this section `dowry death' shall have the same meaning as in Section have the same meaning as in Section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).""
Consequences of cruelty which are likely to drive a woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health, whether mental or physical of the woman is required to be established in order to bring home the application of Section 498A IPC. Cruelty has been defined in the explanation for the purpose of Section 498A. It is to be noted that Sections 304-B and 498A, IPC cannot be held to be mutually inclusive. These provisions deal with two distinct offences. It is true that cruelty is a common essential to both the Sections and that has to be proved. The explanation to Section 498A gives the meaning of `cruelty'. In Section 304- B there is no such explanation about the meaning of `cruelty'. But having regard to common background to these offences it has to be taken that the meaning of `cruelty' or `harassment' is the same as prescribed in the Explanation to Section 498A under which `cruelty' by itself amounts to an offence.

The object for which Section 498A IPC was introduced is amply reflected in the Statement of Objects and Reasons while enacting Criminal Law (Second Amendment) Act No. 46 of 1983. As clearly stated therein the increase in number of dowry deaths is a matter of serious concern. The extent of the evil has been commented upon by the Joint Committee of the Houses to examines the work of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. In some cases, cruelty of the husband and the relatives of the husband which culminate in suicide by or murder of the helpless woman concerned, which constitute only a small fraction involving such cruelty. Therefore, it was proposed to amend IPC, the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short `the Cr.P.C.') and the Evidence Act suitably to deal effectively not only with cases of dowry deaths but also cases of cruelty to married women by the husband, in laws and relatives. The avowed object is to combat the menance of dowry death and cruelty.

One other provision which is relevant to be noted is Section 306 IPC. The basic difference between the two Section i.e. Section 306 and Section 498A is that of intention. Under the latter. cruelty committed by the husband or his relations drag the women concerned to commit suicide, while under the former provision suicide is abetted and intended.

It is well settled that mere possibility of abuse of a provisions of law does not per se invalidate a legislation. It must be presumed, unless contrary is proved, that administrative and application of a particular law would be done ""not with an evil eye and unequal hand"" (see A Thangal Kunju Musaliar v. M. Venkatachalam Potti, Authorised Official and Income-Tax officer and Anr., AIR (1956) SC 246.

In Budhan Choudhry and Ors. v. State of Bihar, AIR (1955) SC 191 a contention was raised that a provision of law may not be discriminatory but it may land itself to abuse bringing about discrimination between the persons similarly situated. This court repelled the contention holding that on the possibility of abuse of a provision by the authority, the legislation may not be held arbitrary or discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.

From the decided cases in India as well as in United States of America, the principle appears to be well settled that if a statutory provision is otherwise intra-vires, constitutional and valid, mere possibility of abuse of power in a given case would not make it objectionable, ultra-vires or unconstitutional. In such cases, ""action"" and not the ""section"" may be vulnerable. If it is so, the court by upholding the provision of law, may still set aside the action; order or decision and grant appropriate relief of the person aggrieved.

In Mafatlal Industries Ltd. and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors., [1997] 5 SCC 536, a Bench of 9 Judges observed that mere possibility of abuse of a provision by those in charge of administering it cannot be a ground for holding a provision procedurally or substantively unreasonable. In Collector of Customs v. Nathella Sampathu Chetty, [1962] 3 SCR 786 this Court observed:

""The possibility of abuse of a statute otherwise valid does not impart to it any element of invalidity."" It was said in State of Rajasthan v. Union of India, [1977] 3 SCC 592 ""it must be remembered that merely because power may sometimes be abused, it is no ground for denying the existence of power. The wisdom of man has not yet been able to conceive of a Government with power sufficient to answer all its legitimate needs and at the same time incapable of mischief."" (Also see: Commissioner, H.R.E. v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Meth, [1954] 1005.
As observed in Maulavi Hussein Haji Abraham Umarji v. State of Gujarat, [2004] 6 SCC 672, Unique Butle Tube Industries (P) Ltd. v. U.P. Financial Corporation and Ors., [2003] 2 SCC 455 and Padma Sundara Rago (dead) and Ors. v. State, [2002] 3 SCC 533. while interpreting a provision, the Court only interprets the law and cannot legislate it. If a provision of Law is misused and subjected to the abuse of the process of law, it is for the legislature to amend, modify or repeal it, if deemed necessary.
The judgment of the Delhi High Court on which reliance was made was rendered in the case of Savitri Devi v. Ramesh Chand and Ors. In that case while holding that the allegations regarding commission of offence punishable under Section 498A IPC were not made out. Certain observations in general terms were made about the need for legislative changes. The complaint had moved this Court against the judgment on merits in SLP (Crl).....of 2003 entitled Savitri Devi v. Ramesh Chand and Ors. By order dated 28.11.2003 this Court observed as follows:
""Heard learned counsel for the petitioner.
Delay condoned.
We do not see any merit in the challenge made to the order of the High Court in Criminal Revision No. 462 of 2002 on the facts of the case. the special leave petition is, therefore, dismissed.
At the same time, we express our disapproval of some of the generalized views expressed in paragraphs 23 to 32 of the judgment of the High Court by the learned Single Judge. The learned Judge ought to have seen that such observations, though may be appropriate for seminars or workshops, should have been avoided being incorporated as part of a court judgment. Some of the views also touch upon Legislative measures and wisdom of legislative policy in substance, which according to the learned Judge need to be taken into account. There was no scope for considering all such matters in the case which was before the learned Judge. It is therefore, appropriate that such generalized observations or views should meticulously avoided by Courts in the judgments.""
Above being the position we find no substance in the plea that Section 498A has no legal or constitutional foundation.

The object of the provision is prevention of the dowry meance. But as has been rightly contended by the petitioner many instances have come to light where the complaints are not bonafide and have filed with obligue motive. In such cases acquittal of the accused does not in all cases wipe out the ignomy suffered during and prior to trial. Sometimes adverse media coverage adds to the misery. The question, therefore, is what remedial measures can be taken to prevent abuse of the well-intentioned provision. Merely because the provision is constitutional and intra vires, does not give a licence to unscrupulous persons to wreck personal vendetta or unleash harassment. It may, therefore, become necessary for the legislature to find out ways how the makers of frivolous complaints or allegations can be appropriately dealt with. Till then the Courts have to take care of the situation within the existing frame work. As noted the object is to strike at the roots of dowry menace. But by misuse of the provision a new legal terrorism can be unleashed. The provision is intended to be used a shield and not assassins' weapon. If cry of ""wolf"" is made too often as a prank assistance and protection may not be available when the actual ""wolf"" appears. There is no question of investigating agency and Courts casually dealing with the allegations. They cannot follow any strait jacket formula in the matters relating to dowry tortures, deaths and cruelty. It cannot be lost sight of that ultimate objective of every legal system is to arrive at truth, punish the guilty and protect the innocent. There is no scope for any pre- conceived notion or view. It is strenuously argued by the petitioner that the investigating agencies and the courts start with the presumption that the accused persons are guilty and that the complainant is speaking the truth. This is too wide available and generalized statement. Certain statutory presumption are drawn which again are reputable. It is to be noted that the role of the investigating agencies and the courts is that of watch dog and not of a bloodhound. It should be their effort to see that in innocent person is not made to suffer on account of unfounded, baseless and malicious allegations. It is equally indisputable that in many cases no direct evidence is available and the courts have to act on circumstantial evidence. While dealing with such cases, the law laid down relating to circumstantial evidence has to be kept in view.

Prayer has been made to direct investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (in short the `CBI') in certain matters where the petitioner is arrayed as an accused. We do not find any substance in this plea. If the petitioner wants to prove his innocence, he can do so in the trial, if held.

The Writ Petition is accordingly disposed of."
State Of West Bengal vs Orilal Jaiswal And Another,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/337402/,"Supreme Court of India
State Of West Bengal vs Orilal Jaiswal And Another on 25 September, 1993
1. This appeal has been preferred by the State of West Bengal against the judgment of acquittal dated May 14, 1990 passed by the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 195 of 1990. By the aforesaid judgment, the conviction and sentences against the accused, Sri Orilal Jaiswal and his mother, Smt. Gujarati Debi Jaiswal, passed by the learned Sessions Judge, 12th Bench of the City Sessions Court, Calcutta on February 29, 1990 in Sessions Trial No. 1 of 1990 was set aside by the High Court and the accused were acquitted of the conviction under Section 306 read with Section 34 I.P.C. and sentence of 5 years' rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs. 1000 in default simple imprisonment for 3 months and conviction under Section 498 read with Section 34 I.P.C. an sentence of one year rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1000 in default to suffer simple imprisonment for three months.

4. It transpires from the post mortem report that sign of death by hanging were present and according to the doctor conducting the post mortem examination the deceased had died due to hanging. The doctor also noted a few marks of abrasions on the cheek and also on the other parts of the body which according to the doctor were ante mortem in nature. On being questioned at the time of deposition the doctor had also stated that the mark of injury on the cheek of the deceased was likely to be caused by a slap and other injuries were also likely to be caused by fist and blows. The doctor, however, stated on being cross-examined that such injuries could also be caused if the deceased had dashed against a hard substance and the injury on the neck could be caused by the friction of the nylon rope.

6. Kumari Asha Jaiswal the youngest sister of the deceased was also examined as P.W. 5, and she had also stated that the mother-in- law of her deceased sister had maltreated her and used to tell her that she was the reason for the death of her father-in-law and she used to describe he as a woman of evil luck and that she should not live. She also stated that on the day when her sister had committed suicide, Orilal Jaiswal came at about 10.00 A.M. to their house and told her mother that her deceased sister and her. mother-in-law were quarrelling and Orilal Jaiswal requested her mother-in-law to go to their residence. The mother expressed her inability to go but that she would send her eldest son, Om Prakash, to the house of the accused on the next day. At about 12 noon, on the very same day they got the information that something had happened to her sister. Therefore they had been to the hospital where they got the information that the sister had died by hanging. She has stated that she had told the Police that the accused, Orilal Jaiswal, under the influence of liquor used to tell her deceased sister to take back the bridal presents because such articles were of bad quality and he also used to beat her. The elder brother of the deceased Om Prakash was also examined as a prosecution witness (P.W.6). He had also stated that his deceased sister was subjected to physical and mental cruelty by the accused. It appears that besides the elder brother of the deceased Om Prakash P.W.6, other relations of the deceased were also examined by the prosecution but since such persons were not examined at an early date it was suggested by the defence that their evidence should not be taken into consideration.

7. The learned Sessions Judge inter alia came to the finding that there was no unreasonable delay in lodging the F.I.R. by the mother of the deceased. It appears that the learned Sessions Judge has accepted the explanation of the mother of the deceased that on hearing the news of death of her daughter by committing suicide, she became unwell and was not in a position to make any statement on 19th but on the next day she made a statement to the police and such statement to the police was treated as F.I.R. The learned Sessions Judge has also noted that the brother of the deceased on the very same day made statement before the police wherein he stated that his sister had been treated cruelly by the accused persons ever since the marriage. The learned Sessions Judge has also noted that the injuries by way of abrasion noted on the person of the deceased by the doctor conducting post mortem examination was likely to be caused by slaps and fists. The learned Sessions Judge has observed that although in the cross-examination, the doctor conducting the post mortem examination had stated in answer to the suggestion given by the learned Counsel for the accused that such injuries were also possible due to impact against a hard substance and the abrasion noted on the neck of the deceased could be caused by a friction from a nylon rope which was a rough substance, such injuries were ante mortem in nature it was not likely that the said injuries would be caused on the person of the deceased by hitting against wall or other hard object after she had committed suicide. The learned Sessions Judge was of the view that there was a positive evidence from the side of the prosecution that shortly after the marriage, the deceased has been treated cruelly and mother-in-law had described her as a woman of evil luck and held her responsible for the death of her father-in-law. The mother-in-law had also abused the deceased when she had lost her child by saying that she was a woman of evil luck who had even swallowed her own baby and she should commit suicide. The learned Session Judge was of the view that there were evidences to the effect that the deceased had been subjected to physical and mental torture by the accused and she was asked to take back the bridal presents by indicating that the articles were of sub-standard quality. The learned Sessions judge has noted although the evidences about the cruelty have been given by very close relations of the deceased but simply on that score the same were no liable to be discarded. The learned Sessions Judge has also noted that under Section 113A of the Indian Evidence Act there was legal presumption that the accused had abetted the commission of suicide and such presumption has not been rebutted by any reliable evidence adduced on behalf of the accused persons. The learned Sessions Judge has also noted that the deceased had committed suicide within a year from the date of her marriage and in view of the evidence that the deceased had been subjected to cruelty and mental and physical torture the provision of Section 498A I.P.C. was also attracted in the case.

10. The learned Counsel for the appellant submits that the High Court has taken a very unreasonable view completely overlooking the clinching evidences about the complicity of both the accused for the offences charged against them. It has been contended by the learned Counsel for the appellant that on 19th April itself the elder brother of the deceased Om Parkash Jaiswal apprehending that the accused had murdered his sister reported to the police station about such offence. A written complaint was filed in the Muchipara Police Station which was acknowledged by a receipt granted by the police officer. Such complaint was simply ignored and it is stated that such report was sent to the Assistant Commissioner of Police at the Police Head Quarters at Lalbazar. It has transpired from the evidence of P.W.6 Om Parkash that later on at the request of police authorities zeroed copy of the said complaint was supplied by Om Parkash. The mother of the deceased Kamla Jaiswal P.W.2 made a statement before the police officer in Muchipara Police Station next day. Such statement was reduced to writing by the police officer and was treated as F.I.R. Om Parkash was also examined by the police on 20th April. By that time, Om Parkash came to learn that his sister was not murdered by the accused but she had ended her life by committing suicide. Hence, he made statement to the effect. It is apparent from the F.I.R. and also from the statement of Om Parkash to the Police that the husband and mother-in-law of the deceased namely both the accused had treated the deceased with cruelty almost form the very beginning of her married life and she was subjected to both physical and mental torture by various acts like abusing her as woman of evil luck and suggesting that she should better end her live by committing suicide. Such abuse was not just made once in the beginning but when there was miscarriage of first pregnancy in the hospital the accused No. 2 again abused the unfortunate daughter-in-law by calling her vile woman of evil luck (alakshmi) who even swallowed her own child and suggested that she should end her life by committing suicide. The poor daughter-in-law was humiliated by telling her that the bridal presents were of inferior quality and should be taken back. She was oppressed by making further dowry demands for Fridge, V.C.R., etc. It is the positive case made in F.I.R. and in the statement of Om Parkash to the Police that the deceased Usha became unhappy from the very beginning of her married life and she was being abused, humiliated and subjected to mental cruelty and physical assault till she had ended her life. Even shortly before she has committed suicide, there was quarrel between the deceased and the accused No. 2. The doctor conducting post mortem examination had noted there was injuries on her person which according to the doctor were anti mortem in nature. During his examination the doctor has stated that such injuries were likely to be caused by slap and fist and blow. Although in the cross examination, the doctor has stated that such injuries are also likely to be caused by dashing against hard object and the injury on the neck could be caused by a friction with rough nylon rope, the learned Session Judge has given a very cogent reason as to why the possibility of sustaining such injuries, which were anti mortem in nature, by dashing against hard object should be discarded. It is only unfortunate that the High Court has not considered such reasonings of the learned Sessions Judge in their proper perspective. The learned Counsel for the appellant has submitted that completely overlooking the fact that the brother Om Parkash made a written complaint in the police station on the date of incident itself, the High Court drew an adverse inference against the case of the prosecution on the ground that even if mother became unwell after hearing the death news of the daughter and could not make statement, father, brother or other elder member of the family ought to have lodged F.I.R. without any delay and there was no reason for lodging the F.I.R. by the mother the next day. He has submitted that the family of the deceased was under a great shock because of the tragic end of Usha within about ten months of her marriage. It is quite natural that the mother had suffered great mental shock and as such she was not in a position to make any statement to the police on the date of incident. There was nothing unnatural in her conduct. The learned Sessions Judge has rightly held that there was a very reasonable explanation for the mother making statement to the Police on the next day. It has been contended by the learned Counsel for the appellant that Usha lived only for about ten months after her marriage. During such a short period, she had been abuse and mentally and physically tortured all the time. The High Court was not at all justified in holding that there was no evidence of cruelty and abuse from the husband and evidence of abuse from the mother-in-law related to two occasions only. The High Court has ignored the positive evidence that she was subjected to physical and mental torture all throughout her wedded life and several instances of abuse and torture were mentioned. The learned Counsel for the appellant has submitted that the deceased was expected to tell to her mother and other close relations about her unfortunate experience in the house of in-laws. Necessarily, mother and close relations would be witnesses of the cruel treatment meted out to the deceased. Despite clear and unambiguous evidences about cruelty the High Court unjustly and on flimsy grounds did not accept the prosecution case and set aside the well reasoned judgment of the learned Sessions Judge. The learned Counsel for the appellant has submitted that the reasonings of the High Court in basing its finding are strained and against the clinching evidences adduced in the case. The impugned judgment has resulted in gross failure of justice and should be set aside and the conviction and sentences imposed by the learned Sessions Judge should be upheld by this Court.

11. The learned Counsel appearing for the accused Respondents, however, disputed the aforesaid contentions. It has been submitted by the learned Counsel for the Respondents that in a criminal trial, the offence charged against the accused must be proved beyond any reasonable doubt. However grave and intriguing may be the circumstances, the court should ensure that the burden of strict proof on the prosecution is not covertly substituted by surmise and conjecture. Drawing our attention to the findings of the High Court and the reasonings given therefor, the learned Counsel for the Respondents has submitted that it is unfortunate that Usha ended her life within a year of her marriage but such incident, however lamentable, should not outweigh the proper analysis of the facts established in the case. It has been submitted that against the husband, there is no evidence that he had even induced or suggested that the deceased should end her life. Allegation of physical and mental torture by the husband are only wild allegations. It has not been established by any convincing evidence by disinterested persons that the husband used to come home drunk and then abuse and assault the wife. Such incident would have been noticed in a tenanted house having common passage as the High Court has rightly pointed out. Demand for a further dowry was not indicated by the mother in F.I.R. and such case was in embellishment at a later stage so as to bring the prosecution case within the provision of Section 498A I.P.C. The High Court has rightly not accepted such false allegation by giving cogent reasons and no exception should be made to the findings of the High Court against the mother-in-law namely the accused No. 2, it has been alleged that she had addressed the deceased as woman of evil luck (alakshmi) only on two occasions and on such occasions, suggestion for committing suicide was also given to the deceased. For good reasons High Court has not accepted such case. Om Parkash (P.W.6) firstly alleged that it was case of murder but when he understood that such false allegation would be of no consequence, he made a statement to the police on the next day making various false allegations. The F.I.R. lodged by mother was a belated one and a cool and calculated manner various false allegations were introduced in F.I.R.. Such unjustified delay in lodging F.I.R with consequential cooking up a false case is not countenanced favourably by law courts. The High Court relying on decision of this Court in a case of belated F.I.R. declined to place any reliance on the F.I.R. No tenant or neighbour has deposed that the husband or mother-in-law used to abuse or assault the deceased. There is no evidence from any disinterested witnesses that at 10.00 A.M. or around that time on the date of incident there was any quarrel between the deceased and her mother-in-law or any other member of the family. In the aforesaid circumstances, there was no occasion to assume that marks of simple injuries on the person of the deceased since noted by the doctor holding post mortem examination, has been caused by slap and fist and blow particularly when the doctor has categorically stated that such injuries could be caused by hitting against hard object and on account of friction from a nylon rope. It came out from the evidence of the mother of the deceased Kamla (PW2) that she had not been staying in Calcutta but she used to come to Calcutta on occasions. In such circumstances, it was expected to have some letters written by the deceased to her parents staying outside Calcutta containing allegations of mal-treatment and acts of cruelty. The High Court has rightly noted that excepting depositions by very close relations with embellishments, there is no reliable corroborative evidence. Hence, the prosecution case was not established beyond all reasonable doubts and the accused were entitled to well recognised principle of giving benefit of doubt. The learned Counsel has, therefore, submitted that the judgment of acquittal based on cogent reasons does not warrant any interference by this Court. After giving our anxious consideration to the facts and circumstances of the case and the rival contentions made by the learned Counsel appearing for the parties, it appears to us that the judgment of acquittal passed by the High Court after setting aside the order of conviction and sentences passed by the learned Sessions Judge, City Sessions Court, Calcutta cannot be justified and the same is against the weight of the evidence adduced in the case. We have already indicated the reasonings of the High Court in some detail. We may indicate here that the High Court has summed up the following circumstances for the purpose of holding that a grave doubt has been raised against the prosecution story:

(i) there is no satisfactory explanation of delay in lodging the F.I.R.
(ii) there is no dying declaration or suicidal note.
(iii) there is no letter during the subsistence of marriage.
(iv) there is no letter addressed to the mother who used to live outside Calcutta most of the time.
(v) there is no complaint either by the father or father-in-law of the victim.
(iv) there is no evidence regarding the injuries received by the deceased or the mal-treatment.
(vii) no specific date has been given when the deceased Usha had allegedly told her mother about the demand for dowry of the mal-treatment and no specific date or time has been given for making such demand.
(viii) although the adult members of the family of the deceased consisting of four brothers, sisters and brother-in-law and father are though the residents of Calcutta, the deceased had never complained anything to them.
(ix) the neighbour or tenants have not also been examined.
12. It is, therefore, necessary to consider the correctness of such reasonings. So far as the explanation for the delay in lodging the F.I.R. is concerned, the learned Sessions Judge has held that the mother has give a satisfactory explanation as to why she made statement to the police on the day next to the date of incident in question. It transpires from the evidence of the mother that sometime between 12.00 to 1.00 P.M. the mother and the other family members got the information that something had happened to Usha for which she had been removed to the hospital. The elder brother Om Parkash immediately left for the hospital and thereafter the mother, father and other family members of the deceased rushed to the hospital where they came to learn that their daughter had died by committing suicide in the house of the in-laws. There is no difficulty to imagine that such news had caused a great mental shock to the mother particularly when the deceased had to end her life within 10 months from the date of marriage. If on getting the news of suicide being committing by the daughter, mother becomes unwell and is not in a proper mental frame to made any statement to the police, no exception can be taken to such conduct. It should be borne in mind that the elder brother of the deceased gave a written complaint to the police on the very day of the incident by indicating that there has not been any natural death of his sister and he felt that his sister has been murdered by her in-law. On the very next date, the mother made a statement to the police indicating the plight of her deceased daughter and the physical and mental torture to which she was subjected to by the accused. Such statement of the mother has been treated as an F.I.R. in the case. In the aforesaid circumstances, it cannot be held that there has been unjustified inordinate delay in lodging the F.I.R. and even if the mother had became unwell after hearing the news of the daughter's death other adult members of the family could have lodged the complaint with the Police. It appears to us that the High Court has failed to note that the elder brother of the deceased had in fact made a written complaint on the very same day to the police but the same was not treated as F.I.R. by the police and he also made a statement before the Police on the next day wherein the allegations of cruelty meted out to his sister were clearly indicated. So far as the absence of dying declaration and suicidal note is concerned, we fail to appreciate how there would be a dying declaration when it is nobody's case that Usha was alive so as to make a dying declaration. The absence of suicidal note does not appear to us an important factor in deciding the case. It is evidence in the case that the deceased had been complaining about the cruel treatment meted out to her. There are clinching evidences to support the prosecution case that Usha had been subjected to mental and physical torture and she remained unhappy in the house of in-laws, and acts of cruelty, in ordinary course, were likely to disturb the mental frame of the deceased and cause sufficient impulses to commit suicide. Coming to the question of absence of exchange of letters between Usha and the members of the parental family during the subsistence of marriage, we may indicate that barring the parents other members of the family were permanent residents of Calcutta itself and although the mother used to leave Calcutta at times, she often used to come to Calcutta and it is the positive case of the mother and also the elder brother of the deceased that on a number of occasions when Usha had come to their house in Calcutta from the house of her in-laws, she had met the mother and the other members of the family. Hence it should not be held that exchange of letters was reasonably expected.

13. Coming to the question of absence of complaint either by the father or by the father-in-law of the victim, we have failed to appreciate what was meant by the learned Judges of the High Court by the absence of complaint made by father-in-law of the victim. So far as the complaint by the father is concerned, it may be indicated that it is the evidence of the mother that she had spoken to the accused No. 2 namely the mother-in-law about the mal treatment meted out to her daughter and she also implored before the mother-in-law that the daughter should not be subjected to any abuses or humiliations. It is the prosecution case that mother-in-law abused the daughter-in-law by saying that she was a woman of evil luck and had brought misfortune to the family. It is therefore quite natural that the mother of the deceased had made complaints to her mother-in-law and had requested her not to abuse and humiliate her daughter. Hence, the question of complaint by the father was neither expected nor necessary. Coming to the finding made by the High Court that there is no evidence regarding the injuries received by Usha or the mal treatment made to her, it may be indicated that the mother, elder brother, sister and other relations of the deceased have deposed about the mal-treatment and physical assault of the deceased. The doctor conducting the post mortem has noted some injuries which were anti mortem on the person of the deceased. Where such evidences are to be accepted or not accepted or not and whether the injuries, anti mortem in nature found on the person of the deceased can be explained or not are different considerations but it will not be correct to hold that there is no evidence about mal treatment given to Usha or there is absence of any evidence of injuries sustained by her before death.

14. Coming to the finding that no specific date has been given when the deceased had allegedly told her mother about the demand of dowry and mal-treatment to the deceased it may be indicated that although exact date has not been given, there is positive evidence of the mother and the elder brother of the deceased that when after about a month of the marriage, Usha came to her parental house, she had narrated about cruelty and mental torture suffered by her in the house of the accused. She specifically complained that within a few days after her marriage the father- in-law of the accused No. 2 had died and in view of such death, she was abused and treated with cruelty by the accused No. 2 Thereafter, on other occasions also whenever she had come to the parental house, she had talked about such mal-treatment. Usha was alive only for about 10 months after marriage and it is nobody's case that the deceased complained about the mal treatment given in remote past or only on specific occasions so that exact date was required to be mentioned. Coming to the finding of the High Court that the adult member of the family of the deceased consisting of four brothers, sisters and brothers-in-law and the father were residents of Calcutta but Usha had not complained anything to them and non-complaint to such close relations was not in conformity with the human conduct, we may indicate that there is no basis for such finding and such finding is contrary to the evidences adduced in the case. We have already pointed out that the deceased had complained to the mother and other members of the family about the mal treatment and the members of the family have deposed to that effect. The prosecution case was not properly investigated by the police for which the learned Sessions Judge has rightly commented on the lapses on the part of the Investigating Officer, Sri Bimal Chandra Biswas, Sub-Inspector of Police. As the Investigating Officer failed and neglected to examine the members of the family of the deceased at an early date, the learned Sessions Judge, in fairness, has not taken into consideration the evidences of the sister and other close relations of the deceased and has mainly relied on the evidence of the mother in basing his finding. Even if it held that the deceased had complained to her mother only about cruel treatment meted out to her, we think that for a newly married woman, her misfortune in the house of in-laws was not expected to be made public and confiding to the mothers was only natural. Coming to the observation of the High Court that the neighbours or the tenants have not been examined, it appears to us that in the facts of the case, no adverse inference can be drawn for such non-examination. The abuse and insult hurled on the daughter-in-law usually are not expected to be made public so that the neighbours may have occasions to criticise the improper conduct of the accused and hold them with disrespect and contempt. The High court has expressed doubts about the genuineness of the case of physical torture and abuses made by the husband and the deceased for the absence of any independent evidence given by the neighbours and cotenants about such physical assault or the abuses hurled on the wife by the accused. We have indicated that ordinarily it is not expected that physical torture or the abuses hurled on the wife by the husband and the mother-in-law should be made in such a way as to be noticed by the tenants living in the adjoining portions of the house. It is also not the case of the prosecution that the deceased was physically assaulted so violently that the neighbours came to know about such assault. It is also not the case that abuses used to be hurled loudly so that the tenants had occasions to hear them. It was therefore not necessary to examine neighbour or tenants to prove the prosecution case. In the instant case, the evidence about physical and mental torture of the deceased has come from the mother, elder brother and other close relations. Such depositions by close relations, who may be interested in the prosecution of the accused, need not be discarded simply on the score of the absence of corroboration by independent witness. Whether the evidence of interested witness is worthy of credence is to be judged in the special facts of the case. In our view, the acts of cruelty by the accused were expected to be known by the very close relations like mother, brother, sister, etc. The evidence of the mother has been accepted by the learned Session Judge as worthy of credence and we do not think that same should be discarded, in the facts of the case.

15. We are not oblivious that in a criminal trial the degree of proof is stricter than what is required in the civil proceedings. In a criminal trial however intriguing may be facts and circumstances of the case, the charges made against the accused must be proved beyond all reasonable doubts and the requirement of proof cannot lie in the realm of surmises and conjectures. The requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt does not stand altered even after the introduction of Section 498A I.P.C. and Section 113A of Indian Evidence Act. Although, the court's conscience must be satisfied that the accused is not held guilty when there are reasonable doubts about the complicity of the accused in respect of the offences alleged, it should be borne in mind that there is no absolute standard for proof in a criminal trial and the question whether the charges made against the accused have been proved beyond all reasonable doubt must depend upon the facts and circumstances of the case and the quality of the evidences adduced in the case and the materials placed on record. Lord Denning in Eater v. Bater (1950) 2 All ER 458 at p.459 has observed that the doubt must be of a reasonable man and the standard adopted must be a standard adopted by a reasonable and just man for coming to a conclusion considering the particular subject matter.

(Emphasis supplied)

17. In the instant case, the learned Sessions Judge has come to the finding that the charges levelled against the accused have been proved by indicating cogent reasons therefor. We have already indicated that the learned Judge of the High Court have entertained a grave doubt about the correctness of the prosecution story for the circumstances indicated hereinbefore. We have analysed those circumstances and in our view the said grounds do not stand scrutiny and they are against the weight of the evidence. We may add here that the Court should be extremely careful in assessing the facts and circumstances of each case and the evidence adduced in the trial for the purpose of finding whether the cruelty meted out to the victim had in fact induced her to end the life by committing suicide. If it transpires to the court that a victim committing suicide was hypersensitive to ordinary petulance discord and differences in domestic life quite common to the society to which the victim belonged and such petulance discord and differences were not expected to induce a similarly circumstanced individual in a given society to commit suicide, the conscience of the Court should not be satisfied for basing a finding that the accused charged of abetting the offence of suicide should be found guilty. But in the facts and circumstances of the case, there is no material worthy of credence to hold that Usha was hyper-sensitive and that for other reasons and not on account of cruelty she had lost normal frame of mind and being overcome by unusual psychic imbalance, decided to end her life by committing suicide. The evidence adduced in the case has clearly established that Usha was subjected to abuses, humiliation and mental torture from the very beginning of her married life. Within a few days after the marriage when a newly married bride would reasonably expects love and affection from the in-laws, she was abused by the mother-in-law, the accused No. 2 by saying that the deceased was a woman of evil luck only because an elderly member in the family has died after her marriage. According to the evidence given by the mother of the deceased, the accused No. 2 even suggested that being a woman of evil luck (alakshmi) the deceased, should not live and end her life. When Usha conceived for the first time she had the misfortune of abortion. When the unfortunate daughter-in-law would reasonably expect sympathy and consolation from the mother-in-law, the evidence in this case is that the mother-in-law abused the deceased in the hospital by telling that she was a woman of evil luck. The evidence in the case reveals an act of extreme form of cruelty by telling the unfortunate mother that she was vile enough to swallow her own baby and she should commit suicide. There is also evidence in the case that the husband used to come home drunk and abuse her and also used to assault her on occasions. The bridal presents brought by her were branded as goods of inferior quality and she was asked to take the said articles back to her parental home. Such acts, to say the least, were very unkind and newly married woman is bound to suffer a great mental pain and humiliation. Even if we do not take into consideration the demand for further dowry gifts since the case of such demand had not been indicated in the earlier statement made by the mother which was treated as F.I.R., there is no manner of doubt that the evidence of the mother which has been accepted by the learned Sessions Judge and in our view there is no reason to discard the same, clearly establishes that the deceased had been subjected to physical and mental torture all throughout. It is only unfortunate that the accused No. 1, the husband, instead of giving her solace against the humiliation and abuses hurled by the mother-in-law, either kept silent or expressed his inability to give good counselling to the mother and to protest against act of mental torture and humiliation. On the contrary, he also treated the wife with cruelty by telling her to take the bridal gifts back to her parental home and also by physically assaulting her. Such acts, in our view, were quite likely to destroy the normal frame of mind of the deceased and to drive her to frustration and mental agony and to end her life by committing suicide. Under explanation (a) of Section 498A I.P.C., ""cruelty"" means - ""any wilful conduct which is of such nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman.""

18. In the aforesaid circumstances, the offence under Section 498A I.P.C. clearly established against both the accused. We therefore allow the appeal in part by setting aside the order of acquittal under Section 498A I.P.C. We convict both the accused namely Orilal Jaiswal and Gujarati Debi under Section 498A I.P.C. but considering the age of Accused No. 2, Gujarati Debi, we impose sentence on he to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 2 years and a fine of Rs. 2,000 in default to suffer further imprisonment for four months. The accused No. 1 Orilal Jaiswal is sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 3 years and a fine of Rs. 2,000 in default to suffer further rigorous imprisonment of four months under Section 498A I.P.C. Although there are materials on record to indicate that both the accuses were also guilty under Section 306 I.P.C. but we are inclined to give them benefit of doubt so far as the charge under Section 306 I.P.C. is concerned and they are acquitted of the said charge. The impugned judgment of the High Court stands altered to the above extent."

M.B. SHAH & K.G. BALAKRISHNAN & D.M. DHARMADHIKARI

JUDGMENT:
JUDGMENT 2002 Supp(3) SCR 339 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DHARMADHIKARI, J. ""Frailty thy name is woman"", that is how in one his plays Shakespeare described one of the female characters in his play. This description is more and more in evidence particularly in rural Indian society where married women, who are unable to muster courage to fight against cruelty and harassment meted out to them by their spouses and family members, find no escape other than ending their own life.

The deceased Krishna Kumari second daughter of PW1 was married to Yadla Srinivasa Rao (hereinafter referred to as accused No.1), on 26.6.1998. Accused No. l was employed as Branch Post Master in the village where the spouses lived jointly with the parents of accused No.1.

At the time of marriage father of the deceased, who was a teacher, gave a cash dowry of Rupees fifteen thousand and jewels worth fifteen thousand besides gift of five acres of land and a house site in the course of marriage ritual described as ""Pasupukumkuma"". It is explained that this gift of land was in the nature of 'Stridhana' given to the bride by the father for her maintenance.

After three or four months of the marriage accused No.1, husband of the deceased started demanding in from the deceased execution of a deed in his favour of the land and house site gifted to her. Refusal on the part of the deceased to meet the demand was the cause of her continuous harassment. Taking advantage of his position as the Post Master in the village, accused No.1 never delivered mail sent to the deceased by her father and her sister Nagamani. Her younger sister after passing tenth class examination had to appear for Polytechnic Entrance Test. As a part of harassment of the deceased, accused No.1 did not deliver the Entrance Card received from Kakatiya University addressed to the younger sister of the deceased which resulted in the former losing the admission to the test.

The deceased somehow was able to lay her hands on the letters addressed to her and which had been concealed by accused No. 1. On finding those letters, she handed over the same to her father. This incident led to extreme point of harassment. Accused No. l and his parents, accused Nos. 2-3, drove the deceased out from their house with stern warning to her to restore those letters. This incident of cruelty was so grave and unbearable that she committed suicide by consuming a poisonous insecticide Endo- Sulphan on 22.10.1989. PW4, who had witnessed the incident of the deceased having been driven out of the house the previous day, also saw accused No.1 taking deceased to the hospital at Madhira. PW4 informed about it to father (PW1) of the deceased who rushed to the house of the accused to find Krishna Kumari, dead. The father then lodged a First Information Report, Ex. P1 within eight hours on the same day.

All the three accused were charged in Session Case No. 157 of 1999 by the Court of Assistant Sessions judge, Nuzwid for offence of dowry death under Section 304B, IPC and in the alternative under Section 498A, IPC for cruelty and harassment of such magnitude as to drive the deceased to commit suicide. The prosecution examined the parents of the deceased of PW 1-2. PW3-4 were examined who had seen the deceased being driven out of the house and taken back only on their persuasion.

The trial court by judgment dated 19.8.1991 accepted the evidence led by the prosecution of alleged cruel treatment and harassment of the deceased which drove her to commit suicide. It, however, held that on the evidence only offence under Section 498A, IPC is made out. It acquitted them of the offence under Section 304B, IPC. The three accused on their conviction for offence under Section 498A were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for two years and a fine of Rs. 500 each. In default of payment of fine, they were sentenced to two months simple imprisonment each.

The appellants i.e. parents of the deceased filed Criminal Revision No. 564/91 in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh against the acquittal of the accused under Section 304B, IPC. The accused preferred Criminal Appeal No. 1291/99 before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh assailing their conviction and sentences.

The learned Single Judge of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh decided the revision preferred by the parents of the deceased and the appeal preferred by the accused by a common Judgment dated 24.8.1994 which is the subject matter of these two separate criminal appeals preferred by the parents of the deceased and the State of Andhra Pradesh.

The learned Single Judge of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh dismissed the Criminal Revision filed by the parents of the deceased and confirmed the verdict of the trial court that the accused are liable to conviction and sentences only under Section 498, IPC and not under Section 304B. IPC.

By the same common judgment the High Court allowed the appeal preferred by accused Nos. 2-3 (Parents of accused No.1) and acquitted them of the alleged offences.

Against the common judgment of the High Court, State of Andhra Pradesh has preferred Criminal Appeal Nos. 1458-59 of 1995 challenging the acquittal of accused Nos. 2-3 and the parents of the deceased have preferred connected Criminal Appeal No. 1457 of 1995 seeking conviction of all the accused under Section 304B of the IPC.

The High Court in its common judgment passed in Criminal Appeal and Criminal Revision before it after appreciating the evidence led against accused Nos. 2-3, has found that the allegation against them of their participation with accused No.1 in driving out the deceased from their house was for the first time made by PW-1 father of the deceased only in his deposition in the Court. At no earlier point of time either in the first information report Ex.Pl or in the statements made under Section 161 of Cr.P.C. to the police, such allegation was made against accused No.2 and accused No.3. Apart from the oral testimony of PW1 (the father of the deceased) there is no other evidence on record to prove that the two accused Nos. 2-3 joined accused No.1 in harassing or cruelly treating the deceased. On appreciation of the evidence the conclusion drawn by the High Court in favour of accused No.2 and accused No.3 is reasonable and does not justify interference by us in their acquittal. Consequently, we uphold the acquittal of accused Nos. 2-3 and dismiss the two appeals preferred by the State of Andhra Pradesh which are filed to seek their conviction.

We now take up for consideration Criminal Appeal No. 1457 of 1995, preferred by the parents of the deceased seeking conviction of accused No.1 for offence under section 304B of the Indian Penal Code. In its common Judgment after appreciating the evidence on record, the conclusion reached by the High Court that the accused No. 1 cannot be convicted under section 304B, IPC appears to be legally sound. There is no evidence against accused No. 1 that at the time of marriage there was any demand or settlement for giving dowry in cash or by way of transfer of property. The father of the deceased PW1 has not stated that cash, ornaments and the land were given at the time of marriage pursuant to any demand of dowry by the parents of the husband. He merely states that according to the custom of the community declaration was made of gift of five acres of land to the deceased as her ""Stridhana"" called in the community as pasunukumkuma. As promised and declared in the ritual at the time of marriage the land was transferred in the name of the wife. The couple lived happily thereafter. It is only 2-3 months thereafter that the husband started harassing the wife to force her to transfer the land to him. This harassment of cruel treatment to pressurize her to transfer the land cannot be said to be 'in connection with any alleged dowry demand.' For the purpose of Section 304B, IPC the legislature has borrowed the definition of 'dowry' from Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act of 1961. The relevant provisions of the Penal Code, Dowry Prohibition Act and Evidence Act are quoted hereunder:

304-B. Dowry death-(l) Where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband, for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called ""dowry death,"" and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death.
*Explanation - For the purposes of this sub-section ""dowry"" shall have the same meaning as in Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.
(2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than seven years but which may extend to imprisonment for life.""
Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 defines ""dowry"" as under :

2. Definition of ""dowry""-In this Act, ""dowry"" means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly
-
(a) by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage, or

(b) by the parents of either party to a marriage or by any other person, to either party to the marriage or to an other person.

At or before or any time after the marriage in connection with the marriage of said parties, but does not include Dower or Mahr in the case of persons to whom the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) applies.

Explanation I-For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that any presents made at the time of a marriage to either party to the marriage in the form of cash, ornaments, clothes or other articles, shall not be deemed to be dowry within the meaning of this section, unless they are made as consideration for the marriage of the said parties.

Explanation II- The expression 'valuable security' has the same meaning as in section 30 of the Indian Penal Code.

Section 113B of Evidence Act raises a presumption against the accused and reads: 113-B Presumption as to dowry death - When the question is whether a person has committed the dowry death of a woman and it is shown that soon before her death such woman had been subjected by such person to cruelty or harassment for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, the court shall presume that such a person had caused the dowry death.

Explanation - For the purpose of this section, ""dowry death"" shall have the same meaning as in Section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code.""

The legal position firmly established is that 'suicidal death' of a married woman within seven years of her marriage is covered by the expression ""death of a woman is caused..............or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances"" as used in Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code. See Satvir Singh v. State of Punjab, [2000] 8 SCC 663, The evidence which has been found acceptable by the courts below against accused No. 1 is that the cruel treatment and harassment of the deceased by him led her to commit suicide which was a death ""otherwise than under normal circumstances"". To attract the provisions of Section 304B IPC, one of the main ingredients of the offence which is required to be established is that ""soon before her death"" she was subjected to cruelty and harassment 'in connection with the demand for dowry'. There is no evidence on record to show that the land was demanded as dowry. It was given by the father to the deceased in marriage ritual as pasupukumuma. The harassment or cruelty meted out to the deceased by the husband after the marriage to force her to transfer the land in his name was 'not in connection with any demand for dowry.' One of the main ingredients of the offence of ""demand of dowry""

being absent in this case, the High Court cannot be said to have committed any error in acquitting accused No. 1 for offence under Section 304B, IPC.
We however, find that the same evidence on record which was held reliable to convict accused No. 1 for offence of 'cruelty' under section 498A, IPC, clearly makes out a case for his conviction for offence of abeting suicide under Section 306, IPC read with section 113 A of the Evidence Act. Section 498A makes cruelty by husband to wife as a punishable offence. The word ""cruelty"" is defined in the Explanation appended to the said Section. Section 498A with Explanation thereunder reads thus:
Section 498A: ""Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty-Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.
Explanation - For the purpose of this section, ""cruelty"" means-
(a) Any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman, or
(b) Harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.""
[underlining for emphasis] Clause (a) of the Explanation under Section 498A, IPC defines cruelty to mean a 'wilful conduct of the husband of such nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide.' In the instant case, the accused pressurised and harassed the deceased to part with the land received by her from her father as ""Stridhana."" As a method adopted for harassment the Postal Mail of her relatives sent to her was suppressed by the husband who was in a position to do so being a Branch Post Master in the village. When the letters were discovered by the wife and she handed them over to her father (PW1) she was driven out of the house. This cruel conduct of the husband led the wife to commit suicide. The trial court and the High Court were, therefore, perfectly justified on this evidence to hold accused No. 1 guilty of the offence of 'cruelty' under Section 498A. As a result of such cruel treatment the wife was driven to commit suicide.

Thus offence of abetment of committing suicide punishable under Section 306, IPC is clearly made out against accused No. 1 and for that purpose presumption under Section 113 A of the Evidence Act can be raised against him. Section 306, IPC reads thus:

""306. Abetment of suicide -If any person commits suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.""
113A. Presumption as to abetment of suicide by a married woman - When the question is whether the commission of suicide by a woman had been abetted by her husband or any relative of her husband and it is shown that she had committed suicide within a period of seven years from the date of her marriage and that her husband or such relative of her husband had subjected her to cruelty, the Court may presume, having regard to all the other circumstances of the case, that such suicide had been abetted by her husband or by such relative or her husband.

Explanation - For the purposes of this section, ""cruelty; shall have the same meaning as in section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.""

[emphasis applied] Both the Courts below have found the husband guilty of cruel treatment of his wife and as a result the wife committed suicide within seven years of their marriage. On such evidence the presumption which arises under Section 113A of the Evidence Act is that the husband abetted suicide. The word ""cruelty"" as mentioned in the Explanation below Section 113 A of the Evidence Act has been given the same meaning as contained in the Explanation below Section 498A IPC. On the facts found, 'the wilful' conduct of the husband in forcing the deceased to part with her land which she had received in marriage as ""stridhana"" and for that purpose concealing her postal mail was so cruel that she was driven to commit suicide. A case of conviction and sentence of accused No. 1 under Section 306, IPC has thus clearly been made out even though his acquittal for commission of the offence of 'dowry death' punishable under Section 304B, IPC is not found liable to be disturbed.

The learned counsel for the accused has argued that in the absence of a charge framed against the accused under Section 306 IPC, the accused cannot be convicted under the said Section.

From the record we find that although a charge specifically under Section 306 IPC was not framed but all facts and ingredients constituting that offence were mentioned in the Statement of Charges framed under section 498A and Section 304B of IPC. The statement of charge framed by the trial courts reads thus:

""That on or about the 22nd day of October, 1989, at your house at Tunikipadu of Gampalagudem Mandal Yedla Krishna Kumari, wife of A-l of you and daughter-in-law of A2 and A-3 among you, committed suicide by consuming poison, and that you all subjected her to such cruelty and harassment as did drive her to commit suicide, with the object of extracting Ac. 5-00 of land as dowry to A-l and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code and within the cognizance of this Court.
OR ALTERNATIVELY That, prior to the 22nd day of October, 1989; at your house at Tunikipadu, you subjected Yedla Krishna Kumari, wife of A-l among you and daughter-in- law of A-2 and A-3 among you, to such cruelty and harassment as did drive the said Krishna Kumari to commit suicide, and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code and within the cognizance of this Court.""
[emphasis applied] Mere omission or defect in framing charge does not disable the Criminal Court from convicting the accused for the offence which is found to have been proved on the evidence on record. The Code of Criminal procedure has ample provisions to meet a situation like the one before us. From the Statement of Charge framed under Section 304B and in the alternative Section 498A, IPC (as quoted above) it is clear that all facts and ingredients for framing charge for offence under Section 306, IPC existed in the case. The mere omission on the part of the trial Judge to mention of Section 306, IPC with 498A, IPC does not preclude the Court from convicting the accused for the said offence when found proved. In the alternate charge framed under Section 498A of IPC, it has been clearly mentioned that the accused subjected the deceased to such cruelty and harassment as to drive her to commit suicide. The provisions of Section 221 of Cr.P.C. take care of such a situation and safeguard the powers of the criminal court to convict an accused for an offence with which he is not charged although on facts found in evidence, he could have been charged for such offence. Section 221 of Cr. P.C. needs reproduction:-

""221. Where it is doubtful what offence has been committed-(l) If a single act or series of acts is of such a nature that it is doubtful which of several offences the facts which can be proved will constitute, the accused may be charged with having committed all or any of such offences, and any number of such charges may be tried at once; or he may be charged. In the alternative with having committed some one of the said offences.
(2) If in such a case the accused is charged with one offence, and it appears in evidence that he committed a different offence for which he might have been charged under the provisions of sub-section (12), he may be convicted of the offence which he is shown to have committed, although he was not charged with it.
The provision of sub-section (2) of Section 221 read with sub-section (1) of the said Section can be taken aid of in convicting and sentencing the accused No. 1 of offence of abetment of suicide under Section 306 of IPC along with or instead of Section 498A of IPC.

Section 215 allows criminal court to ignore any error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be stated in the charge, if the accused was not, in fact, misled by such error or omission in framing the charge and it has not occasioned a failure of justice. See Section 215 of Cr. P.C. which reads:-

""215. Effect of errors - No error in stating, either the offence or the particulars required to be stated in the charge, and no commission to state the offence or those particulars, shall be regarded any stage of the case as material, unless the accused was in fact misled by such error or omission, and it has occasioned a failure of justice.
As provided in Section 215 of Cr.P.C. commission to frame charge under Section 306 IPC has not resulted in any failure of justice. We find no necessity to remit the matter to the trial court for framing charge under Section 306 IPC and direct a retrial for that charge. The accused cannot legitimately complain of any want of opportunity to defend the charge under Section 306, IPC and a consequent failure of justice. The same facts found in evidence, which justify conviction of the appellant under Section 498A for cruel treatment of his wife, make out a case against him under Section 306 IPC of having abetted commission of suicide by the wife. The appellant was charged for an offence of higher degree causing ""dowry death"" under Section 304B which is punishable with minimum sentence of seven years rigorous imprisonment and maximum for life. Presumption under Section 113A of the Evidence Act could also be raised against him on same facts constituting offence of cruelty under Section 498A, IPC. No further opportunity of defence is required to be granted to the appellant when he had ample opportunity to meet the charge under Section 498A, IPC.
It may be mentioned that against confirmation of this conviction by the High Court under section 498A, IPC, the accused No. 1 has not preferred any special leave to appeal to this Court. The facts found proved for his conviction and sentence under Section 498A, IPC, cannot now be questioned by the accused. Our conclusion, therefore, is that same facts and evidence on which accused No. 1 was charged under Section 498A and Section 304B, the accused can be convicted and sentenced under Section 306 IPC. We find no legal or procedural impediment in doing so.
The legislature has by amending the Penal Code and Evidence Act made Penal Law more strident for dealing with and punishing offences against married women. Such strident laws would have a deterrent effect on the offenders only if they are so stringently implemented by the law courts to achieve the legislative intent. On the facts found and the offence proved to have been committed leading to suicidal death of the wife, imprisonment of two years with fine of Rs. 500 is too light a sentence. For offence under Section 306 IPC the sentence may extend to ten years. In this case the husband is found to have harassad his wife to such an extent as to drive her to commit suicide. Sentence of five years would, in our opinion, be a proper sentence for the crime with the amount of fine increased to Rs. 20,000 to be paid as compensation to the parents of the deceased. On non- payment of fine the accused No. 1 shall suffer further sentence of one year.
We, thus, allow Criminal Appeal No. 1457 of 1995 preferred by the parents of the deceased. We maintain the conviction and sentence of accused No. 1 under Section 498A, IPC. The accused No. 1 is also convicted under Section 306, IPC and sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 20,000 to be paid as compensation to the parents of the deceased. In the event of non-payment of fine, accused No. 1 shall suffer imprisonment for a further period of one year. The sentences imposed under Section 498A, IPC and under Section 306, IPC shall run concurrently.
Connected Criminal Appeal Nos. 1458-59 of 1985 preferred by the State against acquittal of accused Nos. 2 & 3 are dismissed."

1. Leave granted.

2. This appeal by grant of Special Leave, questions the legality of Judgment dated 26.02.2010, rendered by  Reportable the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Judicature, Andhra Pradesh in Criminal Petition No. 2426 of 2005 by which the prayer made by the appellant, a Police Officer, to quash the proceeding in C.C. No. 820 of 1996 initiated for commission of offences punishable under Sections 498A, 494, 495, 417 and 420 IPC, has been partly allowed by quashing proceedings insofar as offence punishable under Section 498A IPC is concerned, whereas the proceedings relating to the offences punishable under Sections 494, 495, 417 and 420 IPC are ordered to continue against the appellant.

3. The appeal arises in the following circumstances:-

The respondent no. 2 is the original complainant. According to her, the petitioner who is Sub-Inspector of Police, cheated her and her parents by stating that his first wife had died after delivering two children who are studying and staying in a hostel, even though his first wife by name Sharda is very much alive and living with him at  Reportable Avanthinagar near Erragadda and thus by making false and fraudulent representation, the appellant married with her at Yadagirigutta on 09.10.1994. The case of the respondent no. 2 is that the appellant had collected total amount of Rs.28,000/- from her father towards hand loan on the false plea that he was constructing his own house at Borabanda and the appellant further demanded a sum of Rs.20,000/-
6. In view of the above mentioned conclusions, the learned Single Judge of the High Court by the impugned Judgment  Reportable partly accepted the petition filed by the appellant under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by quashing the proceedings in C.C.No. 820 of 1996 on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, West and South, Kothapet, R.R.District, insofar as offence punishable under Section 498A IPC is concerned, whereas the prayer made by the appellant to quash the proceedings insofar as the offences punishable under Sections 494, 495, 417 and 420 IPC, are concerned, is rejected, giving rise to the instant appeal.

8. On the other hand, the learned Counsel for the respondents argued that by Code of Criminal Procedure (Andhra Pradesh Second Amendment) Act, 1992, the offences under Sections 494 and 495 have been made cognizable in the State of Andhra Pradesh, and therefore the respondent No. 2 who is aggrieved person so far as commission of offences punishable under Sections 494 and 495 IPC are concerned, was justified in lodging FIR with the police and the police after investigation, was justified in submitting charge sheet on the basis of which proceedings are pending before the learned Magistrate in respect of alleged commission of offences by the appellant under Section 494, 495, 417, 420 and 498A IPC. The contention by the learned Counsel for the respondents was that 198(1)(c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure will have to be read in the light of the amendment made in the Code by the State Legislature and therefore the learned Magistrate did not commit any error in taking cognizance of the offences on the basis of charge sheet submitted by the Investigating Officer.

9. This Court has heard the learned Counsel for the parties at length and also considered the documents forming part of the appeal.

Even otherwise, as explained earlier, she suffers several legal wrongs and/or legal injuries when second marriage is treated as a nullity by the husband arbitrarily, without recourse to the Court or where declaration sought is granted by a competent Court. The expression ""aggrieved person""

denotes an elastic and an elusive concept. It cannot be confined within the bounds of a rigid, exact and comprehensive definition. Its scope and meaning depends on diverse, variable factors such as the content and intent of the statute of which contravention is alleged, the specific circumstances of the case, the nature and extent of complainant's interest and the nature and the extent of the prejudice or injury suffered by the complainant. Section 494 does not restrict right of filing complaint to the first wife and  Reportable there is no reason to read the said Section in a restricted manner as is suggested by the learned Counsel for the appellant. Section 494 does not say that the complaint for commission of offence under the said section can be filed only by wife living and not by the woman with whom subsequent marriage takes place during the life time of the wife living and which marriage is void by reason of its taking place during the life of such wife. The complaint can also be filed by the person with whom second marriage takes place which is void by reason of its taking place during the life of first wife.
A bare reading of the complaint together with statutory provisions makes it abundantly clear that the appellant having a wife living, married with the respondent no. 2 herein by concealing from her the fact of former marriage and therefore her complaint against the appellant for commission of offence punishable under Section 494 and 495 IPC is, maintainable and cannot be quashed on this ground.
Reportable To hold that a woman with whom second marriage is performed is not entitled to maintain a complaint under Section 494 IPC though she suffers legal injuries would be height of perversity.
For all these reasons, it is held that the woman with whom second marriage is contracted by suppressing the fact of former marriage would be entitled to maintain complaint against her husband under Sections 494 and 495 IPC.

12. The argument that the learned Magistrate could not have taken cognizance of offence punishable under Sections 494 and 495 IPC on the basis of the police report i.e. charge sheet, as those offences are non- cognizable and therefore, the relief claimed in the petition filed before the High Court under Section 482 of the Code should have been granted is devoid of merits.

Here in this case in the charge sheet it is mentioned that the appellant has also committed offence punishable under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code which is cognizable and therefore this is a case which relates to two or more offences of which at least one is cognizable and therefore the case must be deemed to be cognizable case notwithstanding that the other offences are non- cognizable.

This is not a case in which the FIR is exclusively filed for commission of offences under Sections 494 and 495 IPC.

In view of firm and clear law laid down on the subject, this Court is of the confirmed view that the High Court was not justified at all in quashing the proceedings initiated against the appellant under Section 498A of the Code on the ground that the respondent no. 2 was not wife within the meaning of Section 498A of the IPC and was not entitled to maintain complaint under the said provision. The question therefore which arises for consideration of the Court is whether the said finding recorded by the High Court can and should be set aside in the present appeal which is filed by  Reportable the husband. It was argued by the learned Counsel for the appellant that quashing of proceedings with reference to offence punishable under Section 498A of Indian Penal Code is neither challenged by the State Government nor by the original complainant before this Court and the same having attained finality, the same cannot be disturbed in an appeal filed by the husband appellant in which grievance is made regarding non-grant of relief in full by the High Court.

2 for commission of offence punishable under Section 498A  Reportable of IPC should be quashed or not. The High Court has completely misdirected itself in quashing the proceedings for the offence punishable under Section 498A of IPC. There is no manner of doubt that the finding recorded by the High Court that the respondent no. 2 is not the wife within the meaning of Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code runs contrary to law declared by this Court in case of Reema Aggarwal (Supra). There may be several reasons due to which the State might not have challenged that part of the Judgment of the learned Single Judge quashing the complaint filed by the respondent no. 2 under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. So also because of several reasons such as want of funds, distance, non-availability of legal advice, etc. the original complainant might not have approached this Court to challenge that part of the judgment of the learned Single Judge which is quite contrary to the law declared by this Court. However, this Court while entertaining an appeal by grant of special leave has power to mould relief in favour of the respondents notwithstanding the fact that no appeal is filed by any of the respondents  Reportable challenging that part of the order which is against them. To notice an obvious error of law committed by the High Court and thereafter not to do anything in the matter would be travesty of justice. This Court while disposing of an appeal arising out of grant of special leave can make any order which justice demands and one who has obtained illegal order would not be justified in contending before this Court that in absence of any appeal against illegal order passed by the High Court the relief should not be appropriately moulded by the Court or that the finding recorded should not be upset by this Court.

20. Therefore, that part of the impugned judgment by which the complaint filed by the respondent no. 2 under Section 498A of the Indian Penal code is quashed by the High Court will have to be set aside while disposing the appeal filed by the appellant.

21. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal filed by the appellant fails and therefore the same is hereby dismissed.

The impugned Judgment quashing the complaint filed by the respondent no. 2 for alleged commission of offence by the  Reportable appellant under Section 498A IPC, is hereby set aside and the complaint lodged by the respondent no. 2 under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code as well as charge sheet submitted by the Investigating Officer for the same shall stand restored/revived. Subject to above mentioned direction the appeal stands disposed of.

U.Suvetha vs State By Insp.Of Police & Anr on 6 May, 2009
S.B. SINHA, J.


1. Leave granted.


2. Whether the term ""relative of husband of a woman"" within the meaning of Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code should be given an extended meaning is the question involved herein.



""Even though properly advised my husband he has not cut the illegal relationship with the said Swetha. If I talk about her, my husband beat me and tortured me. My mother-in-law also abetting him. If my husband received the salary, he gave the same with his aunt Thangam, then whenever required, at that time he get the money from her for his expenses. Even though my mother-in-law has known very well about the illegal intimacy of the husband with Swetha wantonly given married me with him. The address of the said lover Swetha is D/o. Venka Takrishnan, No.167, Majestic Colony Valasaravakkam, Alwarthirunagar, Chennai-50, for not paying the money and jewellery my husband of my mother-in-law compelled me to get divorce and tortured me. I am tolerating all these hardships. In the deepavali of the year 2006 my husband told me that he is going to his native and left me with my parents' house.
 Hence my father send/issued a legal notice to my husband and my mother-in-law on 13.11.2006, then even though conciliation talks made, but the said conciliation failed on 12.1.07. My husband filed petition for divorce. Hence I request you to take immediate action on my complaint and get back my dress and my TV Scooty NoTN05 C 4971. My husband and my mother-in-law concealed the true facts and married me and spoiled my life. Hence, I also request you to take action against them and file a case against them and get punished them in accordance with law. My husband and mother-in-law tortured and ill- treated me by demanding dowry. They have scolded me with untoward and untolerable words and beat me so many times and treated me very badly. Hence, I pray to take action in accordance with law against them and punish them. My husband's aunt Tmt. Thangam, her son-in-law Utha, and his concubine Swetha all are inducing my husband and my mother-in-law to ill treat me and tortured me. Hence I request you to take action against those persons and punish them in accordance in law after filing a case.""


The core question which arises for consideration is as to whether the `girl friend' would be a `relative of husband of a woman' in terms of Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.


8. The High Court opined that the word `paramour' and the `concubine' stand on the same footing. In arriving at the said opinion, it agreed with the decision of a Division Bench of Andhra Pradesh High in Vungarala Yedukondalu v. State of Andhra Pradesh, [ 1988 CRI. L.j. 1538 ] and differed with the decision of the Bombay High Court, to opine :-

""The term ""relative"" has not been defined in Indian Penal Code and in the absence of any such definition, we have to go by the precedents. Assuming that the allegations made against the  petitioner viz., that she is the concubine of A1 is true, then, it is to be held that there is a living relationship between the petitioner and A1 in the case and there are specific allegations to the fact that only at the instigation of the revision petitioner, A1 is harassing the second respondent and as such this Court is of the considered view that a charge under Section 498-A of IPC among other offence has also been rightly framed against the revision petitioner.""
9. Ingredients of 498A of the Indian Penal Code are :-

      a).    The woman must be married

      b)     She must be subjected to cruelty or harassment;
             and

      c)     Such cruelty or harassment must have been shown
either by husband of the woman or by the relative of her husband.""

It is not the case of the first informant that the appellant had any role to play with regard to demand of dowry.



Random House Webster's Concise College Dictionary defines `relative' at page 691 to mean :-

""Relative n. 1. a person who is connected with another or others by blood or marriage.2. something having, or standing in, some relation to something else. 3. something dependent upon external conditions for its specific nature, size, etc.  (opposed to absolute). 4. a relative pronoun, adjective, or adverb. - adj. 5. considered in relation to something else; comparative: the relative merits of gas and electric heating. 6. existing or having its specific nature only by relation to something else; not absolute or independent: Happiness is relative.
7. having relation or connection. 8. having reference : relevant; pertinent (usually fol. by to):
two facts relative to the case. 9. correspondent; proportionate: 10. depending for significance upon something else: ""Better"" is a relative term. 11. of or designating a word that introduces a subordinate clause and refers to an expressed or implied element of the principal clause: the relative pronoun who in ""That was the woman who called."" 12. (of a musical key) having the same key signature as another key: a relative minor.""

This Court in T. Ashok Pai v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Bangalore, [ 2007 (8) SCALE 354 ] held as under :-

""19. It is now a well-settled principle of law that the more is the stringent law, more strict construction thereof would be necessary. Even when the burden is required to be discharged by an assessee, it would not be as heavy as the prosecution. [See P.N. Krishna Lal and Ors. v. Govt. of Kerala and Anr. 1995 Supp (2) SCC 187].""
[See also Noor Aga v. State of Punjab, [ 2008 (9) SCALE 681].

14. A Three Judge Bench of this Court, however, in Shivcharan Lal Verma and another v. State of M.P., [2002 (2) Crimes 177 SC = JT (2002) 2 SC 641] while interpreting Sedction 498A of the Indian Penal Code, in a case where the prosecution alleged that during the life of the first wife- Kalindi, appellant therein married for the second time, Mohini, but after marriage both Kalindi and Shiv Charan tortured Mohini as a result thereof, she ultimately committed suicide by burning herself, opined :-.

""..One, whether the prosecution under Section 498A can at all be attracted since the marriage with Mohini itself was null and void, the same having been performed during the lifetime of Kalindi. Second, whether the conviction under Section 306 could at all be sustained in the absence of any positive material to hold that Mohini committed suicide because of any positive act on the part of either Shiv Charan or Kalindi. There may be considerable force in the argument of Mr. Khanduja, learned counsel for the appellant so far as conviction under Section 498A is concerned, inasmuch as the alleged marriage with Mohini during the subsistence of valid marriage with Kalindi is null and void. We, therefore, set aside the conviction and sentence under Section 498A of the IPC.""
15. A Two Judge Bench of this Court, however, in Reema Aggarwal v. Anupam, [ (2004) 3 SCC 199 ], while construing the expression 'husband' opined that the word should not be given a restricted meaning to include those, who had married for the second time strictly in accordance with law, stating :-


""...If such restricted meaning is given, it would not further the legislative intent. On the contrary, it would be against the concern shown by the legislature for avoiding harassment to a woman over demand of money in relation to marriages. The first exception to Section 494 has also some relevance. According to it, the offence of bigamy will not apply to ""any person whose marriage with such husband or wife has been declared void by a court of competent jurisdiction"". It would be appropriate to construe the expression ""husband""

16. It is not necessary to go into the controversy as to whether Reena Agarwal (supra) was correctly decided or not as we are not faced with such a situation here. We would assume that the term `husband' would bring within its fold a person who is said to have contracted a marriage with another woman and subjected her to cruelty.


17. Herein, as noticed hereinbefore, relationship of the appellant with the husband of the first informant, is said to have been existing from before the marriage. Indisputably they lived separately. For all intent and purport the husband was also living at a separate place. The purported torture is said to have been inflicted by the husband upon the first informant either at her in- law's place or at her parents' place. There is no allegation that appellant had any role to play in that regard.

18. By no stretch of imagination a girl friend or even a concubine in an etymological sense would be a `relative'. The word `relative' brings within its purview a status. Such a status must be conferred either by blood or marriage or adoption. If no marriage has taken place, the question of one being relative of another would not arise.


19. We may notice that the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Rajeti Laxmi v. State of Andhra Pradesh, [ 1 (2007) DMC 797 ], held as under :-

""4. The entire reading of the charge-sheet and the statements of L.Ws. 1 to 7, goes to show that it is nobody's case of the accused or the prosecution that A-6 is the relative of husband of L.W. 1. She  is only concubine of A-1 and having illicit intimacy with him. Therefore, in the absence of any averment in the charge-sheet or any statement that she is a relative of A1, I am of the opinion that the offence under Section 498A, IPC do not attract to A-6. Even as per the dictionary meaning ""relative"" means a person connected by blood or marriage or `a species' related to another by common origin"". Simply because A-6 is having illicit intimacy with A-1, it cannot be said that she is a relative of A-1. Accordingly, the Criminal Petition is allowed quashing the proceedings in C.C. No.233 of 2004 for the offence under Section 498-A, IPC, against the petitioner,A-6. Insofar as the other offences are concerned, it may go on.""
A learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court, Bench at Aurangabad, in Swapnaja v. State of Maharashtra and another, [ Criminal Application No.388 of 2008 decided on 21.4.2008 ], opined :-

""....Even assuming that due to her extramarital relation with husband of the respondent No.2, she is being ill-treated or subjected to harassment by her husband and his relatives, then also it is difficult to say that the applicant is accountable to answer the charge for offence punishable under Section 498-A of the I.P.C. For, she is not related to husband of the respondent No.2 nor can be regarded as the person, who can fall within explanation (a) or (b) of Section 498-A of the I.P.C.""
To the similar effect is the law laid down by the same High Court in Ranjana Gopalrao Thorat v. State of Maharasthra, [ 2007 CRI.L.J. 3866 ]. A learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court, however, preferred to follow Shivcharan Lal Verma (supra) in preference to Reena Aggarwal (supra) to hold that precedentially the former is binding on the High Court, stating :-


"" Therefore the decision in Shivcharan Lal Verma (supra) will clearly take precedence over the decision in Reema Aggarwal (supra). That being the case, the arguments advanced by the learned Counsel for the petitioners would have to be accepted that the provisions of Section 498-A IPC would not be attracted inasmuch as the marriage between Mohit Gupta and Shalini was null and void and Mohit Gupta could not be construed as a `husband' for the purposes of Section 498-A IPC. Clearly, therefore, the charge under Section 498-A IPC cannot be framed and the Metropolitan Magistrate had correctly declined to frame any charges under Section 498-A IPC.""
Similar view was taken by a learned Single Judge of the same High Court in Capt. Rajinder Tiwari v. The State (NCT of Delhi), [ Criminal Revision P. No. 872 of 2006 decided on 14.12.2006 ], stating :

""9. As already indicated above, insofar as the charge under Section 498A IPC is concerned, that issue is no longer open for debate. The same has been decided by this Court in the case of Mohit Gupta & others (supra) applying the ratio of the Supreme Court decision in the case of Shivcharan Lal Verma (supra). Since the marriage between  Rajidner and Meenakshi was a nullity in view of the pendency of Rajinder's divorce proceedings qua his first wife, the offence under Section 498A, which is specific to ""husband"", would not be maintainable, therefore, the impugned order needs to be corrected on this ground also.""
20. We are, however, not oblivious of the fact that a learned Single Judge of the Kerala High Court in John Idiculla v. State of Kerala, [ 2005 M.L.J. (Crl.) 841 ] relying on Reema Agarwal (supra) gave a wider meaning to the word ""second wife"" to hold :-


""25. The test under Section 498A IPC is whether in the facts of each case, it is probable that a woman is treated by friends, relatives, husband or society as a ""wife"" or as a mere ""mistress"". If from the pleadings and evidence the Court finds that the woman concerned is regarded as wife and not as a mere mistress, she can be considered to be a 'wife' and consequently as 'the relative of the husband' for purpose of Section 498A IPC. Proof of a legal marriage in the rigid sense as required under civil law is unnecessary for establishing an offence under Section 498A IPC. The expression ""marriage"" or ""relative"" can be given only a diluted meaning which a common man or society may attribute to those concepts in the common parlance, for the purpose of Section 498A IPC. A second wife who is treated as wife by the husband, relatives, friends or society can be considered to be 'the relative of the husband' for the purpose of Section 498A of IPC. If she inflicts cruelty on the legally-wedded wife of the husband, an offence under Section 498A IPC will not lie against her.""
21. Applying the principles laid down in various decisions referred to above, we have no doubt, in our mind, that the appellant is not a relative of the husband of the first informant.


22. For the reasons aforementioned, the impugned judgment cannot be sustained. It is set aside accordingly. The appeal is allowed.

Raj Kumar Khanna vs The State (Nct Of Delhi) And Ors,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1045131/,"Delhi High Court
Raj Kumar Khanna vs The State (Nct Of Delhi) And Ors. on 15 October, 2001
1. Mr. Raj Kumar Khanna, a practicing lawyer of this Court has sought for the quashing of the FIR No. 146/99 registered at Police Station Naraina, under Section 498A/406/34 Indian Penal Code (In short IPC) against him and his family members at the instance of his daughter-in-law Ms. Inderjit Kaur Sidhu, respondent No. 5 another practicing lawyer of this Court.

2. Son of the petitioner Manoj Kumar is also a practicing lawyer of this Court. He got married to Inderjit Kaur Sidhu on 22nd September, 1996 according to Hindu rites at Gurudwara in Sarojini Nagar, New Delhi. After the marriage the newly married couple started living with the petitioner in his apartment. Relations between newly married couple became strained. According to petitioner, respondent No. 5 did not subscribe to the view points and values of petitioner and his family. She was adamant and not interested to live with her husband in the family of her husband. She left the matrimonial home on 5th September, 1997 informing her husband that she would never come back. Son of the petitioner filed a petition for divorce. Along with this petition Manoj also filed an application under Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act attaching list of articles left by respondent No. 5. The said petition was listed on 26th May, 1999. Summon on that petition was ordered to be issued. It is further averred that respondent No. 5 on becoming aware of Manoj Kumar's filing of a petition of divorce, fabricated a complaint not only against her husband, but implicated all family members of the petitioner with oblique motives and as a retaliation to the divorce proceedings initiated by Manoj Kumar. Respondent No. 5 filed a well thought out complaint so that all members of petitioner's family could be implicated. The complaint dated 9th July, 1999 was lodged with the Deputy Commissioner of Police, South-West District, Vasant Vihar i.e. respondent No. 2. The said complaint was registered on 9th July, 1999 itself under Section 498A/406/34 IPC at Police Station Naraina. After the registration of the case, SI Nirmal Sharma, respondent No. 4 along with respondent No. 5 raided the apartment of the petitioner at 9.30 A.M. on 12th July, 1999. At that time the petitioner was about to leave his house in order to attend his cases in the High Court. Entire house of the petitioner was ransacked, every article stored in trunks and/or in wooden diwans and almirahs were pulled out. Each and every drawer and filing rack of his office was ransacked. Ms. Inderjit Kaur removed the sarees and gold jewellery of petitioner's wife claiming those to be hers. Police accordingly seized even the articles belonging to petitioner's wife. Inderjit Kaur not only got seized sarees and gold ornaments but removed letters, greeting cards which she had written to her husband during the period she stayed away from her husband. Those letters, greeting cards when produce would show that she was all complements for petitioner and his wife. Police in connivance with Inderjit Kaur took away photographs and a diary that contained notes of the outings made and places visited by Manoj Kumar and respondent No. 5. The object of conducting the raid was to remove documentary evidence from the house of the petitioner which would have otherwise proved their innocence and falsity of the allegations made by respondent No. 5 in her complaint dated 9th July, 1999. Protest was raised by the petitioner and his wife than the articles like letters, photos, diary and greeting cards could not form ""Stridhan"" hence these could not be seized. But police in particular respondent No. 4 in connivance with respondent No. 5 brushed aside the protests of the petitioner. Illegally and forcibly police permitted respondent No. 5 remove those letters, greeting cards, diary and photographs. Petitioner insisted signing the seizure memo. Respondent No. 4 forced by petitioner allowed him to counter sign the letters, greeting cards, photos and the diary. Seizure memo was prepared at the spot. Thereafter the petitioner and his wife were arrested. However, bail was granted to them subsequently. While filing the charge-sheet, the said letters, greeting cards, photos and diary have not been filed as a part of the documents. This the respondents did it deliberately. It amounts to tampering with the evidence. The police authorities acted on extraneous consideration and in a hurry without verifying the facts in raiding his house. This act of the respondents has caused irreparable loss to the reputation of the petitioner. Allegations made in the FIR do not implicate the petitioner nor any allegations levelled against petitioner fall under the provision of Section 498A or under Section 406 IPC. Therefore, seeks quashing of FIR against him as well as the proceedings emanating there from.

4. Mr. D.C. Mathur, Senior Advocate, appearing for the petitioner has sought quashing of FIR on the following grounds:- (1) that the procedure adopted by SI Nirmal Sharma was extraordinary. It is contrary to the well regulated procedure followed by the police in other similarly situated case; (2) that the allegations levelled against the petitioner do not make out any case either under Section 406 IPC or under Section 498-A IPC; (3) The complaint dated 9th July, 1999 was lodged at the instance of respondent No. 5 after two years of her leaving the matrimonial home. It is a meticulously executed legally drafted document and well thought out comprehensive complaint. There was no reason for the police to record her alleged supplementary statement purported to be recorded on 10th July, 1999. This smacks of malafide on the part of the investigating officer who in connivance with connivance with respondent No. 5 falsely implicated each and every member of petitioner's family.

5. Challenging the procedure adopted by the police in rushing through action on the complaint, Mr. Mathur contended that it was contrary to the directions issued by Commissioner of Police. Complaint was lodged by respondent No. 5 with the Deputy Commissioner of Police (South-West District) Delhi on 9th July, 1999 and at a super speed the FIR bearing No. 146/99 was ordered to be registered at Police Station Naraina against the petitioner and his family members. The speed at which the FIR was got registered shows malafide on the part of police officials. In the normal course the complaint ought to have been endorsed by SHO Police Station Naraina and then forwarded it to Crime Against Women Cell. Since there was a connivance between respondent No. 2 i.e. Dy. Commissioner of Police (South West District) and Ms. Inderjit Kaur Sidhu (respondent No. 5) the case was got registered on the basis of covering letter sent by Asstt. Commissioner of Police (Crime) with direction to register the case and, thereafter transferred the investigation to the Crime Against Women Cell, Vasant Vihar, New Delhi. This action is contrary to the general practice and procedure followed by the Crime Against Women Cell. In this regard Mr. Mathur drew our attention to the rejoinder affidavit filed by the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Police Head Quarters-II) in Crl.W.No. 127/1992 to show that the Crime Against Women Cell was created by the Commissioner of Police to receive such complaints and then make efforts to ascertain facts and try for reconciliation. Mr. Dinesh Mathur in particular referred to paras 4 & 5 of the said affidavit in support. Those paras are reproduced as under:-

4. Unfortunately, during the last decade there has been sharp increase in the cases of bride burning, homicide, suicide on account of cruel treatment meted out to the brides at the hands of husbands, in-laws or on account of dowry demands and that necessitated the establishment of Special Cell to enquire into and investigate such like incidents and thus a cell known as 'CRIME AGAINST WOMEN CELL"" was established by means of S.O. No. 281/1989 (Copy of which is annexed hereto as Annexure-'A').
5. The proceedings taken up by the Crime Against Women Cell are mainly directed to bring about a reconciliation between the strained spouses. It is always kept in mind that the petitioner-wife should not drag the husband-respondent straight to the Court, lest the relations between the couple become more strained. On the failure of reconciliation, resort to the provisions of law is taken to. It will not be out of place to mention that even the matrimonial courts, during divorce proceedings, try to bring about reconciliation between the parties. If a respondent chooses not to take part in the proceedings before the Crime Against Women Cell, well it is his sweet will. No action is taken for non-appearance. There is no compulsion for the respondent to take part in the proceedings. The proceedings are in the nature of enquiry to find out the truth as to the allegations made in the complaint before registering a case. For example, it also becomes necessary to ascertain the factum of marriage even, and also the allegations of cruelty and Stridhan.

6. Mr. Mathur then contended that another affidavit was filed by the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Hqrs.-II) in Crl.W.No. 663/1995 wherein he has stated as under:-

""The proceedings by the Crime Against Women Cell are in the nature of enquiry to find out the truth as to the allegations made in the complaint before registering a case. For example it becomes necessary to ascertain the factum of marriage, even and also the allegations of cruelty and Stridhan.""
7. In para 16 of this affidavit Mr. Srivastava, Dy. Commissioner of Police (Hqrs.-II) stated that the enquiry by the said CAW Cell is in the nature of primary enquiry with the sole object to make the marriage success and in case the matter is not reconciled between the parties the complaint is proceeded in accordance with law. In case the allegations made in the complaint are not found to be true the complaint is dropped/closed. He drew our attention to a press cutting appearing in the Times of India (Supplement) dated 21.9.1999. It as relied by the State and filed with its rejoinder affidavit to show that Crime Against Women Cell has never registered a case without a proper enquiry being conducted. It was also clarified that if a complaint is found to be baseless, officials of these Cells do not register a case. This was so stated by the Deputy Commissioner of Police (South West District). But police contrary to its own affidavit as referred to above acted just in the reverse. It did not bother to verify the facts nor bothered to call the parties for reconciliation. Instead police in a hurry registered the case in super speed. It is unimaginable that the Asstt. Commissioner of Public could have verified the complaint as per the requirements as spell out in the affidavit of Dy. Commissioner of Police (Hqrs.). Nothing has been placed on record to show what was the grave urgency in registering the case without holding preliminary inquiry particularly when the complainant herself conveniently slept over the matter for almost two years. This shows malafide on the part of the police who in connivance with respondent No. 5 wanted to harass the petitioner and his family and also wanted to destroy the evidence against her. Registration of the case was for extraneous considerations done under the influence used by respondent No. 5. Police Headquarter framed the procedure to be followed by the C.A.W. Cell with the intention of preventing abuse of the process of law. But in this case police committed abuse of the process established by its Commissioner. No attempt was made to resolve the difference between Manoj Kumar and respondent No. 5 nor efforts were made to bring about amicable settlement for which purpose Crime Against Women Cell was created. This cell is meant to safeguard the marriage and not to ruin it by registering case immediately on the asking of the complainant. Once an FIR is registered it becomes difficult to solve matrimonial tangles and things reaches such a pas that it cannot be restored back. In this case because of the ulterior motive and due to malafide and under pressure exercised by respondent No. 5, the FIR was registered in a shortest possible time and with haste police raided the house of the petitioner and arrested him and his wife in order to seek vendetta against them.

9. Mr. Lekhi countering these arguments urged that expediting the action by itself is no ground to quash the FIR. We agree with Mr. Lekhi that on this ground itself FIR cannot be quashed but at the same time we cannot ignore the haste with which police acted violating its own guidelines.

11. Mr. Mathur contended that guidelines Nos. 5 and 7 are material for the purpose of quashing the FIR in question. The guidelines No. 5 stipulate quashing of the FIR where allegations are so absurd and inherently improbable that no prudent person can reach a just conclusion that there are sufficient grounds for proceeding against the accused. Relying on this guideline, Mr. Mathur contended that the petitioner who is a practicing lawyer aged about 65 years has been attending the court regularly and so is the case of respondent No. 5, if any cruelty had been inflicted on her she could not have attended the court every day moreover this fact would have been known in the Bar to every one. But nothing of this sort happened. Allegations that petitioner gave beating to respondent No. 5 with stick and taunted her are so absurd and inherently improbable that this Court must necessarily reject the same. Guideline No. 7 as reproduced above indicates that where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with malafide and/or where the proceedings is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge, such an FIR must be quashed. On facts of this case, allegations levelled by complainant smacks a malafide and personal vendetta from start to finish. The complainant left the matrimonial home on 5.9.1997. As per her own showing she continued to keep channel of communication open with her husband even after leaving the matrimonial home. But when the petitioner's son filed divorce petition on 26th May, 1999 as a retaliation she lodged the present complaint in order to wreck vengeance. In this view of the matter the FIR lodged by her requires quashing. In the case of Madhavrao Jiwaji Rao Scindia and Anr., etc. v. Sambhajirao Chandrojirao Angre and Ors., etc. Apex Court observed that ""special features of a case"" must also be taken into account at the time of quashing proceedings. Reliance was also placed on following decisions: K. Rama Krishna and Ors. v. State of Bihar and Anr. ; Ashim K. Roy v. Bipinbhai Vadilal Mehta and Ors. ; Ashok Chaturvedi and Ors. v. Shitul H. Chanchani and Anr. : State of West Bengal and Ors. v. Swapan Kumar Guha and Ors. ; Jagdish Mitter Maini v. Canara Bank and Anr. 2000 III AD (Delhi) 137. Cumulative affect of above decisions, according to Mr. Mathur, is that High Court's power to quash an FIR and proceedings initiated on extraneous consideration is extremely wide. It does not in any way stand diluted. Respondent No. 5 in connivance with police officials tampered with evidence when they removed letters, diary, greeting cards and photographs etc. These documents do not form part of the challan. If placed on record it will conclusively prove the allegations of the complainant to be absolutely false and baseless. The factum of removal of the letters, diary, greeting cards and photographs has been admitted by all the respondents, though the police officer in their affidavit have tried to wriggle out of their illegal act by saying that these letters, greeting cards, diary and photographs were voluntarily given by the petitioner as those belonged to the complainant hence were seized yet not produced with the challan. These by no stretch of imagination Officer not only committed illegality buy tampered and destroying the evidence. There was no question of petitioner voluntarily handing over these documents. Police is trying to cover up its misdeeds.

12. So far as the charge under Section 406 IPC is concerned Mr. Mathur contended qua the petitioner it must necessarily fail. Perusal of the FIR clearly show that respondent No. 5 or for that matter her family members never entrusted any property to this petitioner. In the absence of entrustment the petitioner cannot prima facie be held guilty of misappropriation. Even otherwise respondent No. 5 has made general allegations against the petitioner ascribing no specific role to him. The allegations made being omnibus allegations can be read to his advantage. Even if the allegations made in the FIR are accepted on its face value the petitioner can neither be convicted under Sections 406 IPC nor under Section 498A IPC. Complainant has named each and every member of the family just as a pressure tactics.

13. Mr. Mathur contended that a comprehensive legally drafted and well thought out complaint was lodged after 2 years of leaving the matrimonial house. There was no occasion for the police to build up new case by recording supplementary statement of the complainant. In her statement she specifically stated that except her father she did not disclose these facts to anyone. Hence the affidavit of neighbour obtained by the police was motivated. it was procured to falsely implicate the petitioner and his family. According to complainant's own showing she left the matrimonial home on 5th September, 1997, whereas she lodged the complaint on 9th July, 1999 i.e. almost after two years. The delay in lodging the complaint remained unexplained. In fact this complaint was a counter blast to her husband's petition for divorce filed on 26th May, 1999 on which notice was issued on 3rd July, 1999. Notice could not be served on complainant because her house was found locked on 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th & 10th July, 1999. On learning that her husband had filed divorce petition she got legally drafted complaint. Reading of the said complaint leaves no manner of doubt that dates of alleged incidents mentioned in complaint and Hindi typed sentences are duly deliberated, thought out and manufactured to rope in petitioner's family. It is not a spontaneous complaint. Long drawn complaint can't be but deliberated, calculated and fabricated, no action on the same can be taken. To support his contention Mr. Dinesh Mathur, Senior Advocate, relied on the decision of Supreme Court in the cases of Datar Singh v. The State of Punjab as well as Kans Raj v. State of Punjab and Ors. .

14. On the other hand Mr. P.N. Lekhi, Senior Advocate, appearing for respondent No. 5 vehemently contended that allegations in the FIR squarely make out case under Section 498A and 406 IPC. Contents of the complaint show petitioner to be guilty and his cruelty inflicted on respondent No. 5 squarely fall under the provisions of Section 498A IPC. He, however, accepted that ordinary conduct is not covered under the definition of Section 498-A IPC. Mr. P.N. Lekhi contended that the Statement of Objects and Reasons can be referred to if there is any doubt raised regarding the scope and intent of the amendment in the I.P.C. by virtue of which Section 498A was inserted. To support his contentions he referred to the case of Utkal Contractors and Joinery Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Orissa wherein Apex Court observed:-

""A statute is best understood if we know the reason for it. The Statement of Objects and Reasons are what is known as the Heydon's Rule.""
17. That filing of the divorce petition by the petitioner's son will not absolve the petitioner of the offence committed by him and other members of his family. In fact his son filed the divorce petition in order to cover up the cruelty committed towards the complainant. Complainant was not aware of the divorce petition having been filed by her husband when she lodged the complaint. The delay in filing the complaint has already been explained in the complaint itself. She and her family members were making efforts to bring about the reconciliation hence did not deem it proper to rush to the police.

18. Before we deal with the case on merits we may make it clear that charge sheet in this case has already been filed. With that charge-sheet supplementary statement of the complainant and other documents have been filed. Question arose whether for deciding this petition at this stage can this court look into and rely on all the papers filed with the charge-sheet. Mr. D.C. Mathur, Sr. Advocate fairly conceded that the documents forming part of the charge-sheet can also be perused while considering then question of quashing the FIR.

19. In order to appreciate respective merits of the case as urged by counsel for the parties, we may have glance to the provision of Section 498-A and 406 IPC which are reproduced as under:-

406. Punishment for criminal breach of trust.-
Whomever commits criminal breach of trust shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.

22. Keeping the intention of the legislature in mind we have to see whether the conduct of this petitioner as alleged by respondent No. 5 in her complaint dated 9th July, 1999, as well as of supplementary statement dated 10.7.99 and other documents relied by the prosecution amount to cruelty falling under explanation.

On 23.9.96 I went back to my parents house along with my husband for Pheras and my parents gave me sweets and gifts for my in-laws (as stated in the Annexure-A). On my return to the house some of the relatives from in-laws side were also present in the house and when I showed the gifts and sweets to them, they made fun of me and taunted me along with my mother-in-law and brother-in-law that they are not happy with what I have got and said that all these things even a Peon can give to his daughter and look at your standard.

3. My agony continued with each occasion which followed month after month. On Karva Chauth i.e. 22.10.96 my father along with one of his cousin came to my house with lot of gifts, cloths, sweets and utensils as per the custom for my mother-in-law, brother-in-law, husband and father-in-law. Momemnt they left all of them started abusing me and taunting me stating that nothing is being given as per their standard and they had expected more than this. My mother-in-law also demanded that as per this custom gold is to be given on this occasion, but your parents have not given anything and I was aghast and shocked with their behavior and tried to ask my husband as to what is wrong in the gifts which have been given. Instead of replying he slapped me and I had no option but to suffer and sulk within myself which resulted in lot of mental trauma and physical tension which effected my health.

4. On the Diwali day i.e. 10.11.96 again my parents Along with my relatives came to our house with lot of gifts and sweets and my in-laws instead of welcoming them were rude and dry to them. After they left once again my brother-in-law Along with my mother-in-law showered the filthiest abuses and taunts and also did not give any food to me to eat on that day. On the next morning my mother-in-law gave stale food for me to eat. My father-in-law and husband also taunted me and said that I am a liability on them as there are no gains from me to them.

5. On the Lohri day i.e. 13.1.97 since my in-laws were not celebrating the same as there was a death in their family, my father Along with his friend visited the house during the day time and gave Rs. 5,000/- to my mother-in-law as a Sagun for this day and told her that since there was a death in the family he has not got any gifts or sweets. My mother-in-law at that time quietly took over the money, but moment they left all of them punched on me with the same taunts and also my father-in-law and my husband gave me beating with sticks. I had no option at that moment but to be quite and suffered silently and also did not tell anybody about the same since I wanted to save my marriage and probably thought that one day they will realize their mistake.

6. On 13th January' 97 my mother-in-law in the night told me that since tomorrow is an auspicious day i.e. 14th January, I will remove your Chudda, ask your father to send same gifts and cloths for her. But I could not inform my father, so next morning I myself went to market and bought a suit for her along with certain Puja items and sweets but she didn't like them and started abusing me and my parents for not giving her anything.

7. As a mark of respect I used to hand over all the items and gifts to my mother-in-law i.e. jewellery. Sarees and were being kept with my mother-in-law. Certain cloths of my daily use were with me and were Along with some piece of jewellery like 2 pairs of gold earrings and 2 rings for my daily use, but the keys of the almirah were always with my husband. It is worth mentioning here that the items like tape recorder, transistor, emergency light, certain sarees, 6 bed sheets, certain crockery items which were given to me on different occasions by my parents were handed over to my brother-in-law by me on instructions of my mother-in-law as she told me that these items will berequired at the time of the brother-in-law as she told me that these items will be required at the time of the brother-in-law's marriage. My in-laws and my brother not only used to taunt me but all of them use to beat me on one pretext or the other. I was not allowed to touch anything of the house and also even if there were any phone calls for me which I used to attend, my brother-in-law in the filthiest language to use tell me ""PHONE TERE BAAP KA NAHIN HAI, BILL TERE BAAP KE GHAR SE NAHIN JATA, JO PHONE use KARTI HIA."" He further started insulting everyone, who so ever use to call me like my friends, relatives and including my parents.

8. My brother-in-law was so cruel and a rowdy character that he is fact used to beat me with belt and a stick lying in the house. On my complaint my husband used to tell me that since I was not earning enough of money so therefore these problems would continue. In fact he was so unfair and cruel in making statements like if you meant to be happy in this house you earn about Rs. 20,000/- to Rs. 25,000/- a month an give it to them. Nobody would dare to say anything to you. He further used to give me example of his cousins who were married into rich families and he used to tell me that their wives are earning Rs. 30,000/-, 40,000/- per month and nobody dares to say anything to them and at the time of monetary needs their in-laws always help them, but look at your parents, they have not given anything to make you happy.

9. My father-in-law and on different occasions my mother-in-law and my husband used to tell me that my parents should sell of their immovable properties lying useless at my native place and should arrange to buy a flat for them in a good locality in Delhi. To save my matrimonial life I continued suffer silently and did not raise my voice and tried to adjust to the maximum. However they did nt mend their ways and continued to torture me in different ways including the way mentioned above. Because of this torture and the cruel behavior of my husband, brother-in-laws, and mother-in-law and father-in-law I suffered great physical and mental pain and agony. So much so that on number of occasions I had nervous breakdown and the Doctors attending to me categtorrically diagnosed that my indisposition was mainly became of mental tension. Apart from this on more than once occasion I suffered physical injury in my body on more than one occasions as mentioned above.

10. My brother-in-law, mother-in-law, also started taunting and insulting me at the relatives places whenever I used to go there with them and used to make fun of me. In the month of June' 97 on once such occasion me my husband my mother-in-law and brother-in-law went to reside for a day at one of the relative in Faridabad. In the morning my husband and my brother-in-law had a fight for some reason and my husband became furious and asked me to leave the place along with him. I did same when my husband asked for the car keys from my brother-in-law & my brother-in-law and my mother-in-law told my husband in front of me ""Iske baap ki gaadi nahin hai, gadi mein ghumna hai to Iske baap ko bol kam se kam thodi sharm kar le aur apni beti aur damad ke liye ek car to kharid de, itni hasiyat to hai uski."" That day I came back with my husband in scorching heat. Since we had to walk for about two kilometres to catch the bus for Delhi, I suffered from severe sunstroke and no body took care of me.

11. On 5.9.1997 it was a usual morning in the house as usual there was a fight between my husband and my father-in-law which I have seen right from the day one of my entering the house with regard to some joint property money. I told my husband that why he is fighting for money with his father, he should stand on his own feet. To this my husband told me that I will be like this only if you don't like you can leave this house and slapped a newspaper on my face. I was slightly agitated on this and proved my father and asked him to come to the Court as I was wanted to tell him some thing since things were unbearable for me. I came outside the room and my mother-law-law started abusing me for nothing. To which I told that you are the one who has created all the problems because of her greediness of money. Moment I said this my brother-in-law started hitting me on my head with a belt in his hand and seeing my father-in-law and my husband silently watching this later on also joined my brother-in-law and also started hitting me with blows and legs. My husband then dragged me to my room and locked me inside my room, luckily the phone was in my room and I immediately called my father and asked him to come as soon as possible, Since I could not bear the humiliation and injuries I could hear outside the room filthiest abuses and languages being said by my mother-in-law an brother-in-law. ""YEH DO TAKE KI AURAT APNE APP KO KYA SAMAJHATI HAI, IS KE BAAP NE KYA DIYA HAI, JO ISSE APNE GHAR MEIN RAKHE JO ISKE PAAS THA, WOH TO MIL GYA AB KYA RAKHA HAI IS MEIN DAFA KARO YAHAN SE."" I immediately phoned my father and asked him to come home directly. My father reached in 40 minutes. My husband in the meantime and opened the door and pushed me outside the house so I sat in the neighbours house. When I saw my father climbing up I called him and told him about the incidents and my father told me not to worry and pacified me and told me that he will talk to them. My brother-in-law had already left the house. My father-in-law and my husband apologised to my father for their act and requested him that you take her back for few days and my husband said that he would pick me up after 3-4 days. Despite their tortures and the cruel behavior I did not inform to anybody about this incident except my father for the sake of saving my marriage. However, I continued my efforts to talk my husband after this. But he always deferred the issue on one pretest or the other. Of late he even started saying that ""I was their with him only on a trial basis since the trial period is over the file must be consigned to record room."" My husband always used to boost about his contacts in judiciary and other circles and used to say that nobody can do any harm to him, no matter what may come he will never continued this relationship. During my stay with my parents number of time I demanded my Shri Dhan from my husband, his brother and parents, but all of them point blank refused to return the same which was kept with them. All of them on different occasion had a strange demand that I should agree for divorce on mutual consent so that my husband could be remarried to a rich family, according to them there were lot of such offers, even after my marriage to him and my mother-in-law also told me that girls are available in plenty of numbers there is no dearth of girls for his boy. They can choose and get anything they want among the girls an there was no need of yours. She use to say ""KUDIYAN DA KOI GHATA NAHIN, BATHERIAN MILDIYAN NE"".

12. On number of occasions I told my husband in the court premises that since I was not having sufficient income to support myself, so therefore he should pay me at least my pocket expenses and day to day expenses to maintain myself, but he always refused to do so. I through all quarters kept on making efforts and always hoped that some sense would prevail over them but thing went bad to worse. I may also inform your goodself that my relatives namely Mr. Ranjeet Brar, Mr. Joginder Mann, Mr. Gurdev Brar, My father and My younger brother and common friends namely Mrs. Anusuya Salwan etc. had made efforts to reconcile the issue but due to the greedy nature of the accused persons and their lust for dowry they had refused for any settlement.

13. That recently I have started receiving threatening telephonic calls from my in-laws or at their behest that in case I do not accept their illegal and unjustified demands me and my family will have to face dire consequences.

Now I am left with no option but to lodge this complaint and I request your goodself to kindly book the accused persons and take appropriate actions by registering a case against Mr. Manoj Khanna, Mr. Raj Kumar Khanna, Rohit Khanna and Mrs. Nirmal Khanna for causing physical and mental torture for demanding dowry and for not returning my Shri Dhan and refusing to maintain me.

New Delhi Dated: ; 9-7-99 Complainant Inderjeet Sidhu d/o Sh. P.S. Sidhu r/o G-109 Naraina Vihar, New Delhi - 110 028.

25. Though the complaint was not paragraphed but for the sake of convenience it has been paragraphed and numbered.

26. Perusal of the complaint reproduced above show that qua the petitioner allegations are general in nature. In paras 4 & 5 of the complaint allegation against the petitioner are of harassment. Mr. Mathur contended that these allegation cann't constitute 'cruelty' having nexus with demand. The only other allegation which can relotely be said to be cruelty is in para 9 where she says petitioner along with other members of his family suggested that her parents should sell their immovable property lying useless at her native place and buy them a house in good locality in Delhi. Except the allegation in para 9 she has not attributed any cruelty against the petitioner linking with any kind of demand. In para 11 she says she left the house on 5th September, 1997 because of he fight had nothing to do with her. Reading of para 11 shows that petitioner has not been accused of any cruelty rather as per her own showing, the petitioner apologised to her father who came to take her. She left the matrimonial home on 5th September, 1997 and after almost two years she lodged the complaint on 9th July, 1999 involving all the members of her husband's family.

28. Mr. D.C. Mathur also challenged the date of recording the supplementary statement. According to him it was not recorded on 10th July, 1999. It was ante-dated by the police in order to cover up the illegal raid conducted at the instance of the complainant thereby removing all the articles even belonging to petitioner's family. In her complaint dated 9.7.99 which was a well drafted complaint, she nowhere alleged that her ""stridhan"" was lying in the house of the petitioner. But police under presumption conducted the raid on 12.7.1999 and arrested petitioner and his wife. Therefore, to cover up the lapse police recorded supplementary statement on 10.9.1999 but changed the figure of 9 to 7 making it appear 10.7.1999. The supplementary statement even does not implicate the petitioner under Section 406 or under Section 498A IPC.

We have scrutinised the original file. There appears to be overwriting on figure 9. It is changed to 7. Mr. Mathur urged that recording of the supplementary statement was after thought to cover up the illegal act committed by police. We would not like to comment on the merits of the same as it may effect the case before the trial court.

For the foregoing reasons we hold that no offence under Section 406 IPC in the facts of this case qua the petitioner prima facia has been made out. Accordingly FIR and proceedings emanating there from under Section 406 IPC are ordered to be quashed. But at this stage we are not inclined to quash the FIR under Section 498A IPC. It would be for the Trial Court to consider whether charge is made out or not?

With these observations the petition stands disposed. Any observation made herinabove will have no bearing on the merits of the case before the Trial Court."
Savitri Devi vs Ramesh Chand And Ors.,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/11307/,"Delhi High Court
Savitri Devi vs Ramesh Chand And Ors. on 19 May, 2003
1. Though State has the locus standi to prefer such petitions, since petitioner is the wife and on her complaint case was registered and charge sheet was filed, and has grievance against the order dated 13.3.2002 passed by Ms. Nisha Saxena, Metropolitan Magistrate this is being entertained.

2. Vide impugned order charge for the offence punishable under Section 406, IPC for misappropriation of dowry articles and istridhan was framed against her husband only and her father-in-law, brothers-in-law and sister-in-law (wife of one of the brothers of her husband) and her unmarried sister-in-law were discharged and charge for the offence under Section 498A IPC i.e. harassment of the wife by the husband and his relatives for inadequate dowry or non-fulfillment of demands of dowry was framed against the husband and father-in-law alone. According to the petitioner/wife, every member of the family though the elder brother of the husband died during the proceedings should have been subjected to trial for both the offences viz offence under Section 498A, IPC as well as 406 IPC.

3. The allegations in brief are that after marriage her in-laws specially her father-in-law and her husband and the brother-in-law did not like the dowry articles and expressed their unhappiness that they were not given Hero Honda and cash of Rs. 50,000/-. The wife of elder brother of her husband Ms. Mukesh and the sister of her husband did not like the clothes given for them and Ms. Mukesh represented that if Sanjay had married her younger sister then he would have got more dowry. The main allegations of harassment were against the husband and father-in-law. There were no allegations of demand of dowry against other relatives.

4. The main contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that non-acceptance of the gifts by respondents and others tantamount to harassment and cruelty as defined in Section 498A, IPC.

10. When analysis of such human sensibilities, affairs and conduct is under discussion, I would be failing if I don't quote Lord Denning, a celebrated and legendary Judge of this century. Lord Denning says :-

""When the conduct consists of direct action by one against the other, it can then properly be said to be aimed at the other, even though there is no desire to injure the other or to inflict misery on him. Thus, it may consist of a display of temperament, emotion, or perversion whereby the one gives vent to his or her own feelings, not intending to injure the other, but making the other the object-the butt- at whose expense the emotion is relieved,""
11. Supreme Court of India laid the following definition of ""mental cruelty"" in V. Bhagat v. Mrs. D. Bhagat, :-

""Mental cruelty can be broadly defined as that conduct which inflicts upon the other party such mental pain and suffering as would make it not possible for the party to live with the other. In other words ""mental cruelty"" must be of such a nature that the parties cannot reasonably be expected to live together. The situation must be such that the wronged party cannot reasonably be asked to put with such conduct and continue to live with the other party. It is not necessary to prove that the mental cruelty is such as to cause injury to the health of the petitioner.
The word ""cruelty"" is to be used in relation to human conduct or human behavior. It is the conduct in relation or in respect of matrimonial duties and obligations. It is a course of conduct of one which is adversely affecting the other. The cruelty' may be mental or physical, intentional or unintentional.""""
12. In S. Hanumanta Rao v. S. Ramani, , Supreme Court observed as under:-

""Mental cruelty broadly means, when either party causes mental pain, agony or suffering of such a magnitude that it severs the bond between the wife and the husband and as a result of which it becomes impossible for the party who has suffered to live with the other party.""
13. Parameters of what constitutes cruelty in matrimonial affairs have been well carved out in American Jurisprudence 2nd edition Vol 24 page 206. These are;-

""The question whether the misconduct complained of constitutes cruelty and the like for divorce purposes is determined primarily by its effect upon the particular person complaining of the acts. The question is not whether the conduct would be cruel to a reasonable person or a person of average or normal sensibilities, but whether it would have that effect upon the aggrieved spouse. That which may be cruel to one person may be laughed off by another, and what may not be cruel to an individual under one set of circumstances may be extreme cruelty under another set of circumstances.""
20. It appears that the legislature was mindful of the fact and situation that this provision may be exploited that it defined 'cruelty' and for that purpose ""harassment"" falling within the parameters of ""intentional conduct' ""of such a degree that may either drive the woman to commit suicide or cause danger to life, limb or health or cause 'grave' injury. Of course ""health"" means not only physical but mental also. But unfortunately, these provisions have been abused by the Investigating and Prosecuting Agencies and exploited by the women and their relatives to such an extent that these have proved to be most ineffective in curbing the evil of dowry as well as disciplining the husband and his relatives to treat the woman in human and humane manner and give the bride or wife proper respect and honour.

22. This Court has dealt with thousands of cases and matters relating to dowry deaths and cases registered under Section 498A/406/306 IPC arising out of domestic violence, harassment of women on account of inadequate dowry or coercion of the woman for not fulfillling the demand of dowry and hundred of divorce cases arising there from. Experience is not so happy nor is implementation or enforcement of these laws is anything but satisfactory or punctilious.

23. These provisions were though made with good intentions but the implementation has left a very bad taste and the move has been counter productive. There is a growing tendency amongst the women which is further perpetuated by their parents and relatives to rope in each and every relative-including minors and even school going kids nearer or distant relatives and in some cases against every person of the family of the husband whether living away or in other town or abroad and married, unmarried sisters, 'sister-in-laws, unmarried brothers, married uncles and in some cases grand-parents or as many as 10 to 15 or even more relatives of the husband. Once a complaint is lodged under Sections 498A/406 IPC whether there are vague, unspecific or exaggerated allegations or there is no evidence of any physical or mental harm or injury inflicted upon woman that is likely to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health, it comes as an easy tool in the hands of Police and agencies like Crime Against Women Cell to hound them with the threat of arrest making them run here and there and force them to hide at their friends or relatives houses till they get anticipatory bail as the offence has been made cognizable and non-bailable. Thousands of such complaints and cases are pending and are being lodged day in and day out.

24. These provisions have resulted into large number of divorce cases as when one member of the family is arrested and sent to jail without any immediate reprieve of bail, the chances of salvaging or surviving the marriage recede into background and marriage for all practical purposes becomes dead. The aftermath of this is burdensome, insupportable and miserable more for the woman. Remarriage is not so easy. Once bitten is twice scared. Woman lacking in economic independence starts feeling as burden over their parents and brothers. Result is that major bulk of the marriages die in their infancy, several others in few years. The marriage ends as soon as a complaint is lodged and the cognizance is taken by the police.

25. It was primarily a social problem and social evil but has been allowed to be dealt with iron and heavy hands of the police. These provisions have tendency to destroy whole social fabric as power to arrest anybody by extending or determining the definition of harassment or cruelty vests with the lower police functionaries and not with officers of higher rank who have intellectual capacity to deal with the subject.

26. For ages the cruelty, desertion and adultery have been ground for divorce which were to be proved in civil courts. Now the police and that too its lower functionaries have been made the decision making authority to conclude whether the harassment or the cruelty as brought out in the statement of the complainant wife is sufficient to put all the relatives including school going minor brothers and sisters of the husband behind the bar. Such was neither the intention nor the object of the legislation.

27. It is rightly said sometimes the remedies are worse than the perils or disease. Having seen and experienced the enforcement of these laws for decades, time has come to take stock and review them as thousands of marriages have been sacrificed at the altar of this provision. In one metropolis alone, thousands divorce cases arising from the cases under Section 498A/406 IPC are pending in Courts. There are equal or more number of marriages which are in limbo. What else is it if not a social catastrophy ? This should be a matter of concern for social scientists, law-makers and Judges also. Sterner provisions have failed to make any dent. Menace and evil of dowry is still looming large. In the words of Supreme Court (Pawan Kumar's Case, ) in spite of stringent measures, sections of society are still boldly pursuing this chronic evil to fulfilll their greedy desires.

28. It does not mean that the wolves masquarding in the human flesh should be given a free hand. They should rather be dealt with iron hand. Again it is because of tendency to involve innocent persons that the Supreme Court has cautioned the courts to act with circumspection. In the words of Supreme Court ""Often innocent persons are also trapped or brought in with ulterior motives and therefore this places an arduous duty on the court to separate such individuals from the offenders. Hence the courts have to deal such cases with circumspection, sift through the evidence with caution, scrutinize the circumstances with utmost care.""

29. To start with, marital offences under Sections 498A/406 IPC be made bailable , if no grave physical injury is inflicted and necessarily compoundable. If the parties decide to either settle their disputes amicably to salvage the marriage or decide to put an end to their marriage by mutual divorce, they should be allowed to compound the offences so that criminal proceedings don't chase them if they want to start their marital life afresh or otherwise. The past should not haunt them nor the hatchet they have buried should be allowed to be dug up and mar their present life or future married life.

30. Lastly in view of sensitivity of such offences and in order to avoid clumsiness in human relations and viewing this problem from human and social point of view, and the law as it stands today it is required that the investigation into these offences be vested in civil authorities like Executive Magistrates and after his finding as to the commission of the offence, cognizance should be taken. Till such a mechanism is evolved, no police officer below the rank of ACP for the offences under Section 498A/406 IPC and D.C.P for the offence under Section 304-B IPC i.e dowry death should be vested with investigation and where minor school going children are named, they shall not be attested and be sent to the court for taking cognizance and further proceedings. Their arrest ruin their future life and lower them in their self esteem. This court has even dealt with the bail applications and prosecution of children merely for the fact that their names also figured in the complaint lodged by the wife. In certain cases even grand-parents of the husband who are in their eighties & nineties suffer this traumatic situation.

31. There is growing tendency to come out with inflated and exaggerated allegations roping in each and every relation of the husband and if one of them happens to be of higher status or of vulnerable standing, he or she becomes an easy prey for better bargaining and blackmailing.

32. These ground realities have pursuaded this court to recommend to the authorities and law makers to have a review of the situation and legal provision.

33. Copy of the order be sent to Law Secretary, Union of India."

Pinakin Mahipatray Rawal vs State Of Gujarat on 9 September, 2013
K.S. RADHAKRISHNAN, J.

1. We are in this case concerned with the question as to whether the relationship between A-1 and A-2 was extra-marital leading to cruelty within the meaning of Section 498A IPC and also amounted to abetment leading to the act of suicide within the meaning of Section 306 IPC.

2. A-1, the first accused, along with A-2 and A-3, were charge-sheeted for the offences punishable under Sections 498A, 304-B and 306 IPC. The Sessions Court convicted A-1 for the offence punishable under Section 498A IPC and sentenced him to suffer RI for three years and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- and in default to undergo further RI for six months. A-1 was also convicted for offence punishable under Section 306 IPC and sentenced to suffer RI for 10 years and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- and in default to undergo further RI for six months. A-2 and A-3, the mother of A-1 were, however, acquitted of the various offences alleged against them. The trial Court also acquitted A-1 of the offence charged against him under Section 304-B IPC. On appeal by A-1, the High Court though confirmed the conviction, modified the sentence under Section 498A IPC to two years’ RI and a fine of Rs.2,500/- and in default to undergo further RI for six months, and for the offence under Section 306 IPC, the sentence was reduced to RI for five years and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- and in default to undergo RI for one year. It was ordered that the sentences would run concurrently. Aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court, this appeal has been preferred by A-1.

3. Shri Sanjay Visen, learned counsel appearing for the Appellant, submitted that the allegations raised against the accused in respect of the alleged extra-marital relationship with second accused would not constitute an offence under Section 498A IPC. Learned counsel also submitted that the suicidal death of the deceased was not a direct result of the alleged extra- marital relationship and would not constitute an offence punishable under Section 306 IPC. Learned counsel also submitted that even assuming that the Appellant was maintaining extra-marital relationship with the second accused, there is no mens rea proved to show that such relationship was maintained by the accused with an intention to drive the deceased to commit suicide. Placing reliance upon the suicide note Ex.44, learned counsel submitted that the deceased did not allege any cruelty or harassment on the part of the accused which led the deceased to commit suicide. Learned counsel submitted that in any view, the conduct of the accused or the alleged relationship he had with A-2 was not of such a degree that would incite/provoke or push the deceased to a depressed situation to end her life.

4. Mrs. Sumita Hazarika, learned counsel appearing for the State, on the other hand submitted that extra-marital relationship between the first and second accused was of such a degree to disturb the mental balance of the deceased, which amounted to cruelty within the explanation to Section 498A IPC. Referring to various letters written by the deceased to her father, learned counsel pointed out that those letters would clearly depict the trauma undergone by her, which ultimately drove her to commit suicide. Learned counsel also referred to the latter part of the suicide note and submitted that the same would indicate that A-1 and A-2 were in love and that A-1 wanted to marry A-2 and it was for their happiness that the deceased committed suicide. Learned counsel submitted that the Courts below have correctly appreciated the documentary as well as oral evidence of this case, which calls for no interference by this Court.

Prosecution story entirely rests on the nature of relationship A-1 had with A-2.

8. Prosecution stand is that the above mentioned letters would disclose the feelings and sufferings of an unfortunate wife having come to know of the love affair between her husband A-1 and his colleague A-2, which ultimately led her to commit the act of suicide. Further, it is also the stand of the prosecution that the deceased died within seven years of marriage and hence under Section 113A of the Evidence Act, the Court can presume, having regard to all other circumstances of the case, that such suicide had been abetted by the husband.

12. Alienation of affection by a stranger, if proved, is an intentional tort i.e. interference in the marital relationship with intent to alienate one spouse from the other. Alienation of affection is known as “Heart Balm” action. Anglo-Saxon common law on alienation of affection has not much roots in this country, the law is still in its nascent stage. Anglo- Saxon based action against third parties involving tortuous interference with the marital relationship was mainly compensatory in nature which was earlier available to the husband, but, of late, a wife could also lay such a claim complaining of alienation of affection. The object is to preserve marital harmony by deterring wrongful interference, thereby to save the institution of marriage. Both the spouses have a valuable interest in the married relationship, including its intimacy, companionship, support, duties, affection, welfare of children etc.

14. We are, however, of the view that for a successful prosecution of such an action for alienation of affection, the loss of marital relationship, companionship, assistance, loss of consortium, etc. as such may not be sufficient, but there must be clear evidence to show active participation, initiation or encouragement on the part of a third party that he/she must have played a substantial part in inducing or causing one spouse’s loss of other spouse’s affection. Mere acts, association, liking as such do not become tortuous. Few countries and several States in the United States of America have passed legislation against bringing in an action for alienation of affection, due to various reasons, including the difficulties experienced in assessing the monetary damages and few States have also abolished “criminal conversation” action as well.

16. Action for alienation of affection lies for all improper intrusions or assaults on the marriage relationship by another, whether or not associated with “extramarital sex”, his or her continued overtures or sexual liaisons can be construed as something akin to an assumption of risk that his/her conduct will injure the marriage and give rise to an action. But all the same, a person is not liable for alienation of affection for merely becoming a passive object of affection. The liability arises only if there is any active participation, initiation or encouragement on the part of the defendant. Acts which lead to the loss of affection must be wrongful, intentional, calculated to entice the affection of one spouse away from the other, in order to support a cause of action for alienation of affection. For proving a claim for alienation of affection it is not necessary for a party to prove an adulterous relationship.

18. Marital relationship means the legally protected marital interest of one spouse to another which include marital obligation to another like companionship, living under the same roof, sexual relation and the exclusive enjoyment of them, to have children, their up-bringing, services in the home, support, affection, love, liking and so on. Extra-marital relationship as such is not defined in the IPC. Though, according to the prosecution in this case, it was that relationship which ultimately led to mental harassment and cruelty within the explanation to Section 498- A and that A-1 had abetted the wife to commit suicide. We have to examine whether the relationship between A-1 and A-2 amounted to mental harassment and cruelty.

22. We are of the view that the mere fact that the husband has developed some intimacy with another, during the subsistence of marriage and failed to discharge his marital obligations, as such would not amount to “cruelty”, but it must be of such a nature as is likely to drive the spouse to commit suicide to fall within the explanation to Section 498A IPC. Harassment, of course, need not be in the form of physical assault and even mental harassment also would come within the purview of Section 498A IPC. Mental cruelty, of course, varies from person to person, depending upon the intensity and the degree of endurance, some may meet with courage and some others suffer in silence, to some it may be unbearable and a weak person may think of ending one’s life. We, on facts, found that the alleged extra marital relationship was not of such a nature as to drive the wife to commit suicide or that A-1 had ever intended or acted in such a manner which under normal circumstances, would drive the wife to commit suicide.

23. We also notice in this case that the wife committed suicide within seven years of the date of the marriage. Hence, a presumption under Section 113A of the Evidence Act could be drawn.

26. Section 306 refers to abetment of suicide. It says that if any person commits suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years and shall also be liable to fine. The action for committing suicide is also on account of mental disturbance caused by mental and physical cruelty. To constitute an offence under Section 306, the prosecution has to establish that a person has committed suicide and the suicide was abetted by the accused. Prosecution has to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased committed suicide and the accused abetted the commission of suicide. But for the alleged extra marital relationship, which if proved, could be illegal and immoral, nothing has been brought out by the prosecution to show that the accused had provoked, incited or induced the wife to commit suicide.

27. We have on facts found that at best the relationship of A-1 and A-2 was a one-sided love affair, the accused might have developed some likings towards A-2, his colleague, all the same, the facts disclose that A-1 had discharged his marital obligations towards the deceased. There is no evidence of physical or mental torture demanding dowry. Deceased might have been under serious “emotional stress” in the sense that she had undergone an abortion in the year 1992, and the year following that, though a daughter was born to her, the daughter also died few days of its birth. After one or two years, she committed suicide. Evidence, in any way, is lacking in this case to hold, that due to the alleged relationship between A-1 and A-2, A-1 had intended or intentionally inflicted any emotional stress on the deceased wife, so as to drive her to the extreme step of ending her life. In the suicide note she had not made any accusations as such against A-1 or A-2, on the other hand she stated that it was she who was selfish and egoist. Suicide note (Ex.44), which was translated by the High Court, reads as under :-

“My husband Pinakin is a very good man and he is not responsible. I also love him. However, I am extremely bad, selfish and egoist and, therefore, not a match to him.
He is in love with Priti Bhakt, serving in LIC and wants to marry her and, therefore, for their happiness, I am taking this step.
No one of my house is responsible. Therefore, they may not be harassed. Kindly arrange their marriage with all pomp and gaiety. I gift my dead body to the medical students and I donate my eyes to the blinds.
Yours Jagruti This is my last wish which be fulfilled for the peace of my soul.”
28. Suicide note completely exonerates A-1, which states that he was not responsible for death of the deceased. On the other hand, the deceased described herself as extremely selfish, egoist and, therefore, not a match for A-1. She entertained the belief that her husband A-1 was in love with A-2 and wanted to marry A-2. Note states it was for their happiness she had decided to end her life. She also wanted to have the marriage of A-1 and A-2 solemnized with pomp and gaiety. On reading the suicide note, one can infer that the deceased was so possessive of her husband, and was always under an emotional stress that she might lose her husband. Too much of possessiveness could also lead to serious emotional stress, over and above the fact that she had one abortion and her daughter died after few days of birth. No evidence is forthcoming in this case to show that A-2 ever evinced any interest to marry A-1. On the other hand, during the subsistence of the alleged relationship, A-2 herself got married.

29. We are, therefore, of the considered view that the relationship A-1 had with A-2 was not of such a nature which under normal circumstances would drive one to commit suicide or that A-1 by his conduct or otherwise ever abetted or intended to abet the wife to commit suicide. Courts below, in our view, have committed serious error in holding that it was due to the extra marital relationship A-1 had with A-2 that led the deceased to take the extreme step to commit suicide, and A-1 was instrumental for the said act. In the circumstances, we are inclined to allow this appeal and set aside the order of conviction and sentence imposed on the appellant, and he is set at liberty. Ordered as above."

SATISH CHANDRA SHARMA, J.

1. Leave granted.

2. These Appeals by special leave are directed against Order dt.14.11.2018 passed by the High Court of Allahabad in Criminal Revision No. 612/2004 filed against the judgment and order dt.

18.11.2004 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Lucknow [hereinafter “Sessions Court”] whereby the Criminal Appeal No. 17:29:46 IST Reason:

88/2004 filed by the Appellant was dismissed and the conviction of the Appellant under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (hereinafter “IPC” & Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 [hereinafter “DP Act, 1961”] vide Judgment dt. 28.08.2004 passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Lucknow [hereinafter “Magistrate”] was upheld. The Order dt. 28.11.2018 dismissing the recall application against the said Order dt.14.11.2018 is also under challenge before this Court.
3. The captioned Appeal arises out of Case Crime No. 60/1999 lodged by the PS Women Police Station, Lucknow under Sections 498A, 323, 506 IPC & Sections 3 & 4 of the D.P. Act, 1961, on the basis of a Complaint dt. 20.12.1999 filed by the Complainant wife, against the Appellant husband and her in-laws alleging mental and physical torture for not bringing enough dowry. The factual conspectus in brief is as under:
3.1 The marriage of the Appellant with the Complainant, Ms. Mala Chaddha, had taken place on 12.02.1997. The Appellant resided separately with the Complainant wife only for a period of 12 days, from 08.09.1998 to 20.09.1998.
3.2 The Complainant who was working as a teacher with St. Thomas School prior to her marriage had allegedly resigned from her job on the advice of the Appellant husband; and her family had spent more than Rs. 5 lakhs towards the wedding. However, the Appellant, her in-laws, and the brother-in-law (Jeth) were constantly unhappy & dissatisfied, and subjected her to constant taunts, and inflicted upon her physical and mental atrocities. It is alleged that the Appellant husband and her in-laws forced the Complainant to consume milk mixed with some narcotic/alcoholic substances, and forced upon her to attend parties with his friends, where alcohol was served, and if the Complainant refused, the Appellant and his family would humiliate her. Allegedly, the parents-in-laws, in conspiracy with the Appellant, had planned to kill her, and had kept her in a safe house, separately from the matrimonial home, the keys for which were with the parents-in-law. On 23.09.1998, when the father of the Complainant was invited to the matrimonial house, the Appellant and her in-laws had allegedly assaulted the Complainant with kicks and punches in front of her father. The Appellant and his family purportedly expelled the Complainant, while she was pregnant. Thereafter, on 10.02.1998, the Appellant and her family again while ousting her out of the house, allegedly gave her a strong push, and as a result she fell down, and owing to the injury, had suffered a miscarriage. It is the case of the Complainant in the FIR that she made several requests for reconciliation including efforts through Family Counselling Centre till 16.12.1999, but it has been in vain, and as a consequence she registered the Complaint dt. 20.12.1999 against the Appellant and his family.
3.3 In her statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter “CrPC”), before the Magistrate, the Complainant reiterated the allegations in the FIR and stated for the first time that she was forced by the Appellant and his family to join service in St. Fidelis School, Aliganj, Lucknow and the in-
laws would snatch her entire month’s salary, which was only Rs. 4,000/- at the time. On 23.09.1998, when the Appellant raised a demand of Rs. 2 Lacs, and her parents were unable to arrange the money, the Appellant and the in-laws allegedly beat her up. The Complainant asserts that she only took with her four gold bangles and one ring, while leaving her matrimonial home in July 1997 and rest all jewellery and list of items were with the Appellant or his family.

3.4 The Complainant and her father were examined as PW-1 and PW-2, respectively. PW-2, has fully supported the testimony of PW-1, and in both the statements, the demand of Rs. 2 lakhs as dowry by the in-laws & the mental and physical atrocities inflicted on her, is persistent. However, both the witnesses could not substantiate the allegations of hurt or physical assault. The Trial Court vide Judgment dt. 28.08.2004, upon duly considering the testimony of both the witnesses and the material on record, observed that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt, the commission of offences under Sections 323 and 34 IPC, rendering the following opinion:

 “It is evident from perusal of the evidence available on record that both the fact witnesses have not made it clear in their evidence that any simple hurt was caused to the Complainant as a result of the physical assault by accused persons. Even if it is believed that the accused committed mar-pit with the Complainant, I think had the Complainant been subjected to physical assault by all the accused persons by kicks and punches, yet she would have sustained serious injuries and in such a situation, I am of the opinion that medical examination of the Complainant must have been done so as to prove that she has sustained injuries due to the assault by accused persons, but it appears from the perusal of the record that the prosecution did not attempted to adduce any such evidence before the court as any medical certificate/injury report with regard to the injuries of the Complainant has not been filed. In this context, the evidence of the complainant is the only strong evidence regarding the injuries, as she was subjected to physical assault by the accused persons but it appears from perusal of the testimony of the witness that she has nowhere mentioned in her statement that she sustained injuries on such and such part of her body due to the physical assault committed by accused persons.
 Besides, it is also evident from record that the prosecution has further stated that the complainant had miscarriage due to physical assault committed by accused persons. In my opinion, if such an incident had actually taken place, the complainant was required to get her medical examination done so as to prove that the miscarriage took place due to physical assault committed by the accused persons as a miscarriage is not a normal/ordinary course of events but it is clear from perusal of record that prosecution has not adduced any cogent evidence with regard to the miscarriage. Therefore, the allegation of miscarriage due to physical assault proves to be concocted story. In light of the foregoing discussion, I reach the conclusion that the prosecution has failed to prove the allegation of physical assault of the complainant and resultant simple hurt beyond reasonable doubt.” 3.5 The Trial Court vide Judgment dt. 28.08.2004, observed that although the prosecution had failed to prove its case against the Appellant & the co-accused persons, for offences under Section 323 r/w 34 and Section 506 IPC; it had proved beyond reasonable doubt, the case under Section 498A IPC and Section 4 of the D.P. Act, 1961 against the Appellant alone. The Trial Court acquitted the Appellant for offences under Section 323 r/w 34 and Section 506 IPC and convicted him for offences under Section 498A IPC and Section 4 of the D.P. Act, 1961. Accordingly, the Trial Court sentenced the Appellant as under:
Offence(s) under Period of Fine imposed Sentence Section 498A IPC, 1860 2 years RI Rs. 5000/-
4 DP Act, 1961 1 year RI Rs. 2000/-

3.6 The Criminal Appeal No. 88/2024 preferred by the Appellant against the Judgment dt. 28.08.2024 passed by the Magistrate, was dismissed by the Ld. Additional Sessions Judge, vide its Judgment/Final Order dt. 18.11.2004 and the conviction under Section 498A of IPC & Section 4 of the D.P. Act, 1961 & the quantum of sentence qua the Appellant was upheld. 3.7 The Appellant had preferred a Criminal Revision No. 612/2004 against the Judgment/Final Order dt. 18.11.2004 before the High Court, which has been dismissed vide Impugned Judgement and Final Order dt. 14.11.2018. The High Court within its powers of revision, upheld the conviction of the Appellant under Section 498A of IPC and Section 4 of the D.P. Act, 1961 with the observation that there was no error of law or perversity in the orders passed by the lower courts. The said portion is reproduced as under:

“I have perused the judgment and orders dated 18.112004 and 28.08.2004, passed by learned courts below. The learned courts below have considered all aspects of the matter in detail and I do not find any error of law or perversity in the aforesaid impugned judgment and orders. The instant revision lacks merit, and deserves to be dismissed.” 3.8 Further, vide Order dt. 28.11.2018, passed by the High Court, the Application seeking recall of the Impugned Order dt.14.11.2018 was also rejected at the threshold, as being misconceived in law.
4. It has been vehemently argued by the learned Counsel for the Appellant that the Impugned Judgment dt. 14.11.2018 passed by the High Court, suffers from non-application of mind, and non-
consideration of the merits of the case. Learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the allegations under Section 498A IPC and Section 4 of the D.P. Act, 1961, were unsustainable qua the Appellant, as there is no independent evidence on behalf of the prosecution, and the entire case hinges upon the deposition of the father of the Complainant and Complainant herself. It was argued that the Complainant who cohabited with the Appellant only for a period of about a year, had made bald allegations without any specifics of date, time or event, in the FIR in Case Crime No. 60/1999, which has only been registered as a counter-blast to the Divorce Petition preferred by the Appellant. It is brought to our notice that the divorce decree in lieu of their marriage, has already been passed, and the same has never been challenged by the Complainant, and hence has attained finality.

5. It has also been urged by the learned Counsel for the Appellant, that the High Court passed the Impugned Order in absence of representation of a Counsel on behalf of the Appellant, which is not permissible. Learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that in the absence of a Counsel for the Appellant, the High Court could have appointed an amicus-curiae to represent the case of the Appellant, rather than passing an adversarial order against him.

6. On the other hand, it has been argued on behalf of the State that to establish cruelty within the threshold of Section 498A, the evidence of the relatives of the Complainant wife cannot be brushed aside. The deposition of the father of the Complainant does establish that the Complainant was time and again harassed, and beaten her up for not bringing enough dowry. Reliance was placed on Bhagwan Jagannath Markad v. State of Maharashtra1, Arun Vyas & Anr. v. Anita Vyas2, Surendran v. State of Kerala3.

7. Having heard the learned counsel for the respective parties and having perused the record, the question remains whether the High Court vide Impugned Order dt. 14.11.2018 whilst exercising its revisionary jurisdiction, was correct in upholding the conviction of the Appellant under Section 498A IPC & Section 4 D.P. Act, 1961. In that respect, it is prudent to examine the statutory provisions, which are as under:

“498A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty.— Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine. Explanation.— For the purpose of this section, “cruelty” means— (a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or (b) (2016) 10 SCC 537 (1999) 4 SCC 690 (2022) 15 SCC 273  harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.”
3. Penalty for giving or taking dowry.— (1) If any person, after the commencement of this Act, gives or takes or abets the giving or taking of dowry, he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than five years, and with fine which shall not be less than fifteen thousand rupees or the amount of the value of such dowry, whichever is more. Provided that the Court may, for adequate and special reasons to be recorded in the judgment, impose a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than five years. (2) Nothing in sub-
4. Penalty for demanding dowry.—If any person demands, directly or indirectly, from the parents or other relatives or guardian of a bride or bridegroom, as the case may be, any dowry, he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months, but which may extend to two years and with fine which may extend to ten thousand rupees: Provided that the Court may, for adequate and special reasons to be mentioned in the judgment, impose a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than six months.”

9. In the present case, the allegations made by the Complainant are vague, omnibus and bereft of any material particulars to substantiate this threshold. Apart from claiming that Appellant husband harassed her for want of dowry, the Complainant has not given any specific details or described any particular instance of harassment. The allegations in the FIR, and the depositions of the prosecution witnesses suggest that on multiple occasions, the Complainant wife was ousted from the matrimonial house, and kicked and punched in the presence of her father, PW-2 herein and she was repeatedly tormented with dowry demands, and when she was unable to honor them, the Appellant and her family physically beat her up; whereas she has not mentioned the time, date, place, or manner in which the alleged harassment occurred. It is alleged that the Complainant suffered a miscarriage, as she fell down, when the Appellant and her family who pushed her out of the house; however, no medical document from any medical institution or hospital or nursery was produced to substantiate the allegations.

10. Upon carefully considering the record, we find that apart from the statements of PW-1 and PW-2, there is no evidence to substantiate the allegations of harassment and acts of cruelty within the scope of Section 498A of IPC, and Section 4 of the D.P. Act, 1961. For this reason, we find merit in the submission of the learned Counsel for the Appellant, and are of the considered view that there is no material on record to establish the allegations of hurt or miscarriage, and of hurt and criminal intimidation in terms of Section 323 r/w 34 and Section 506 IPC respectively. The Trial Court has rightly held that evidence of the Complainant is the only strong evidence that she sustained injuries on various parts of her body due to the physical assault by the accused persons, and that there was no medical examination conducted by the Complainant, so as to prove that the miscarriage was a consequence of the physical assault.

11. The Trial Court has indeed applied its judicial mind to the material on record whilst acquitting the Appellant and the co- accused parents-in-law for offences under Section 323 r/w 34 & Section 506 IPC. However, it appears that the Trial Court had passed the order of conviction of the Appellant under Section 498A IPC & Section 4 of the D.P. Act, 1961, merely on the possibility that the allegations and the depositions of the PW-1 corroborated by PW2, are true and correct. Although one cannot deny the emotional or mental torture that the Complainant may have undergone in the marriage, however a cursory or plausible view cannot be conclusive proof to determine the guilt of an individual under Section 498A & Section 4 of the D.P. Act, 1961, especially to obviate malicious criminal prosecution of family members in matrimonial disputes. In this respect, we also cannot ignore that the FIR dt. 20.12.1999 was registered after the Appellant had filed the Divorce Petition under Section 13 of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 on 06.02.1999. In consideration thereof and that the Complainant had cohabited with the Appellant only for a period of about a year, it appears that the FIR registered by the Complainant was not genuine.

14. The term “cruelty” is subject to rather cruel misuse by the parties, and cannot be established simpliciter without specific instances, to say the least. The tendency of roping these sections, without mentioning any specific dates, time or incident, weakens the case of the prosecutions, and casts serious suspicion on the viability of the version of a Complainant. We cannot ignore the missing specifics in a criminal complaint, which is the premise of invoking criminal machinery of the State. Be that as it may, we are informed that the marriage of the Appellant has already been dissolved and the divorce decree has attained finality, hence any further prosecution of the Appellant will only tantamount to an abuse of process of law.

15. We accordingly allow the Appeals and the Order dt.14.11.2018 passed by the High Court of Allahabad in Criminal Revision No. 612/2004 convicting the Appellant under Section 498A of IPC & Section 4 of D.P. Act, 1961, is set aside and the Appellant is acquitted of all the charges.

16. Pending application(s), if any, stands disposed of."

On this she asked them specifically as to what else they want, on which they told her that they want the marriage to be solemnized of minimum of Rs.50 lakh on which for marriage was to be solemnized on 10.12.2017 in hotel Ramada Plaza, a 5 star hotel, which was booked and Rs. 50,000/- was given as booking amount.

15. The present two petitions under Section 482 Cr.P.C. have thus been filed before this Court challenging the proceedings of the said case with the prayers as aforesaid by the respective accused persons.

16. Learned counsel for the applicants submitted that the applicants have been falsely implicated in the present case. It is submitted that falsity of the present case is itself evident from the fact that 02 accused named in the F.I.R. namely Smt. Pooja Batla/nand and Rajat Batla have been exonerated by the police as during investigation their implication was not found in the matter. It is further submitted that even the allegation against the accused/Piyush Kaushal for the offence under Section 377 I.P.C. was found to be incorrect and as such he was exonerated under the said section after investigation. It is submitted that the First Information Report has been lodged on 26.07.2019 which is after an inordinate delay of about 05 months. It is submitted that marriage of the applicant/Piyush Kaushal was solemnized with Paru the daughter of the opposite party no. 2 and the ceremony was simple ceremony in an ideal manner without any demand of dowry. It is submitted that soon after marriage Paru along with her spouse went to United Kingdom (London) where they were working. It is submitted that since Paru had left her husband's place and was being contacted by the husband through WhatsApp chats and there being no response from her demonstrated that she does not want to live with him and thus Piyush Kaushal filed a divorce case in United Kingdom (London). It is further submitted that the applicant/Piyush Kaushal is an educated and a well-qualified person and because of some misunderstanding between him and his wife/Paru matrimonial dispute arose which has taken the shape of criminal case in the nature of F.I.R. with totally false and baseless allegations.

It is submitted that the applicant Surendra Kumar is an old persons aged about 79 years whereas the other applicant Smt. Usha is also an old persons aged about 69 years and they are suffering from various diseases. Learned counsel has submitted that the court taking cognizance upon the charge sheet has not applied its judicial mind and has taken cognizance and passed the summoning order dated 19.12.2019 on a printed proforma which has blanks in it which were filled by pen. It is submitted that the court concerned has not assigned any reason for passing the said order. It is submitted that the allegations against the applicants of demanding dowry is false and baseless. It is submitted that the order summoning and the proceedings are bad in the eyes of law and deserve to be quashed. It is submitted that vagueness of the allegations in the matter are apparent as there are no specific dates of the alleged incident mentioned in the same. There are general and roving allegations against the accused persons. It is submitted that as such the proceedings against the applicants be quashed.

17. Learned counsel for the opposite party no. 2 and learned State counsel vehemently opposed the petitions and the prayer for quashing and submitted that the applicants are named in the F.I.R. and there are allegations against them.

Ref: Criminal Misc. Application U/S 482 No. 18261 of 2022 and Criminal Misc. Application U/S 482 No. 36143 of 2022

18. These two (02) above petitions under Section 482 Cr.P.C. relate to challenge of the proceedings initiated by Smt. Paru Taneja, under Section 12 of The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 for offences under Sections 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, Police Station- Sahibabad, District Ghaziabad. The applicants in Application U/S 482 No. 18261 of 2022 are Smt. Usha/mother-in-law, Surindar Kaushal/father-in-law, Pooja Batla/nand and Rajat Batla/nandoi of the opposite party no. 2. The applicant in other petition being Application U/S 482 No. 36143 of 2022 is Piyush Kaushal the husband of the opposite party no. 2 Smt. Paru Taneja.

19. The facts of the case are that the opposite party no. 2 filed a complaint dated 12.11.2021 against 05 accused persons namely Piyush Kaushal (husband), Smt. Usha (mother-in-law), Surendra Kumar (father-in-law), Smt. Pooja Batla (nand) and Rajat Batla (nandoi) with the allegation that she was married to the opposite party no. 1 Piyush Kaushal therein on 18.4.2018 as per Hindu rites and rituals and marriage was performed in Panchkula, Haryana. Approximately Rs. 50 lakh was spent in the wedding and ornaments of gold, silver and diamond along with costly clothes, furnitures, household items and cash money were given in it. She after marriage and vidai, went to the house of the accused/respondents and handed over the entire jewellery to the respondents which are in their possession till date. She started discharging her marital obligations and tried to fulfil their expectations. At the time of marriage her husband was working in London due to which the accused persons used to taunt that dowry and gifts have not been given as per their status. Her husband went to London (U.K.) on 02.5.2018 but she could not go with him as he was not having Visa. Thereafter she went there on 22.05.2018. She started discharging her marital obligations. The accused/respondent used to assault her regularly and taunt her for less dowry and used to tell her to bring Rs. 25 lakh from your parents for purchase of house else he would murder her. The respondent is a clever man. The respondent often used to be intoxicated and when she asked reason for coming at late hours, he used to assault her. After about one week of her marriage her mother-in-law, father-in-law, nand and nandoi started assaulting her for less dowry. She continued facing it but the accused persons did not mend their ways. From 02.02.2019 she and her husband are living separately without any physical relationship. Her husband in an intoxicated condition used to assault her and torture her physically and mentally and due to dispute in the relations, her mother lodged a case as Case Crime No. 0140/2019, State vs. Piyush Kaushal and others, under Sections 498A, 377, 406, 506 I.P.C. and ¾ D.P. Act. The respondent is working in London in Amazon Company at a good position and is getting Rs. 10 lakh per month as salary and is also having a lot of property. The prayers in the complaint are thus under Section 18 of the Act for an order protecting her from further domestic violence and return of ""Streedhan"" being vehicle, jewellery, clothes etc., under Sections 17 and 19 for providing safe place to live for which rent of Rs. 15,000/- per month be ordered to be given, under Section 20 of the Act for Rs. 5,00,000/- per month as her maintenance and under Section 22 of the Act for one time alimony of Rs. 1 crore. Further it was prayed that entire ""Streedhan"" be directed to be returned to her.

21. Learned counsel for the applicants submitted that the applicants have been falsely implicated in the present case. It is submitted that entire story in the complaint is concocted, false and an attempt to misuse the procedure of law. It is submitted that the applicant/Pooja Batla and Rajat Batla are permanent residents of London (United Kingdom) and have no concern with life and living of the complainant and her husband. It is submitted that the said persons do not share the household with any of the other persons and particularly with the complainant and her husband. It is submitted while placing para no. 26 and 27 of the affidavits in both the said petitions, that the complainant/opposite party no. 2 and her husband/Piyush Kaushal lived for around 03 days only in the house of the applicant no. 1/Smt. Usha and the applicant no. 2/Surindar Kaushal and thereafter, they went for honeymoon from 22.4.2018 to 24.04.2018 and then to the house of the parents of opposite party no. 2 from 26.4.2018 to 27.4.2018 and then both of them returned back and stayed from 27.4.2018 to 01.5.2018 at the house of the applicant no. 1 and the applicant no. 2. It is submitted that the husband went to London on 2.5.2018 and the opposite party no. 2 went to Delhi Airport to drop her husband but did not return to the house of the applicant no. 1 and the applicant no. 2 but stayed back at the house of her parents at Sahibabad, Ghaziabad and while staying at the said place, she gave her interview for U.K. Visa on 14.5.2018 and then came back to the house of the applicant no. 1 and the applicant no. 2 and had again returned back on 17.5.2018 at Sahibabad, Ghaziabad to collect her visa and subsequently after collecting her Visa on 22.5.2018, she left for London to live with her husband on 24.05.2018. It is further submitted that from 16.07.2018 to 24.7.2018 the opposite party no. 2 and her husband went to Croatia and thereafter from 26.09.2018 to 01.10.2018 they went to Rome, Italy and to Venice, Italy from 12.10.2018 to 15.10.2018 and all the expenses were borne solely by her husband. It is submitted that the opposite party no. 2 left the house of her husband at London without informing him on 18.12.2018 after which on intervention of some family members they convinced his wife to live with him again who then returned back on 21.12.2018 and started living with him in London. Subsequently on 26.12.2018 the opposite party no. 2 packed her all the articles and forced her husband to drop her to airport as she wanted to leave for India, but surprisingly on 15.1.2019 she without informing her husband, reached back to home at London. It is submitted that the marriage was a love marriage as the opposite party no. 2 and Piyush Kaushal used to study together in the year 2015 and in the year 2016 and they decided to get married and Roka Ceremony took place in October 2017, after which some issues arose between the family which were later on resolved and then they married each other. It is further submitted that the opposite party no. 2 is a highly educated woman and has worked at various high posts, the details of the same have been given in para-42 of the affidavit which are as under:-

""(a) 2012-2015 working with a multi national firm Price Water House Coopers in Dubai, UAE in a Senior Executive Position.
(b) 2016-2017 working with a top e-commerce company Flipkart in Bangalore, India as Senior Manager earning more than 25 lakh annually.
(c) 2018-2021 working in London, UK as Associate Director E-commerce, Omnicom Media Group 90-100 Southwark Street, London SE1 OSW. (d) 2021- Current date working in Dubai as Director E-Commerce Strategy, Omnicom Media Group at Omnicom Media Group Building, Dubai Media City, United Arab Emirates-34404.""
It is submitted that the present complaint has been filed by the opposite party no. 2 just in order to harass and falsely implicate the applicants. Learned counsel for the applicants further submitted that the opposite party no. 2 earlier had filed a divorce petition before the Principal Judge, Family Court, Panchkula, Haryana on 11.10.2021 which was dismissed on 22.11.2021 on the ground of territorial jurisdiction. Subsequently the husband/Piyush Kaushal filed a divorce petition under Section 13 of Hindu Marriage Act on 23.11.2021 before the Principal Judge, Family Court, Derabassi, Punjab and in the meantime, the present complaint has been filed at a belated stage on 12.11.2021 for an incident alleged to have taken place in the year 2018-19. It is further submitted that the allegations in the complaint as narrated are general and omnibus. It is submitted that although the family members of the husband are made accused/respondents in it but the version of the complaint does not show that they were sharing the same house-hold with the complainant and her husband. It is submitted that in the absence of specific and clear allegations against the respondent, the filing of the complaint is clearly an act of malafide which would also lack the necessary pleadings, averments and allegations for the Court concerned to proceed. It is thus submitted that the present petition be allowed and the proceedings of the said case be also quashed.

22. Learned counsel for the opposite party no. 2 and learned counsel for the State opposed the prayers for quashing and submitted the applicants are named in the complaint and there are allegations against them. The present petitions be thus dismissed.

23. After having heard learned counsels for the parties and perusing the records, it is evident that the dispute in the present matter has arisen after Piyush Kaushal entered into a matrimonial relationship with Paru. The relationship became sour and as such an F.I.R. was lodged initially on 26.7.2019 under Sections 498A, 377, 406, 506 I.P.C. and ¾ D.P. Act against 05 accused persons. The investigation in the matter concluded and out of 05 named accused persons in the F.I.R. implication of two accused persons namely Smt. Pooja Batla and Rajat Batla was found to be false and they were not charge sheeted and further the allegations with regard to Section 377 I.P.C. against the accused/Piyush Kaushal was also found to be false and thus he was exonerated for the same. Charge sheet was then submitted against three accused persons namely Piyush Kaushal (husband), Smt. Usha (mother-in-law) and Surendra Kumar (father-in-law), under Sections 498A, 406, 506 I.P.C. and ¾ D.P. Act. The court concerned vide its order dated 19.12.2019 took cognizance upon the same and summoned the accused persons therein.

40. In the present case, leaving aside there being no reasons in support of the order of the issuance of process, as a matter of fact, it is clear from the order of the learned Single Judge of the High Court, that there was no such order passed at all. The learned Single Judge of the High Court, based on the record, has presumed that there was an order of issuance of process. We find that such an approach is unsustainable in law. The appeal therefore deserves to be allowed.""

26. Further the other limb of the matter is with regards to the allegation against the accused person named in the F.I.R. Piyush Kaushal. Although he is the husband of the daughter of the first informant/opposite party no. 2 against whom there were specific allegation with regard to having unnatural sex with the victim but after investigation the said allegation was found to be false and as such he was exonerated for offence under Section 377 I.P.C.

27. The other allegations in the matter for all the accused persons including the husband are general and omnibus. In so far as 02 of the named accused in the F.I.R. namely Smt. Pooja Batla (nand) and Rajat Batla (nandoi) are concerned, their implication was found to be false in the matter and thus they were not charge sheeted by the Investigating Agency. The allegation thus for them was found to be false. The allegation against the remaining 03 accused persons the same as that of the other two not-charge sheeted accused and are general and omnibus. The 02 accused named in the F.I.R. and the charge sheeted apart from the husband are Surendra Kumar the father-in-law and Smt. Usha the mother-in-law of Paru. Even with regards to them the allegations are general and omnibus.

10. In such circumstances, normally against a person who is not falling under any of the aforesaid categories when allegations are raised, in the light of the observations made in Preeti Gupta's case (supra), the Court concerned owes an irrecusable duty to see whether such implication is over implication and/or whether the allegations against such a person is an exaggerated version. We have already taken note of the fact that except the observation made in paragraph 7 there is no consideration at all of the contentions of accused No. 5 in the impugned order.

x x x (7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.""

Provided that the Court may, for adequate and special reasons to be recorded in the judgment, impose a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than five years.

(a) presents which are given at the time of a marriage to the bride without any demand having been made in that behalf:

Provided that such presents are entered in a list maintained in accordance with the rules made under this Act;
(b) presents which are given at the time of a marriage to the bridegroom without any demand having been made in that behalf:
Provided that such presents are entered in a list maintained in accordance with the rules made under this Act:
Provided further that where such presents are made by or on behalf of the bride or any person related to the bride, such presents are of a customary nature and the value thereof is not excessive having regard to the financial status of the person by whom, or on whose behalf, such presents are given.
4. Penalty for demanding dowry.-- If any person demands, directly or indirectly, from the parents or other relatives or guardian of a bride or bridegroom, as the case may be, any dowry, he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months, but which may extend to two years and with fine which may extend to ten thousand rupees:
Provided that the Court may, for adequate and special reasons to be mentioned in the judgment, impose a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than six months.""

25. A mere reference to the names of family members in a criminal case arising out of a matrimonial dispute, without specific allegations indicating their active involvement should be nipped in the bud. It is a well-recognised fact, borne out of judicial experience, that there is often a tendency to implicate all the members of the husband's family when domestic disputes arise out of a matrimonial discord. Such generalised and sweeping accusations unsupported by concrete evidence or particularised allegations cannot form the basis for criminal prosecution. Courts must exercise caution in such cases to prevent misuse of legal provisions and the legal process and avoid unnecessary harassment of innocent family members. In the present case, appellant Nos. 2 to 6, who are the members of the family of appellant No. 1 have been living in different cities and have not resided in the matrimonial house of appellant No. 1 and respondent No. 2 herein. Hence, they cannot be dragged into criminal prosecution and the same would be an abuse of the process of the law in the absence of specific allegations made against each of them.

28. The inclusion of Section 498A of the IPC by way of an amendment was intended to curb cruelty inflicted on a woman by her husband and his family, ensuring swift intervention by the State. However, in recent years, as there have been a notable rise in matrimonial disputes across the country, accompanied by growing discord and tension within the institution of marriage, consequently, there has been a growing tendency to misuse provisions like Section 498A of the IPC as a tool for unleashing personal vendetta against the husband and his family by a wife. Making vague and generalised allegations during matrimonial conflicts, if not scrutinized, will lead to the misuse of legal processes and an encouragement for use of arm twisting tactics by a wife and/or her family. Sometimes, recourse is taken to invoke Section 498A of the IPC against the husband and his family in order to seek compliance with the unreasonable demands of a wife. Consequently, this Court has, time and again, cautioned against prosecuting the husband and his family in the absence of a clear prima facie case against them.

29. We are not, for a moment, stating that any woman who has suffered cruelty in terms of what has been contemplated under Section 498A of the IPC should remain silent and forbear herself from making a complaint or initiating any criminal proceeding. That is not the intention of our aforesaid observations but we should not encourage a case like as in the present one, where as a counterblast to the petition for dissolution of marriage sought by the first appellant-husband of the second respondent herein, a complaint under Section 498A of the IPC is lodged by the latter. In fact, the insertion of the said provision is meant mainly for the protection of a woman who is subjected to cruelty in the matrimonial home primarily due to an unlawful demand for any property or valuable security in the form of dowry. However, sometimes it is misused as in the present case.

30. In view of the discussions as above, this Court comes to the conclusion that summoning order, at the first instance, is a non-speaking order which is on a typed proforma, in which gaps have been filled with pen. The court concerned has not given any reason for reaching to a conclusion that the accused persons need to be summoned. The allegations against the accused Piyush Kaushal for the offence under Section 377 I.P.C. has been found to be false and he has been exonerated for the said offence. Two co-accused namely Smt. Pooja Batla and Rajat Batla named in the F.I.R. and assigned common and general role as that of the other co-accused persons, have been exonerated of the charges levelled against them. The allegations in the matter are general and omnibus. The husband, his parents and sister and her husband were made as accused in the F.I.R. The F.I.R. has been lodged with an inordinate delay of about 05 months.

31. Even an important aspect which emerges out from the records is that the husband (an accused) and wife (victim) are well educated and well placed persons. The dispute between them is purely matrimonial in nature. The victim does not state of any bodily injuries to her and neither is there any document to show any bodily injury. She has travelled various times to foreign country. Even the couple have together travelled to various foreign places. The facts thus appear to be a clash of ego between them which could not subside but carried on for a long time which then resulted in lodging of F.I.R. and even a complaint under the Domestic Violence Act.

32. Looking to the facts of the case, law on the dispute, nature of allegations and the relationship of the accused persons as per the F.I.R., the present cases are fit cases which deserve to be quashed. Hence, Criminal Misc. Application U/S 482 No. 4446 of 2020 and Criminal Misc. Application U/S 482 No. 2818 of 2020 are allowed and the proceeding against the applicants/accused therein are quashed.

33. In so far as the proceedings under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act are concerned, the allegations in the matter are for violence alleged to have taken place in the years 2018-2019 which is after a period of about more than 02 years. The complainant carries multiple prayers which even prays for return of ""Streedhan"". The reading of the complaint goes to show that although the complainant was alleged to have been assaulted and beaten by her husband, but there is no supporting documents to show any kind of injury received by her. The allegations in the complaint are general and omnibus. The husband, father-in-law, mother-in-law, nand and nandoi are respondents therein. A perusal of the allegations go to show that there has been matrimonial dispute. The fact that marriage was a love marriage is not disputed. The fact that the complainant is a well-educated and qualified person having worked in various companies of international fame is also not under dispute. The allegations being general and omnibus in nature go to show that the complaint has been filed only with an intention to implicate the maximum number of family members for obvious reasons. Thus Criminal Misc. Application U/S 482 No. 18261 of 2022 and Criminal Misc. Application U/S 482 No. 36143 of 2022 also deserve to be allowed and the proceedings therein against the applicants as prayed for deserve to be quashed. As such, the said two petitions are also allowed and the proceedings against the applicants therein are also quashed.

With the consent of learned counsel appearing for the parties, the case is being heard and decided finally without calling counter affidavit.

3. Learned counsel for the applicants placed brief facts of the case, that on the basis of an order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Hapur on an application moved before the Chief Judicial Magistrate under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., a First Information Report3 was lodged on 16.03.2024 at 06:49 hrs. against the father-in-law Virendra Singh (applicant no. 1), mother-in-law Meenakshi Singh (applicant no. 2), Nanad Swati Singh (applicant no. 3) and Arjun Singh husband of the informant, stating that the informant is a law abiding and trustworthy woman, presently residing in Hapur and her permanent address is of Madhya Pradesh. She has detailed about the accused persons named in the FIR showing her relation with them. Informant's version in the FIR is that her marriage was solemnized with accused Arjun Singh on 25.06.2023 in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh. Thereafter, the marriage was registered before the Registrar, Marriages, Sadar-1, Hapur on 27.06.2023 through an application no. 202314100302. Said marriage was mediated by Sri Umesh Singh Chauhan +91-8770894052, resident of Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, wherein informant's husband Arjun Singh, aged about 34 years, was stated to be the resident of Toronto, Canada (425-221 Balliol Street, M4S1C8, Toronto) and it was also informed that Arjun Singh is the citizen of Canada and previously he had not performed any marriage. Copy of Canadian Passport No. A1887019 of Arjun Singh has been enclosed.

3.1 It is further stated in the FIR that 'Roka'/ engagement ceremony of the informant and Arjun Singh was performed on 11.12.2022, wherein informant's father gifted a gold chain (3.5 tola) to her husband, Rs. 11,000/- each to father-in-law and mother-in-law and Rs. 3100/- each to Nanad and her husband. After the engagement ceremony, Arjun Singh went back to Canada and no date of marriage was decided as it had to be fixed as per return schedule of Arjun Singh from Canada. After some time, marriage was slated for 25.06.2023. The informant, in the FIR, further alleges that while the marriage arrangements had been done by her father, her father-in-law called her father asking to spend at least Rs. 1 Crore in the marriage ceremony and specified the guests to whom cash envelops or gifts were to be presented, including the booking of hotel and other arrangements. While the informant's father raised objection over the demands stepped up by her father-in-law, he spoke that his son is a Canadian citizen and a number of persons are willing to spend Rs. 4 to 5 crore in the marriage. Under such compulsion, her father had to ensure the arrangements of marriage.

3.2 As per the FIR, the marriage was solemnized in Meghdoot Resort, Ujjain, wherein about Rs. 55 lakh were spent and ornaments of Rs. 8 lakh were also given by her father. Informant's father also gave her, gold and silver ornaments to the worth of Rs. 95 lakh. After vidaai she came to Hapur in the night at about 12 O'clock on 26.06.2023. The next morning to change her dress, when she tried to find the bag wherein the gold and silver ornaments gifted by her father and the ornaments given to her by her in-laws were kept, it was not there. On being asked about the said bag, her in-laws informed that all the valuables are in their custody and have been kept at safe place because of marriage in the family.

3.3 Further allegations in the FIR are that on 28.6.2023, after marriage reception which was staged in Surya Hotel, New Friends Colony, Delhi, they went to London on 01.07.2023. They lived there for about a month, where Arjun Singh forcefully did unnatural sex and sans condom stating that man's purpose is to spread his genes and he does not believe in using protection. Other than this, he got 10,000 pounds spent from her. The informant came to know that her husband is atheistic and eats beef despite belonging to Hindu religion. The informant realized changes in her husband's behaviour and noticed that he never left his mobile and use to send messages and had frequent conversations with someone.

3.4 The informant next alleges that she came back to India from London on 30.07.2023 while her husband went to Canada. The informant found out through the location shared to her by her husband, that her husband instead of living in his house, used to live at another address in the nearby building. On being inquired through her sources, the informant came to know that Arjun Singh has been residing with a woman, namely, Alfiya Shaheed Hasan, resident of 265 Balliol Street, M4S1C9 Toronto for the last 13 years in a house as husband and wife. Surprisingly, her father-in-law and mother-in-law were also well aware of the fact. Knowing about the said situation, on being asked by family, Arjun Singh came to India on 16.12.2023, whereafter some family members of both sides including the accused persons had some conversation, wherein Arjun Singh, his father and mother accepted about Arjun's relationship with Alfiya Shaheed Hasan for last 18 years, however, in-laws of the informant asked her to excuse them and start a new life with Arjun Singh, however, Arjun Singh conspicuously said that he cannot separate from Alfiya and the informant may go with him to Canada if she wants to live as his second wife. Hearing the said words, the informant, her parents and uncle (Taau) were astonished, however, her father-in-law and mother-law did not utter a word, which revealed that they were already knowing about the illicit relationship of their son.

3.5 Informant also alleged that while she started to pack her luggage to go with her parents from in-law's place, her husband, father-in-law and mother-in-law unitedly stopped her from carrying any article and even the informant was restrained from taking any personal belongings. It is further alleged that the accused persons are exerting pressure upon the informant asking her to live with the existing scenario and even Alfiya Shaheed Hasan is also calling and messaging the informant from Canada, and asking to send Arjun Singh to Canada soon. Copy of text messages sent by Alfiya Shaheed Hasan are appended. Further allegations in the FIR are that the accused persons have played fraud with the informant and her parents in order to take dowry, and Rs. 1.20 crore along with ornaments have also been taken into possession including clothings, gifts etc. amounting to Rs. 14 lakh. Informant has brought on record the evidences with respect to the aforementioned averments.

3.6 In the FIR, the informant states that in respect to the abovementioned facts, she had made a complaint in Mahila Thana, Hapur on 07.01.2024 and to the Senior Superintendent of Police on 12.01.2024, for taking appropriate action against the accused persons, however, nothing has been done, thus, she moved an application before the Chief Judicial Magistrate for taking action against husband - Arjun Singh, father-in-law - Virendra Singh, mother-in-law Meenakshi Singh and sister-in-law Swati Singh for illegal possession of Rs. 1.20 crore, criminal intimidation, dowry demand, for unnatural sex against husband, forgery and betrayal. She has suffered mentally and socially, thus, offence be registered under the relevant sections. Hence the present application. After moving the said application, on the order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, the FIR was lodged.

4. After investigation charge-sheet has been submitted against the accused persons and the applicants have been summoned by the order impugned dated 29.10.2024.

5. Learned Counsel for the parties have submitted their written submissions as permitted by this Court while the judgement was reserved. Same are taken on record.

6. Learned Counsel for the applicants submits that applicant nos. 1 & 2 are senior citizens (father in-law and mother-in-law of informant). Applicant No.3 is married sister-in-law and is residing in a different city, namely, Ghaziabad. They have been dragged into criminal proceedings stemming from a matrimonial discord between the informant (O.P. No.2) and her husband, Arjun Singh. Despite having no role, they are now facing proceedings under severe penal provisions, including Sections 498A, 307 IPC, 3/4 D.P. Act, etc. Only vague and general allegations are made against the entire family. Since husband is Canadian Citizen, the informant is harassing the family members of the husband.

6.1 In this continuous harassment, the informant has filed another FIR dated 29.11.2024 implicating the entire family under Section 406 IPC. In the said case, husband of Swati Singh (applicant no. 3) has also been implicated. Copy of said FIR has been brought on the record as Annexure No.SA-1 in second supplementary affidavit dated 16.03.2025.

6.2. Bringing the facts of the case before the Court, learned counsel for the applicants submits that on 28.11.2022, applicant No.3 Swati Singh was married to Atharva Sharma. To attend her marriage, husband of informant Arjun Singh was in India. On 11.12.2022, on the invitation of Umesh Singh Chauhan, a distant relative and neighbour of informant, applicants alongwith Arjun Singh (husband) went to Ujjain for the first meeting with the informant's family. Surprisingly the informant's family insisted for 'Roka' and performed the same despite unwillingness of applicants' family. On 25.06.2023, in a very hurried manner, the marriage was fixed. Applicants and others (total 40 persons) reached Ujjain on 24.06.2023 and came back on 26.06.2023 after marriage.

6.4 On 01.07.2023 the informant and husband went for honeymoon to London. On 31.07.2023 informant returned back to India as she was not having Canadian Visa, while her husband went back to Canada. In between 01.08.2023 to 22.12.2023, the informant remained in Hapur house only for 20 days and she used to fly frequently to Mumbai for undisclosed reasons. However, the family never objected.

6.5 On 16.12.2023 husband Arjun Singh came back to India and directly went to informant's house in Mumbai as informant was residing in Mumbai at that point of time. From there both went to Goa and on 20.12.2023 they came to Hapur from Goa. Then the applicants came to know that under the threat of informant, a tourist visa was also applied for the wife. This time, the informant was accompanied with 5 bodyguards.

6.6 On 22.12.2023, the informant left the in-laws' house permanently alongwith her parents and went to Mumbai. On 24.12.2023, the informant's husband went to Mumbai for solving the issues with her, however, it did not materialize. On 28.12.2023, Arjun Singh alone came back to his house in India and remained in Hapur till 18.01.2024. On 07.01.2024, first complaint was moved by the informant before the police, which was not registered. On 12.01.2024, she moved second complaint before the Senior Superintendent of Police, Hapur, that too was also not registered. Thereafter, on 23.01.2024 an application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. was filed.

6.7 Thereafter, pursuant to the order of the court concerned on the application filed by O.P. No. 2 under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., the first information report bearing Case Crime No. 191 of 2024 was lodged on 16.03.2024, under Sections 498A, 323, 377, 494, 420 IPC, and Section 3/4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, against the husband and his entire family including the applicants without any specific, direct, or credible allegation.

6.8 On 09.04.2024, medical examination was conducted in which no external injury was found and the informant refused for internal examination. On 09.04.2024, statements of the informant under Section 161 Cr.P.C. were recorded, in which she introduced another story against mother-in-law and married sister-in-law to make out offence under Section 307 IPC. On 12.04.2024, statements under Section 164 Cr.P.C. were recorded which contain no allegation under Section 307 IPC. The Investigating Officer4 has also recorded statements of other persons, i.e., the parents of informant who have also attempted to introduce the story of Section 307 IPC against applicant Nos. 2 & 3, only on the basis of hearsay evidence. On 20.04.2024, on the basis of available evidence, the I.O. expunged the name of Swati Singh and also expunged the alleged offence under Sections 377, 394 and 420 IPC and proceeded for investigation only against applicant Nos.1 and 2. and never added the offence under Section 307 IPC.

6.9 On the complaint of informant, the Investigating Officer was changed on 15.05.2024 and a new officer took over the charge of investigation. On 31.05.2024, the new Investigating Officer recorded the second statements of father of informant, mother of informant, mediator of marriage, namely, Umesh Singh Chauhan under Section 161 Cr.P.C. who have repeated the version of informant given under Section 161 Cr.P.C. No new evidence came on record. This Investigating Officer was transferred again. On 11.06.2024, again the third Investigating Officer, namely, Raghuraj Singh started the investigation and on the basis of evidence collected by Neeraj Kumar, as contained in Parcha No.10, added Section 307 IPC and also restored the offence under Sections 377, 394 and 420 IPC. Name of Swati Singh (applicant no. 3) was again added, (Parcha No.11). From 11.06.2024 till 19.08.2024, the investigating officer namely Raghuraj Singh has conducted the investigation and reduced the same from Parcha No. 11 to Parcha No. 19. He collected the below mentioned material:

i. Statement of Virendra Singh - applicant No.1 was recorded on 17.08.2024 who denied the charges.
ii. Statement of Meenakshi Singh - applicant No.2 was recorded on 17.08.2024 who denied the charges.
iii. Statement of Swati Singh - applicant No.3 was recorded on 17.08.2024 who denied the charges.
iv. Statement of Medical Officer was recorded on 17.08.2024 who denied the charges.
Thus, it is clear that no further evidence was collected in the investigation.
6.10 On 19.08.2024, the Investigation Officer on the basis of the available material submitted the charge sheet as detailed below:
1. Against applicant No.1 (Father-in-law) under Sections 498A, 323 IPC and 3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act.
2. Against applicant No.2 (Mother-in-law) under Sections 498A, 323, 307 IPC and 3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act.
3. Against applicant No.3 (married sister-in-law) under Sections 498A, 323, 307 IPC and 3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act.
6.11 However, the Circle Officer returned the charge sheet on 23.08.2024, raising specific issue that on what basis, Section 307 IPC was added and name of Swati Singh was included, which was already expunged. Said objection has been brought on record at Page 11 of supplementary affidavit dated 02.02.2025.
6.12 On 13.09.2024 pursuant to the aforesaid order of Circle Officer and since Raghuraj Singh, the earlier I.O., was transferred, the investigation was took over by new Investigating Officer on 13.09.2024. He conducted the investigation till 16.10.2024 which are contained in Parcha Nos. 20, 21 & 22. However, he did not collect any evidence. On 29.10.2024 without collecting any new evidence the same charge sheet dated 19.08.2024 was filed.
7. Learned counsel for the applicants has laid emphasis on the infirmities in evidences on record summarizing his submissions in the following manner:
7.1 The investigation process was tainted by inconsistency, arbitrariness, and bias. Repeated transfers of Investigating Officers created a fractured and inconsistent chain of investigation. No new evidence was gathered to justify the revival of dropped charges and improvements in statement is also evident.

7.2 The Circle Officer, Hapur clearly stated in its objection dated 23.08.2024, which has been brought on record as Annexure-12 to the petition that the chargesheet was filed without due diligence and without consideration of evidence. No explanation was offered for deviation from prior findings.

7.5 The Investigating Officers were frequently changed. I.O. - Anish Ahmad conducted a diligent probe and dropped severe charges, but successor I.O. Niraj Kumar added Sections 377 and 307 IPC without justification. I.O. Raghuraj Singh filed a charge-sheet despite clear objections of the Circle Officer dated 23.08.2024 regarding negligence.

8. Learned counsel for the applicants contends that a perusal of the evidence collected shows that no offence is made out against the applicants. He has framed his arguments on legal premises as follows:

A. Virendra Singh chargesheeted under Section 498A, 323 IPC & 3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act:
(i) There is no claim against Virendra Singh regarding any kind of demand of dowry rather the claim is only about the customary expenses and arrangements before marriage and of marriage i.e. Roka ceremony and wedding ceremony which are cultural practice and not any dowry demand. The ingredients required for invocation of Section 3/4 of Dowry Prohibition Act are absent.
(ii) Insofar as Section 498A is concerned, the essential ingredients are not made out as there is no averment pertaining to any 'cruelty' against Virendra Singh. No overt act is shown against Virendra Singh
(iii) Section 323 IPC is not made out as no allegation is in regard to causing any hurt resulting in bodily pain, disease or infirmity as provided in Section 319 IPC.
10. To strengthen his submissions learned counsel for the applicants has relied upon the following judgements of the Supreme Court:

A. State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal7:
Paragraph 108: ""Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.""
B. Sushil Kumar Sharma v. Union of India8:
Para 19: ""The object of the provision is prevention of the dowry menace. But as has been rightly contended by the petitioner, many instances have come to light where the complaints are not bona fide and have been filed with oblique motive. In such cases, the acquittal of the accused does not in all cases wipe out the ignominy suffered during and prior to trial. Sometimes adverse media coverage adds to the misery.""
C. Preeti Gupta v. State of Jharkhand9:
Para 30: ""It is a matter of common knowledge that exaggerated versions of the incident are reflected in a large number of complaints. The tendency of over-implication is also reflected in a very large number of cases.""
D. Geeta Mehrotra v. State of U.P.10 Para 20: Placing reliance upon paragraph-20 of the judgement of Supreme Court passed in Geeta Mehrotra (supra), learned counsel for the applicants submits that mere casual reference of the names of the family members in a matrimonial dispute without allegation of active involvement in the matter would not justify taking cognizance against them oblivious of the fact that they reside separately.""
E. Smt. Ruchi Tiwari v. State of U.P.11:
Para 15: ""In absence of specific allegations of demand of dowry made after marriage, and with no contemporaneous evidence, it cannot be said that a prima facie case under Sections 3/4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act is made out. Such general assertions do not satisfy the statutory requirements.""
F. Learned counsel for the applicants has also placed reliance on the judgements in the case of Kailash Chandra Agrawal vs. State of U.P. and others12 (Para 8-10); Pritam Ashok Sadafule vs. State of Maharashtra & others13, (Para 17 & 18); Varala Bharath Kumar vs. State of Telangana14 (Para 6-9); Kartik Chand Majee vs. State of Jharkhand & others15 (Para 9-11); Rajesh Sharma and others vs. State of U.P.16 (Para 14 & 15); K. Subbarao and others vs. State of Telangana17 (Para 5 to 8); Rashmi Chopra vs. State of U.P. and others18 (Para 24, 25, 27, 28 & 31) Seenivasan vs. State19 (Para 6-8); Kahkashan Kausar vs. State of Bihar20 (Para 10-18); Social Action Forum for Manav Adhikar and another vs. Union of India, Ministry of Law and Justice and others21, and Mohd. Akram Siddqui vs. State of Bihar and another22.
11. On the cumulative strength of the aforesaid submissions, it is submitted by learned counsel for the applicants that the proceedings of the criminal case pending against the applicants are liable to be quashed by this Court.

12. Learned counsel for O.P. No. 2 submits that the present applicants who are father-in-law, mother-in-law and sister-in-law, prior to the marriage have met with the informant and her family and have lured that Arjun Singh is unmarried and though being a Canadian citizen, he wants to marry an Indian Hindu girl, though it was well within their knowledge that he is already married with one Alfiya Shaheed Hasan in Canada.

12.1 The said misrepresentation by the applicants were made only to satisfy their thirst of dowry, which they knew that they will get if the informant agrees to marry, and also to gain social acceptance for their son in the society that their son is married to an Indian Hindu girl.

12.2 Learned counsel for O.P. No. 2 has placed forth the facts stating that 10 days' prior to marriage, applicant no.1 called the father of informant and asked to spend 1 Crore rupees in the marriage, thereafter marriage happened on 25.06.2023 at Meghdoot Resort, Ujjain in which 55 Lakhs were spent on arrangements and 95 Lakhs were spent on Jewellery.

12.3 After the informant came to know about the relation between the Alfiya and her husband, she confronted the applicants, but since they were already knowing it, they did nothing. On 22.12.2023 when the informant decided to leave her matrimonial house, the applicants denied to give any of her belongings. Prior to the marriage, the applicants were knowing that Arjun is married and settled in Canada and only in order to obtain dowry, the applicants through a conspiracy have cheated the informant.

12.4 Learned counsel for the O.P. No. 2 further contends that some relevant statements have not been annexed by the applicants while filing the present petition. He has drawn attention of the Court to Case Dairy Parcha No.10 dated 31.05.2024, statement of father of informant namely Ajay Huriya, mother Yogita Huriya and mediator Umesh Singh Chauhan whereby specific allegations have been raised against the applicant nos. 2 and 3 i.e. mother-in-law and sister-in-law, respectively, that they have tried to strangulate the informant and were demanding dowry from the informant and after which section 307 IPC was added by the investigating officer in the present case. The medical examination of the informant was conducted after the 110 days of the incident as the police did not bother to register the first information report of informant on time.

13. Legal premise, on which the learned counsel for O.P. No. 2 has advanced his submissions stating that the petition is devoid of merit are as follows:

13.1 The applicants only in order to get relief, has not approached this Court with clean hands, as 3 statements as contained in CD Parcha No.10 on basis of which the investigating officer of the present case has added Section 307 IPC against the applicant nos. 2 and 3 in the present case, have deliberately not been made part of present petition.
13.2 In the first information report apart from allegations as levelled against the absconding husband, namely, Arjun Singh, there are specific allegations against the applicants i.e father-in-law, mother-in-law and sister-in-law who are the main conspirators in the present case.
13.3 The applicants only in order to get dowry and gifts have cheated the informant and her family members, despite knowing the fact that their son Arjun Singh i.e. husband of informant is already married and settled in Canada. Through a premediated mind and by conspiring with each other, the applicants have first cheated her, then harassed the informant mentally and physically. Only because of money the applicants have ruined the life of the helpless informant who is a young lady, and now she is living on the mercy of her parents. Not only the husband but the applicants have also harassed the informant in order to fulfil their greed for the dowry 13.4 Perusal of statements of witnesses namely Sanjay Garg and Shailly Garg demonstrates that the witnesses are specifically stating that Alfiya is friend of Arjun Singh and they both have studied and working together, and as such the apprehension raised by the informant against her husband was not baseless rather based on concrete evidence.
13.5 The applicant nos. 1 & 2 have deliberately married their son Arjun Singh with the informant, only to get social acceptance here in India and to grab money in the form of dowry from the family of the informant. Statement of informant recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. specifically contains allegations against the applicants that after marriage when the informant demanded her jewellery, applicant no.2 pushed her and also on the pretext of dowry both sister-in-law and mother-in-law (applicant no.3 and 2) tried to strangulate the informant.
13.6 Statement of the informant recorded under Section 164 C.r.P.C. specifically raises allegations against the applicants that applicant no.1 was always demanding dowry from the father of informant, applicant no.2 misbehaved with informant when she complained about her husband, namely, Arjun Singh, also applicant nos. 2 and 3 were causing physical and mental harassment to the informant for bringing dowry less than their expectations. A perusal of statements of the informant, and her family members clearly demonstrate happening of cognizable offences and no benefit of the minor discrepancies in the statements of witnesses can be availed at this stage, as the appropriate forum to look after the factual aspects of the present case would be trial court.
13.7 The husband of informant namely Arjun Singh has absconded from India, against whom Look out Circular (LOC), Non-Bailable Warrants are issued by the trial court and there are high chances that the applicants would also escape from India as soon as they get relief from this Court. In the entire petition the applicants have failed to demonstrate that they have nothing to do with the husband of the informant, which itself proves their complicity in the present case.
13.8 Learned counsel for O.P. No. 2 further contends that from a perusal of the statements and material collected during investigation, a prima-facie case is made out against the applicants and the ground on which the applicants are seeking quashing of the present case cannot be seen herein through the present application filed under Section 528 of Bhartiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, inasmuch as there is remedy to file discharge application under Section 250 BNSS before the trial court. The Apex Court as well as this Court on numerous occasions have stated that while exercising the powers under the present jurisdiction i.e. 528 BNSS, formerly Section 482 Cr.P.C., this Court could not conduct mini trial.
13.9 After an exhaustive investigation, chargesheet has been filed against the applicants and as such it is only the trial court who can look at the evidence and try the applicants for the offences as alleged. This Court may not enter into the merits of the allegations as levelled by the prosecution, as it would amount to conduct a mini trial. Perusal of F.I.R. as well as statements of the witnesses, goes to show that, prima facie case for the alleged offence is made out against the applicants.
13.10 It is further contended by learned counsel for O.P. No. 2 that this Court cannot quash the entire criminal proceedings under the present jurisdiction Section i.e. Section 528 BNSS (formerly know as 482 Cr.P.C.) at the pre-trial stage, as held in the case of Mohd. Allauddin Khan vs. The State of Bihar & Others23, wherein the Apex Court has held that the High Court had no jurisdiction to appreciate the evidence of the proceedings under Section 482 Cr.P.C. because whether there are contradictions or/and inconsistencies in the statements of the witnesses is an essential issue relating to appreciation of evidence and the same can be gone into by the Judicial Magistrate during trial when the entire evidence is adduced by the parties. However, in the present case the said stage is yet to come.
13.11 Learned counsel appearing for O.P. No. 2 has further relied upon a judgement of the Apex Court in the matter of Rajeev Kaurav vs. Balasahab & Others24, wherein the it has been held that it is no more res integra that exercise of power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash a criminal proceeding is only when an allegation made in the F.I.R. or the charge sheet constitutes the ingredients of the offence/offences alleged. Interference by the High Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is to prevent the abuse of process of any law or Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. It is settled law that the evidence produced by the accused in his defence cannot be looked into by the Court, except in very exceptional circumstances.
14. Learned counsel for the O.P. No. 2 has relied upon the judgment of the Apex Court in case of Aluri Venkata Ramana vs. Aluri Thirupathi Rao & Ors.25, dated 12.12.2024, wherein the Apex Court has held thus:
""13. From the above ingredients reiterated by this Court, it is clear that an unlawful demand for dowry is not a prerequisite element to constitute ""cruelty under Section 498A IPC. It suffices that the conduct falls within either of the two broad categories outlined in clauses (a) or (b) of the provision, namely, wilful conduct likely to cause grave injury or mental harm (clause a), or harassment intended to coerce the woman or her family to meet any unlawful demand (clause b). Therefore, either form of cruelty. independent of a dowry demand, is sufficient to attract the provisions of Section 498A IPC and make the offence punishable under the law.""
16. Before this Court, the Respondents have contended that the wilful conduct described in clause (a) of the Explanation to Section 498A IPC should only be treated as cruelty if it is accompanied by a dowry demand as outlined in clause (b), or that an unlawful demand for property or valuable security, standing alone, constitutes cruelty under Section 498A. However, in light of the discussion above, it is evident that this submission is without merit and, therefore, is not accepted by this Court.""

25.6 Hence, in line with both the statutory language and the judicial pronouncements, this Court affirms that any form of property or valuable transfer associated with marriage, whether direct or indirect, express or implied, demanded or expected, and occurring at any point in time surrounding the marriage, constitutes dowry if the same is causally linked to the marriage transaction. Accordingly, the law must be enforced with sensitivity to the underlying coercive and oppressive practices that often masquerade as tradition or custom.

27. Coming to the facts of the present case, record shows that proceedings were initiated against the four named accused, including the applicants, through an application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., whereby FIR was registered alleging therein that the marriage of O.P. No. 2 was solemnized with Arjun Singh on 25.06.2023 at Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, where one Umesh Singh Chauhan acted as a mediator for the alliance. The said marriage was registered on 27.06.2023. It has further been stated that Arjun Singh is a Canadian, who is presently residing in Toronto, Canada.

27.1 As per the allegations, the Roka ceremony took place on 11.12.2022, during which details of the gifts, including jewellery, were shared. Following the ceremony, the groom returned to Canada on 18.12.2022 as the final date of the marriage had not been decided at that time. However, the date was later, fixed for 25.06.2023. It is alleged that approximately ten days prior to the wedding, the father-in-law of O.P. No. 2 contacted her father and conveyed certain expectations. He demanded that an amount of rupees one crore be spent on the marriage. Additionally, he made inquiries about the amount of money to be placed in envelopes for the relatives, the jewellery to be presented, and arrangements regarding hotel bookings and other related expenses. The father of O.P. No. 2 raised an objection to such demands made by the father-in-law. At the time it was stated that others were willing to spend Rs. 4 to 5 crores, as his son is a Canadian citizen. Under such pressure, he had no option but to go by the wishes and demands of father-in-law of O.P. No.2. As a result, an amount of Rs. 55 lakhs was spent on a resort in Ujjain. In addition, various other expensive gifts and jewellery were given as per expectations and desires of the in-laws. After the marriage, the bride arrived in Hapur on 26th June 2023, around 12:00 midnight. The following day, she noticed that one of her bags containing jewellery was missing. Upon asking her in-laws, she was informed that they had safely kept it with them. On 28th June 2023, a wedding reception was held at Surya Hotel, New Friends Colony, Delhi.

27.2 The newly married couple departed for London on 1st July 2023, where they stayed for a month. During their stay, her husband Arjun Singh, despite his wife's objections, engaged in physical relations with her and never used any form of contraception. In addition to the aforementioned issues, it has been claimed that her husband compelled her to spend 10,000 pounds. Furthermore, it is alleged that he does not believe in God and often speaks only of a single deity. Despite identifying as a Hindu, he consumes beef. The O.P. No. 2 noticed changes in her husband's temperament and attitude. He frequently used his mobile phone for messaging and speaking with someone, and he never used to leave it unattended. On July 30, 2023, O.P. No. 2 had to return alone from London to India, while her husband travelled to Canada.

27.4 Upon learning the truth, the husband was called to India on 16th December 2023. On 21st December 2023, the girl's parents along with her uncle and other relatives went to Hapur for the purpose of mediation. During this meeting, the boy and his parents admitted to having knowledge of his long-standing relationship with Alfiya. However, all of them expressed regret for the aforementioned events and requested a fresh start for the couple. They urged Arjun and Simran to reconcile and begin a new life together. However, Arjun flatly refused. He stated that he could not leave Alfiya, and shockingly, proposed that Simran may accept the role of his second wife if she wishes to accompany him to Canada. Simran's relatives were deeply shocked and disturbed upon hearing this. In contrast, Arjun's parents remained completely silent, making it evident that they were fully aware of their son's relationship with Alfiya. On December 22, 2023, when the opposite party no. 2 chose to reside with her parents, the in-laws, including the husband, did not allow her to take her clothing and other personal belongings.

27.5 Since the O.P. No. 2 returned from Canada, all the accused persons, including Alfiya, have been consistently pressurizing her to remain in the same environment, atmosphere, and circumstances. They have also been urging her to return to Canada as soon as possible. Alfiya has sent multiple messages reinforcing this stance. The applicants, including the husband of O.P. No. 2, had a premeditated plan and intent to demand dowry. They solemnized the marriage between Opposite Party No. 2 and Arjun Singh with the intention to deceive. Their motive was to cheat both the O.P. No. 2 and her parents, thereby fraudulently obtaining a sum of approximately Rs. 1.20 crore in cash, along with jewellery and other valuable gifts, which are still in the possession of the applicants. To substantiate the allegations, audio and video recordings, medical bills, and various other documents demonstrating the relationship between Arjun Singh and Alfiya have also been submitted. A list of items provided by both parties have been documented and duly placed on record. An application/complaint was initially submitted before the concerned authority in Mahila Thana, Hapur, on 7th January 2024, and subsequently before the SSP on 12th January 2024, requesting for appropriate action against the alleged accused individuals. However, when no action was taken, the complaint was subsequently sent through registered post and speed post for further consideration.

28.1 The Investigating Officer, based on the evidence collected during the course of the investigation, stated that no offence was found to have been committed under Sections 377, 494, and 420 of the Indian Penal Code43. It was further recorded that the allegations against Ms. Swati Singh were found to be baseless, and consequently, her name was exonerated from the case. However, the investigation continued against the husband, father-in-law, and mother-in-law under Sections 498A, 323, IPC and 3/4 D.P. Act, as well as relevant provisions of the Dowry Prohibition Act.

28.2 It appears that following the transfer investigation, the General Diary (G.D.) entry dated 31st May 2024 mentions the addition of Section 307 of the IPC. This inclusion is based on the evidence collected up to that date.

28.3 Simran underwent a medical examination on 9th April 2024, which revealed no external injuries on her body. Furthermore, she declined to undergo an internal medical examination.

29. Considering the submissions as made by learned counsel for the parties and after looking into records, it is admitted position that there are three main allegations, for which the present case has been lodged. Firstly, anticipation of lavish and exorbitant expenditure in wedding arrangements to reflect societal inclination towards opulent and grandeur. The matter, in so many words, has been equated with an unlawful solicitation of dowry. Secondly, the applicants, despite being aware of Arjun's relationship with Alfiya, failed to disclose the same and even then the marriage had been solemnized for the purpose of taking dowry. Thirdly, mental and physical harassment by the applicants for the purposes of dowry.

44. From the aforementioned decisions it is clear that the courts have expressed concern over the misuse of Section 498A IPC and the increase of tendency of implicating relatives of the husband in matrimonial disputes, without analysing the long-term ramifications of a trial on the informant as well as the accused. It would not be out of place to state that the Apex Court by way of its numerous judgements has warned the courts from proceeding against the relatives and in-laws of the husband when no prima facie case is made out against them

46. In the present case, this Court finds that there are major contradictions regarding the expenditure for preparation of marriage as raised by the in-laws, in the version of the FIR and the statements recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. Secondly, there is no whisper of any allegation that the father of the girl was ever threatened or coerced, either explicitly or implicitly, to fulfil the purported demands regarding gifts to relatives, selection of the marriage venue according to someone else's preference, or bearing the marriage expenses. Furthermore, there is no assertion that the marriage was ever threatened to be cancelled in the event of non-fulfilment of such demands. Therefore, it cannot be reasonably concluded that the applicants were in any manner involved in making a demand for dowry.

49. The allegations made, seem to be driven more by a desire for retribution than by any genuine grievance. The FIR fails to disclose any concrete or precise accusation against the family members of the husband. There is an absence of specific details, such as the time, place, or the manner in which the alleged harassment took place.

50. Furthermore, the informant has not mentioned any particular instance of harassment with clarity. The statements recorded under Sections 161 and 164 Cr.P.C. also show notable discrepancies when compared with the FIR. These inconsistencies further weaken the prosecution's case and indicate that the allegations may not be trustworthy or credible.

53. From the written submissions presented by the counsel for both parties, it is evident that the couple spent four days together in Goa, from 16.12.2023 to 20.12.2023 without any reported incident of harassment. No allegations against the applicants have been mentioned beyond this period, which ultimately led to the filing of the present case.

55. When accusations are levelled against the husband's family members, it is important to assess whether these allegations are genuine or merely vague, omnibus claims lacking specific details such as dates, times, or concrete incidents. Allegations that are general in nature and unsupported by clear evidence should be scrutinized carefully, particularly when there are inconsistencies between the FIR and the woman's subsequent statements.

56. In between the period i.e. 01.07.2023 to 30.07.2023, when the O.P. No. 2 was enjoying with her husband, for one month, she has not made any allegation with respect to the applicants, from which also it is clear that the case has been lodged for unnecessary harassment of the applicants who are family members of the husband.

57. The issue of flaw in the investigation has also been touched upon by learned counsel for the parties. In this regard, it has been submitted by learned counsel for the applicants that initially certain sections were excluded and the allegations against sister-in-law were found to be unsubstantiated. However, after the change of Investigating Officer, sections like Section 307 IPC were reintroduced in the charge-sheet despite absence of credible evidence.

60. As previously discussed, the inclusion of the sister-in-law's name as an accused in the charge-sheet, along with the addition of an offence under Section 307 IPC at the time of filing the charge-sheet, constitutes sufficient grounds to quash the charge-sheet as it reflects a flaw in the investigation.

61. Given the totality of the facts and circumstances, the judgements as relied upon, arguments of learned counsel for the parties including their written submissions and the settled position of law in matrimonial cases, this Court is of the considered opinion that the allegations as made against the family members of the husband, who are the applicants herein, are insufficient and, prima facie, do not make out a case against the applicants. Further, they are so farfetched and improbable that no prudent person can conclude that there are sufficient grounds to proceed against them. In effect, the case in hand falls squarely under the Categories (1), (5) and (7) set out in the case of State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal68, thus, it is a fit case to exercise inherent powers under Section 528 BNSS (482 Cr.P.C.). Accordingly, the order impugned dated 29.10.2024, up to the extent of summoning the applicant no.1 under Sections 498-A, 323 I.P.C. and Section 3/4 D.P. Act, and applicant nos. 2 and 3 under Sections 498-A, 323, 307 I.P.C. and Section 3/4 D.P. Act, charge sheet dated 19.08.2024 and proceeding of Case No.14793 of 202469, arising out of Case Crime No. 191 of 2024, Police Station- Hapur Nagar, District- Hapur, against the applicants, pending in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Hapur, are quashed.

62. Needless to say that this Court has not commented upon the husband, who is a Canadian Citizen and it is open for the O.P. No. 2 to proceed against him, if she thinks fit.

63. The present application stands allowed accordingly.

Brig Dinesh Khatri & Anr vs The State Govt Of Nct Of Delhi & Anr,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/141615853/,"Delhi High Court
Brig Dinesh Khatri & Anr vs The State Govt Of Nct Of Delhi & Anr on 28 June, 2025
1. The aforesaid two Writ Petitions have been filed on behalf of the Petitioners, who are father-in-law and mother-in-law of the Complainant/ Respondent No.2 Neha Khatri, under Article 226 of the Constitution of India read with Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash the Charge-Sheet filed against them in FIR No.154/2015 under Section 498A/323/504/506 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and Section 3 & 4 Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961Police Station Gautam Budh Nagar, U.P. as well as the Complaint Case No.1430/2016 under Sections 18/19/20/21/22 of Protection of Women against Domestic Violence Act, 2005 pending before the Court of learned M.M, Delhi.

2. The brief facts are that the Petitioner No.1 Brig. Dinesh Khatri, aged 67 years is an alumni of National Defence Academy, Pune. He is the second generation Army Officer and has served the Indian Army for about 35 years and got retired in February, 2007 from the prestigious rank of Brigadier. He is a Mechanical Engineer with Post graduation in Armament Engineering.

3. Petitioner No.2 Anita Khatri, aged 61 years is the wife of Petitioner No.1 Brig. Dinesh Khatri. She is a first Class M.Sc. in Home Science in Foods and Nutrition from M.S. University, Baroda, but chose to be a homemaker despite her academic credentials and qualifications. She is exemplary in performing her duties as wife, mother and a grandmother. Both the Petitioners are residing in Pune, Maharashtra.

4. The brief background of the case is that Ankur Khatri, aged 38 years is the son of the Petitioners and an Officer in the Merchant Navy for the last 16 years. He is a graduate of Nautical Sciences and has grown up in Army environment with great human qualities and values.

5. On 25.10.2007, Ankur Khatri got married to Respondent No.2 Neha according to Hindu customs and rites at Gautam Budh Nagar, U.P. After the marriage, the couple went for their honeymoon but after their return, the behaviour of Respondent No.2 was found to be very strange. She used to keep herself locked in the house and did not even try to communicate with her in-laws. The Petitioners supported her in her interest in books and Petitioner No.1 also got her a job as a School teacher so that she could enjoy what she likes.

6. Suddenly, the Respondent No.2 told the Petitioners about leaving her job and when they asked about the reason, she replied that the school staff was conspiring against her and putting drugs in her tea. The Petitioners felt that it was something more in the nature of a mental disorder.

7. On 30.08.2008, one son named Master Abeer was born to Respondent No.2 and their son, Ankur Khatri. It is claimed that during the entire period of her pregnancy, the Petitioner and their entire family took good care of Respondent No.2. They assumed that she was suffering from mental depression and disturbance on account of her pregnancy for which reason only, she has left her job. However, the actual reason was her bad behaviour for which the School Administration time and again gave warnings to her and finally removed her from the job and also asked him to pay a penalty or else they would file a case against her. The Petitioner No.1 tried his best to resolve the matter so as to protect the respect of Respondent No.2.

8. The Petitioners have submitted that the behaviour of Respondent No.2 was getting bad to worse day by day as she was becoming more aggressive and uncontrollable even against the child. Because of her such behaviour, they consulted many Doctors who consistently opined that the behaviour of Respondent No.2 was not normal and that she was in dire need of treatment. Therefore, the Respondent No.2 was regularly treated in Ruby Hall Hospital, Pune for the period from 2008 to 2014.

9. Ankur Khatri many a times, asked the parents of Respondent No.2 if she was suffering from mental disorder even before marriage, to which they always answered in negative. However, Respondent No.2 herself admitted that she had been taking the same medicines since before her marriage. The factum of the violent psychotic fits from which Respondent No.2 was suffering and for which she was undergoing treatment, was concealed from the Petitioners.

10. The consistent opinion of the Doctors about Respondent No.2 was that she was suffering from Bipolar Maniac Disorder and that she needed medical treatment for her entire life. The Doctors also advised her to take her medicines regularly and to follow the instructions. However, Respondent No.2 was not serious about her treatment and kept neglecting her medicines. The Doctors tried to ask about the medical history of Respondent No.2 from her parents, but they kept on denying and for these reasons the disorder of Respondent No.2 has become incurable.

11. In January 2013, father of Respondent No.2 wrote an email to father of Petitioner No.1 confessing his guilt and unconditionally accepted that what he has done is unpardonable and against the repute of the Petitioners and the family members.

12. In October, 2013 while the son of Petitioners was outstation on duty, the Respondent No.2 acted with extreme aggression against the Petitioners and their staff in their home in Pune. Consequently, mother of Respondent No.2 who works in a school, took leave and came to help. As a last resort, Respondent No.2 was taken to Noida with the minor child because of which the child missed his school for next one month.

13. In November, 2013 Ankur Khatri under tremendous stress for the safety and security of the child and his family, went to the Respondent‟s home in Noida to diffuse and discuss the situation. He finally travelled back with Respondent No.2 and their son to Pune, after which the Respondent No.2 gave an undertaking in writing that she would follow the Psychiatrist‟s advise and manage her behaviour.

14. In March, 2014 the family of Petitioners went through an episode of extremely violent and aggressive behaviour of Respondent No.2 who started beating the child mercilessly. When the Petitioners tried to intervene, not only did she physically assault them but also threatened to make false complaints and cases against them. She further threatened that she had the capability to make them spend their entire life in Police Station and Court. Finding no other alternative, the father of Respondent No.2 was called who after spending three days in the matrimonial home in Pune, left with the Respondent to Noida leaving their child behind.

15. The Respondent No.2 who is a holder of Masters Degree in Computer Application, enrolled herself in Computer Application Course and took up jobs at her parental home in Noida. During this entire period, the son of the Petitioners supported her emotionally as well as financially. However, in return, he received more demands and threats of misusing pro women laws to harass and intimidate him.

16. In January, 2015 tired by the aggression and constant threats of filing Complaints and of committing suicide, Ankur Khatri filed a Petition for divorce under Section 13(1) (iii) and 1(a) of the HMA, 1955, which also included a prayer for custody of the child in the Family Court, Pune.

17. In retaliation to the aforesaid Petition, Respondent No.2 and her parents filed a Complaint dated 26.12.2015 with Women‟s Police Station Noida under Section 498-A, 323, 504, 506 IPC and Section 3 & 4 Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961against her husband as well as the Petitioners including their married daughter living in Hyderabad for the past six years in her matrimonial home. FIR No.154/2015 was registered and after investigations the Chargesheet dated 20.06.2015was submitted against the Petitioners and Ankur Khatri, but it was found that there was no prima facie case against the daughter of the Petitioners.

18. On 17.12.2015, the Respondent No.2 filed a Petition HMA Case No.740/2015 under Section 9 HMA, 1955for Restitution of Conjugal Rights, at Family Court, Gautam Budh Nagar.

20. The Respondent No.2, in furtherance of her malafide intentions to further harass the Petitioners, filed another Complaint No.1430/2016 under Section 128/19/20 and 21 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 before the learned Civil Judge, Gautam BudhNagar, U.P demanding compensation from the husband as well as the present Petitioners.

21. A Transfer Petition (C) No.1987/2015 was filed by the Respondent No.2 before the Supreme Court on 16.09.2016 seeking transfer of the case to the Court of Noida, U.P. The matrimonial case pending before the Pune Court was transferred to the Family Court, Delhi, and the Transfer Petition was disposed of accordingly.

22. Ankur Khatri also filed Transfer Petitions in the Supreme Court on 16.09.2016 seeking transfer of the Criminal Case under Section 498A as well as the Maintenance Petition and the Petition under Domestic Violence Act, which was allowed on 16.12.2016 and all the cases were transferred to Family Court, Delhi.

23. Since the FIR had been registered at Gautam Budh Nagar, U.P, the Chargesheet was filed in FIR No.154/2015 before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Gautam Budh Nagar, who took the Cognizance vide Order dated 18.07.2016 against the Petitioners as well as their son Ankur Khatri. This case also got transferred to CMM, Delhi.

24. The Petitioners have sought the quashing of the Chargesheet under Section 498A IPC and Section 3 & 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act as well as the Petition under Domestic Violence Act on the grounds that the Petitioners are respectable members of the Society and have no criminal antecedents. The Petitioner No.2 is suffering from diabetes and other associated ailments. There are no specific allegations and materials of definite nature against the Petitioners who have been unnecessarily roped in.

26. It is asserted that the FIR has been filed immediately after receiving Notice of the Divorce Petition filed by the husband of Respondent No.2 and is a counterblast.

27. It is further asserted that Respondent No.2 has been living separately since March, 2014 and there is no question of giving beatings by the Petitioners. The relationship between Respondent No.2 and her husband had strained since 2013, so much so that their son had filed the Divorce Petition way back in January, 2015 since he was not interested in residing with Respondent No.2. It is difficult to believe that despite this background, allegations of demand for dowry on 06.12.2015 coupled with criminal intimidation, has been made by Respondent No.2. The allegations so made are vague and have been made with an ulterior motive to harass the Petitioners, which is nothing but misuse of provisions of IPC.

32. It is, therefore, submitted that the Chargesheet No.64/2016under Section 498A/323/504/506 IPC and Section 3 & 4 Dowry Prohibition Act, in respect of FIR No.No.154/2015 as well as the Petition No.1430/2016 under the provisions of Domestic Violence Act, be quashed.

33. The Respondent No.2 Neha Khatri in her Counter-Affidavit has taken a preliminary objection that the captioned Petitions are unsubstantiated, unjustified, self-serving and are factually incorrect, based on entirely wrong premise and is nothing but a gross abuse of process of law. It is claimed that the Petitioners have not approached the Court with clean hands. They have not even placed on record the necessary documents to seek the quashing of the Chargesheet as well as the Petition.

34. The dismissal of the present Petitions is sought on the grounds that there are no cogent and plausible reasons given for this Court to exercise its inherent powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. Secondly, a similar Petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C vide Writ Petition No.8044/2016 was filed before the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad for quashing of FIR No.154/2015, but the same was rejected vide Order dated 13.04.2016. Thirdly, the Chargesheet accompanied with the statements and documents annexed therein, amply and holistically substantiate and establish all the charges against the Petitioners, therefore, no interference is warranted. Fourthly, after filing of the Chargesheet, the Court has taken Cognizance of the offences and issued summons to the accused persons after due consideration of the facts, details, allegations, statements of witnesses and the documentary evidence. There is no ground for quashing of the FIR and the Petition.

35. It is next contended that no harm or prejudice would be caused to the Petitioners upon continuation of the criminal proceedings as right to dignified silence, presumption of innocence would still be available to them. The guilt of the Petitioners has been prima facie confirmed after investigation through Chargesheet, which is sufficient justification for continuation of trial.

36. It is further submitted that at the time of marriage on 25.10.2007, the parents of Respondent No.2 had spent a sum of Rs.25 lakhs on the wedding expenses, gifts and one Hyundai Verna car, but the Petitioners were not satisfied and kept on making more demand and demanded a Pajero Car and other expensive articles from Respondent No.2. On their demands not being fulfilled, they started taunting, mocking, bullying and insulting the Respondent on one pretext or the other. She was tortured, humiliated and harassed throughout for dowry and the conduct continued even during her pregnancy. The Petitioners even took her to the Doctor for determination of the sex of the foetus. After it was confirmed that it was a male child in her womb, their attempt to get it aborted came to an end. Ultimately she gave birth to a son on 30.08.2008.

37. It is asserted that the Petitioners are of greedy nature. Initially most of their demands were met by the parents of the Respondent No.2, but when they stopped succumbing to unlawful demands of the Petitioners and their family members, they became aggressive and frequently misbehaved and maltreated Respondent No.2. The Petitioners started ignoring, neglecting and insulting her for one reason or the other and even did not allow any outsider/visitor to enter her room. They gradually started keeping the child away from her, one pretext or the other. She had no freedom to speak to anyone including her parents on phone and whenever she did, it had to be in the presence of the Petitioners.

38. During the period of 2009 till 2012, while she was residing in her matrimonial home, she was subjected to humiliation, torture and disrespect every day and was not given money for her basic requirements. As and when she visited her parents at Noida, they would give her enough money for her personal requirement. After 2010, her mother started regularly transferring funds to the joint account with Respondent No.2 for her needs.

39. It is further submitted that though Petitioner No.1 did visit the parents of Respondent No.2 at Noida couple of times, during his visit to Delhi for personal work till 2013, but it used to be a nightmare for her parents as he would insult and humiliate them, especially the mother of the Respondent.

Respondent No.2‟s parents visited the Petitioner‟s place at Pune thrice till 2013 to discharge their social obligations. They visited in September, 2011 to attend the Petitioner‟s daughter‟s wedding and even after spending Rs.2.5 lakhs on jewellery and other gifts including cash for Petitioner‟s daughter, they were ignored, insulted and humiliated.

41. Once Respondent No.2 scolded her badly and hit her, when her son was around 4 years old. After this incident, seeing their plan to grab her son was not materializing, they hatched a plan to send her to her parent‟s place. It was in October, 2013 that Petitioners compelled her parents to come to Pune and take her to Noida. Faced with the disrespect by Petitioner No.1, her parents were forced to take her back. They tried to do their best to take back the child who went with them as he did not agree to leave Respondent No.2.

42. On 10.11.2013, Ankur Khatri came to her parental home in Noida to take back the child alone, but when his plan did not succeed, he grudgingly took Respondent No. 2 to Pune to her matrimonial home where she was again subjected to same humiliation, torture physically as well as mentally. There was a short lived reprieve for Respondent No.2 and her parents.

43. In March, 2014 father of Respondent No.2 was called by Petitioner No.1 to Pune and was again humiliated and compelled to take Respondent No.2 back to Noida. Thereafter, she has never been allowed to join the matrimonial home at Pune.

44. Ankur Khatri visited Noida between 23rd to 26th April, 2014 and stayed in her parental home and gave her the assurance that he would settle the matter and the things would normalize. In the next year and a half, Petitioner‟s son, Ankur Khatri again came for spending leave and arranged for the Respondent to visit various places in July 2014, November, 2014 and May, 2015, but he never took her back to the matrimonial home. He kept assuring that he was trying for a shore job in India and that when it would materialize he would take her back. Eventually, she received a Notice of Divorce Petition on 17.11.2015, when she realized that Ankur Khatri had been cheating her by giving time to the child to brainwash him against his own mother.

45. In November, 2014 Respondent was taken to Pune but was brought back after a couple of days to her parental home by the husband of the Respondent No. 2 and his parents, when a fresh demand of Rs.11 lakh was made. Since then, she has been staying with her parents in Noida. They did not let her talk to her son. From sheer desperation, she had travelled to Pune on 30.09.2015 to have a glance of her son. The mother-in-law opened the door but they did not permit her to talk to the child or to enter the matrimonial home. Left with no option, she spent the night in the neighbourhood and returned to Delhi/Noida on the next day.

46. Thereafter on 05.12.2015 the Petitioners along with Ankur Khatri, visited her parental home and tried to force her to agree for a compromise for divorce, which she vehemently opposed. Again on 06.12.2015, the husband of Respondent No.2 along with his parents and son visited the Respondent and coerced her to agree to the Divorce. Eventually, they snatched the crying child from Respondent No.2 and took him away. They even threatened to get Ankur Khatri remarried. She made the Complaint dated 17.12.2015 at Woman Police Station, which resulted in registration of FIR and filing of the Chargesheet.

48. It is submitted that she also filed a Petition under Section 9 of HMA, 1955 for Restitution of Conjugal Rights. Eventually, on filing of Transfer Petitions either by her or by the Ankur Khatri, all their litigations have been transferred to Delhi.

49. It is further contended that after the Cognizance was taken on the Chargesheet on 20.06.2015, the Order was not challenged till 2018 i.e. for more than one and a half years. The present Petition thus, suffers from delay and laches. Furthermore, there is an alternate remedy with the Petitioners to seek their discharge at the time of framing of Charge. It is submitted that the two petitions are an abuse of the process of Court and are liable to be dismissed.

54. In the Rejoinder Affidavit filed by the Petitioners to the Counter- Affidavit of Respondent No.2, the contentions as raised in the main Petition, were reiterated and the allegations made in the Counter-affidavit were denied.

55. It is further asserted that in the Medical Assessment Report of Moolchand Hospital filed by the Respondent No.2 along with her Reply, it is stated that she has deliberately not commented on her medical papers which has a history of six years from May, 2008 to March, 2014; neither is she rejecting them or accepting it. The medical history which covers more than 75 visits to the Psychiatrist, also states no Complaints against the Petitioners or Respondent‟s husband.

56. The Assessment Report of Respondent No.2 and her medical record of six years, were taken to another reputed Psychiatrist Dr. M.B. Pethe at Pune, for independent opinion. He opined that the Psychological Test Report shows no disclosure by the patient about her prolonged medication and past history of sickness and that Respondent No.2 suffers from Schizo- affective Psychosis for many years. In such sickness even if the disease is in remission, the test invariably would show residual features of her past illness and it can never be an absolute normal Report.

57. Submissions heard and record perused.

58. These two Petitions arise from a matrimonial dispute between the Respondent No.2, Ms. Neha Khatri and her husband, Ankur Khatri. They got married in the year 2007 and were blessed with a son in the year 2008. According to Respondent No.2, there were matrimonial disputes inter se her and her husband and the parents-in-law which eventually resulted in her separation from the husband in March, 2014. The Petitioners who are the parents-in-law of the Complainant have sought the quashing of the FIR as well as Petition under DV Act, on merits.

59. Before embarking on the merits of the case, it is pertinent to observe that in the 1980‟s, daily there were daily cases reported of the girls being subjected to harassment and even of dowry deaths by burning. This reflected an alarming situation in the Society of the women being the victim of the gravest of the crime committed upon them, not only by men but also by the women. The Legislature in its wisdom recognized the persistent and deep rooted nature of this underlying social malice of dowry and its consequent effects and the pressing need for law to address this grave suffering being inflicted on the women, as a result of dowry related offences.

61. However, the experience over past so many years has shown that while in some cases it may have been really successful in dealing with the situation and also address issues of dowry demands to some extent, but in many of the reported cases, it has been found to be used as a mean and an arm twisting tactic to settle the other dispute which may arise in the matrimonial relationship. It has become an easy tool in the hands of the Complainants to settle the scores by getting false FIRs registered containing the exaggerated and manipulated allegations.

71. Further objection has been raised that a similar attempt to quash the FIR was made by filing a Writ Petition before the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, which was dismissed by Order dated 13.04.2016 on the ground that the FIR disclosed a cognizable offence.

72. It is correct that an earlier endeavour for quashing of the FIR was made by the Petitioners by filing a Writ Petition before the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, which got dismissed on 13.04.2016.However, it cannot be overlooked that what was sought to be quashed at that stage was the FIR itself. FIR which prima facie disclosed a cognizable offence definitely merits investigations to assert the truthfulness of the allegations.

73. However, after the registration of FIR, due investigations have been conducted and all the available evidence against the Petitioners, has been collected. The grounds and the circumstances on which the quashing is now sought of the Chargesheet emanating from the FIR, is inherently different from those that could have been considered at the stage of quashing of FIR itself, without any further investigations. Therefore, the earlier rejection of the Writ Petition for quashing of the FIR, cannot be considered as a circumstance to dismiss the present Writ Petition at the outset.

74. The contentions of the Petitioners need to be considered on merits, to ascertain if it is a case which mandates quashing of proceedings against them.

82. Further, in the aforementioned judgments, it was reiterated that where the FIR or the Complaint even if taken on the face value and accepted in their entirety, do not prima facie constitute a case against the accused, the quashing of proceedings would be justified. Only stating cruelty has been committed by the Appellants, would not amount to an offence under Section 498A IPC.

83. In the light of aforesaid discussion, facts of this case may now be considered to ascertain whether the circumstances justify quashing of FIR registered under Sections 498A/323/504/506 IPC.

93. Respondent No.2 in her Complaint filed under Section 498A IPC to the Superintendent of Police claimed that a lot of money was spent on her marriage. Her father gave Rs.5 lakhs cash and aside from gold and diamond sets, rings of Rs.7-8 lakhs, he also gave gold coins to all the in- laws apart from costly clothes, furniture, electronic goods and a Verna Car so that she could live happily in her matrimonial home. A sum of Rs.25 lakhs was spent in her marriage.

94. From these averments made in the Complaint, it only emerges that her parents had spent a lot of money and given gifts on the occasion of her marriage with the intent of the Respondent No.2 being happy in her matrimonial home. There is no averment whatsoever that any demand for dowry was made either prior or at the time for the expenditure incurred in the function of marriage. What emerges is that the Complainant‟s family had performed the marriage according to their status, and had spent money accordingly.

95. Respondent No.2 has further claimed that the Petitioners, her husband Ankur Khatri as well as her sister-in-law Deeksha had consistently made a demand of Rs.11 lakhs in cash and a Pajero Car and used to pressurize and assault her regularly and even pressurized to kill her. She also claimed that in November, 2014, she was taken to Pune but was brought back after a couple of days to her parental home by the husband of the Respondent No.

2. Since then, she has been staying with her parents in Noida. It is alleged that at this time, Petitioners made a fresh demand of Rs.11 lakh.

96. Pertinently, this allegation has no specific date or time and whether it was allegedly made prior to or at the time of birth of the son in 2008 and has continued till November, 2014 when she finally left for her parental home. The differences had arisen since March, 2013 and the bald allegations made by the Complainant, are nothing but a desperate attempt to somehow make the allegations of demands to bring the case under Section 498A IPC.

97. The statement of mother, Smt. Madhubala and father, Shri Subhash Chander were recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. during the investigations, but there too, aside from this vague allegation of demand of Rs.11 lakhs and Pajero car, there is essentially no allegation of dowry harassment or of cruelty.

100. The other allegations are that she was treated as a maid/ servant and was made to do the work. She has claimed that she was being assaulted, beaten and was also threatened by the Petitioners. She was not allowed to touch any book or computer and was harassed and told not to use any of these things. The Petitioners and the sister-in-law also instigated her husband to take divorce. In November, 2014 she was left by the Petitioners at her parental home at Noida. Thereafter, several efforts were made by her father, but the Petitioners abused her father and did ""maar peet‟ with her and left the place by threatening that if their demands were not fulfilled, they would perform the second marriage of Ankur.

101. However, there is not a single date or medical document to support her assertions aside from the bald claim of being beaten, there is no specific incident revealed in the statement of any of the prosecution witnesses.

103. Here also, these allegations are only general and omnibus and it is not stated when she was allegedly beaten and by whom. As has already been noted, the allegations of cruelty simplicitor are not sufficient but must be of the kind which could have driven her to cause harm to herself. The allegations made in the Complaint even if accepted in toto, do not prove that she was subjected to cruelty of the kind which could have driven her to cause harm to herself nor can it be said that there was any kind of harassment on account of dowry demands.

105. The Petitioners have asserted that since prior to her marriage, the Respondent No.2 had some mental issues and had been on medication. It is the claim of the Petitioners that Respondent No.2 had been diagnosed with Bipolar Maniac Disorder and was under regular treatment.

106. Per Contra, Respondent No.2 in her Response has asserted that after she was left at her parental home at Noida, she was taken by her father to Doctor Jitender Nagpal, Consultant Psychiatrist and In-charge, Department of Mental Health, Institute of Child Development and Adolescent health, Moolchand Hospital, New Delhi, where she was made to undergo Exhaustive Clinical and Psychological Tests. The detailed tests did not find any „Pathognomonic Indicators‟ hinting any underlying significant thought or mood level disturbances. She had claimed that it is the concocted story of the Petitioners regarding the Respondent suffering from mental disorder.

107. The Respondent No.2 herself has placed on record the Assessment Report of Moolchand Hospital, where her examination has been conducted from 09.03.2016 to 12.03.2016, wherein in her history it is stated that she had visited the Department to establish her capability to take care of a child and the other responsibilities. As per the information shared by Respondent No.2 Neha and later affirmed by her parents who were the chief informants, it was stated that there has been a history of Post-Partum Psychosis for which she was under medication. She got married in 2007 but because of significant interpersonal issues since beginning, her condition deteriorated with time. Her husband was in Merchant Navy and was away for most part of the year. Initially, he was supportive, but with time, the Respondent No.2 shared that he was always taking side with his mother.

108. She had claimed that her over sleepiness and lethargy was due to the medication on which she had been put and which she had continued even after she supposedly recovered from whatever problems she was undergoing after the delivery of the child. Her resistance was not acknowledged and according to her she was kept under influence of medication even when she did not need them.

111. The Complainant has asserted that the Petitioners did not let her meet her husband. However, these averments pertain essentially to the year 2013 while the Parties got married in the year 2007. While considering this allegation, it cannot be overlooked that the husband was in the Merchant Navy and would necessarily be away from home for long periods of time. No circumstance whatsoever has been disclosed to explain how he was prevented from staying with her.

112. The Complainant herself has averred that Ankur Khatri visited her in her parental home at Noida between 23rd to 26th April, 2014 and stayed in her parental home and gave her the assurance that he would settle the matter and the things would normalize. In the next year and a half, Ankur Khatri again came for spending leave and arranged for the Respondent to visit various places in July 2014, November, 2014 and May, 2015. He kept assuring that he was trying for a shore job in India and that when it would materialize he would take her back.

113. Her own narration of events in the Complaint, are contradictory to her assertion that the husband was being prevented from meeting her. The reason as clearly manifest is the differences between the parties and not an act of cruelty or harassment by the Petitioners.

115. Immediately thereafter, Respondent No.2 and her parents filed a Complaint dated 26.12.2015 with Women‟s Police Station Noida under Section 498-A, 323, 504, 506 IPC and Section 3 & 4 Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961against her husband as well as the Petitioners including their married daughter living in Hyderabad for the past six years in her matrimonial home.

116. Not only this, on 17.12.2015, the Respondent No.2 filed a Petition HMA Case No.740/2015 under Section 9 Hindu Marriage Act, 1955for Restitution of Conjugal Rights, at Family Court, Gautam Budh Nagar. Had there been any harassment or alleged cruelty, no person would seek a Decree of Restitution to join back the matrimonial home. Her immediate seeking of restitution is a significant give away to the allegations being made only to somehow, arm twist the Petitioners and her husband to resolve their disputes.

119. Another significant aspect is that the sister of the Husband who was married and living in her matrimonial home in Hyderabad was also roped in by the complainant, which also reflects a tendency to rope in other family members as a pressure tactic. This is reinforced from the fact that after investigations, Chargesheet dated 20.06.2015 was submitted against the Petitioners and Ankur Khatri, in the Court but it was found that there was no prima facie case against the daughter of the Petitioners and she was not Charge-Sheeted.

120. Complainant, in her Complaint has next alleged that her son was not been permitted to stay with her and she was also been denied an access to the child. She has asserted that that she received a Notice of Divorce Petition on 17.11.2015 and that it was then she realized that Ankur Khatri had been cheating her by gaining time to the child to brainwash him against his own mother.

122. Thus, the essential ingredients of Section 498A IPC are not made out from the Complaint made by Respondent No.2.The entire Complaint and the evidence collected during the investigations in the present matter, even if admitted in toto, would not be enough to prove an offence under Section 498A IPC. As already noted above, the onerous duty lies on the Court on one hand, to ensure that the true victims get justice and on the other hand, to ensure that Section 498A IPC, a salutary endeavour of legislation to address the menace of harassment of women by the husband and the in-Laws; must not be permitted to be misused and abused in order to ensure the credibility and faith in the justice delivery system.

123. Therefore, in the light of the aforesaid discussion, it is evident from the statement of Respondent No.2 and the supporting witnesses that it is a case where there was an adjustment issue between the Respondent No.2 and her husband which has been given a colour of dowry harassment. It is more of a case of misuse of the provisions of Section 498A IPC by the Respondent No.2 and has been filed as a counter blast to the Divorce Petition filed by the husband Ankur Khatri in the year 2015. Clearly, no Complaint whatsoever got filed till the filing of the Divorce Petition and it is only thereafter, that the Respondent No.2 made a Complaint with the vague allegations.

127. Accordingly, Chargesheet No.64/16 dated 20.06.2016 filed in Case Crime No. 152/2015 filed under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 IPC and Section 3/4 of Dowry Prohibition Act, registered in Women Police Station Gautam Budh Nagar, U.P.along with the subsequent proceedings,is hereby, quashed.

Quashing of Petition under Domestic Violence Act:

128. The Petitioners in the present petition, are seeking quashing of the Complaint Case No. 1430 of 2016 filed under Sections 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22 Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as ""DV Act""), along with the Summoning Order dated 23.06.2017 and the Order of issuing Notice dated 23.01.2018, of the Learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Mahila Court, Delhi.

129. The question is whether proceedings initiated under the DV Act is liable to be quashed by invoking the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.

136. Once it is noted that the DV Act deals with the Civil remedies, next question which arises is whether Application under Section 12 DV Actfiled by Respondent is liable to be quashed under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

138. First ground on which quashing is sought is that the averments in the Application under Section 12 DV Act does not establish the prerequisite of Domestic Violence.There is no prima facie evidence of violence of any kind to which the respondent has been subjected and the DV petition is not maintainable.

139. The Respondent-Wife has sought reliefs for Protection, Residence Order, Monetary Relief, Custody of the child as well as Compensation Order in her Complaint under the DV Act.

144. In the present case, the Respondent-wife has sought reliefs for Protection, Residence Order, Monetary Relief, Custody of the child as well as Compensation Order in her Complaint under the DV Act.

145. Therefore, even if the contention of Petitioner is accepted that there was no domestic violence, then too, the right to claim residence is still maintainable.

146. The second ground for seeking quashing of the Application under Section 12 DV Act, is that the allegations against the Petitioners are vague and made with ulterior motive to harass the Petitioners. They have asserted that there are no specific allegations of violence or abuse of any kind to which the respondent has been subjected and therefore, the DV Petition is not maintainable.

147. As already noted above, it is essentially a civil proceeding and whether the Respondent-wife is entitled to the reliefs sought by her in her petition under Section 12 of the DV Act is a matter to be adjudicated upon by the Learned MM after considering the case on its merits. It cannot be held at this stage, that the proceedings are vexatious or that outrightly no cause of action is disclosed in the Petition and is liable to be quashed.

148. There is no ground made out for quashing of the D.V. Complaint filed by the Respondent at this stage.

149. However, the Petitioners are at liberty to agitate his contentions on merit before the learned Metropolitan Magistrate who shall consider them in accordance with law while deciding the Petition under Section 12 of the DV Act.

150. The Writ Petition No. 721/2018 seeking quashing of Complaint case No. 1430/2016 is hereby dismissed.

Relief:

151. The W.P.(CRL) No. 720/2018, is allowed and Chargesheet No.64/16 dated 20.6.2016 filed in Case Crime No. 152/2015 filed under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 IPC and Section 3/4 of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 registered in Women Police Station Gautam Budh Nagar, U.P. along with the subsequent proceedings, is hereby, quashed.

152. The W.P. (CRL) No. 721/2018, seeking quashing of Complaint case No. 1430/2016under D.V. Act, is hereby dismissed.

153. Accordingly, the pending Application(s), if any, stand disposed of.

(NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA) JUDGE JUNE 28, 2025 Va"
Aftab Ahmad vs The State Of Bihar,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/125915492/,"Patna High Court
Md. Aftab Ahmad @ Aftab Ahmad vs The State Of Bihar on 17 June, 2025
Date : 17-06-2025 The present Criminal Revision petition has been preferred by the petitioner against the impugned judgment and order of sentence dated 29.09.2021, passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge-III, Nalanda at Biharsharif in Criminal Appeal No. 20 of 2019, whereby the judgment of conviction and order of sentence passed by learned Trial Court against the petitioner has been upheld, though the co-convict viz., Daizy was acquitted. Learned Trial Court vide judgment and order of sentence dated 21.05.2019 had found the petitioner herein guilty under Section 498A of the IPC and sentenced him Patna High Court CR. REV. No.23 of 2022 dt.17-06-2025 to S.I. for one year and to pay a fine of Rs. 5,000/- and in default to pay the fine, he was further directed to suffer additional S.I. for one month.

Prosecution Case

2. The prosecution case as emerging from the written report to the police is that the informant/Sanowar Jahan was married to the petitioner/Md Aftab Ahmad @ Aftab Ahmad in the year 1993 and a daughter was born out of the wedlock. At the time of marriage, Rs. 50,000/- in cash, jewelry of golden and silver, clothes, utensils and furniture were also given. After the marriage, the informant joined the matrimonial home. But, after some time, the husband, mother-in-law/Mumtaz Ara, sister-in- law, Kaisar Jahan and husband of sister-in-law, Fahimuddin started demanding additional dowry by way of motorcycle and Rs. 50,000/-, failing which she was threatened not to be allowed to settle at the matrimonial home. On account of non-fulfillment of demand of dowry, the accused started committing physical and mental cruelty against the informant. However, the same was tolerated by her, hoping that good day would come. But the accused persons kept torturing and depriving her of food. She used to inform her parents regarding the demand of dowry, but they used to express their inability to fulfill the demand and Patna High Court CR. REV. No.23 of 2022 dt.17-06-2025 used to go to her matrimonial home to make the accused understand their inability to fulfill the demand. But despite that, the accused persons mixed poison in her food with intent to kill her. However, she got inkling that poison was mixed in her food and hence, she threw the food. The accused persons also tried to kill her. On 28.08.2001, the accused persons snatched all the gift items from the informant and ousted her from the matrimonial home after beating her. Somehow, she came back to her parental home along with her daughter.

Evidence of Both the Parties

3. During trial, altogether the following witnesses were examined on behalf of the prosecution:-

(i) P.W.-1 is Md. Anwar Nasim.
(ii) P.W.-2 is Md. Nisar Ahmed.
(iii) P.W.-3 is Sanowar Jahan.
(iv) P.W.-4 is Shahid Ahmed.
4. The prosecution also brought on record the written complaint by marking it as Ext.-1. However, no other documentary evidence was produced by the prosecution.

Findings of the Trial Court

7. After appreciating the evidence on record and considering the submissions advanced by the parties, learned Trial Court found only the petitioner herein Md. Aftab Alam @ Aftab Alam and co-accused, Daizy guilty under Section 498A/34 of IPC and sentencing both of them to S.I. for one year and pay a fine of Rs. 5,000/- and in default to pay the fine, they were further directed to suffer additional S.I. for one month. However, both of them were acquitted of charge under Sections 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act. Other co-accused were acquitted of all charges.

Findings of the Appellate Court

8. Being aggrieved by the judgment and order of sentence passed by learned Trial Court, the convicts including the petitioner preferred Criminal Appeal bearing No. 20 of 2019 before learned Sessions Court. The appeal was allowed qua Daizy and she was acquitted. However, judgment of conviction and order of sentence passed by learned Trial Court against the Patna High Court CR. REV. No.23 of 2022 dt.17-06-2025 petitioner herein was upheld. Hence, being aggrieved by the judgment of the Appellate Court, the petitioner has preferred the present revision petition.

Submissions on behalf of the Petitioner

9. I heard learned counsel for the petitioner, learned APP for the State and learned counsel for the informant.

10. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the impugned judgment is not sustainable either in law or on facts. Learned Appellate Court has committed error of law and facts to uphold the conviction of the petitioner under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

11. To substantiate his submission, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner has been already acquitted of charge under Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act and the same was never challenged by the prosecution before any higher court. Hence, the demand of dowry could not be proved by the prosecution and there is no allegation of any such conduct on the part of the petitioner which could have driven the informant to commit suicide or caused grave injury or danger to her life, limb or health. Hence, the conviction of the petitioner under Section 498A IPC was erroneous as it is based on no evidence in support of it. Patna High Court CR. REV. No.23 of 2022 dt.17-06-2025 Submissions on behalf of the Opposite Parties

12. Learned APP for the State and learned counsel for the O.P. No. 2, however, defend the impugned judgment passed by the learned Appellate Court submitting that there is no illegality or infirmity in it. But as per record, there is neither error of law, nor perversity of any finding. The judgment is based on proper appreciation of law and facts and this Court under revisional jurisdiction is not required to re-appreciate the evidence and supplant its opinion in place of that of the Trial Court or the Appellate Court, who have concurrently upheld the conviction and order of sentence passed against the petitioner herein. He further submits that the petitioner has not pointed out any exceptional situations which may require interference by this Court in the impugned judgment and order of sentence.

13. I considered the submissions advanced by the parties and perused the materials on record.

(Emphasis supplied)

43. Under revisional jurisdiction, the High Court is Patna High Court CR. REV. No.23 of 2022 dt.17-06-2025 not entitled to re-appreciate the evidence for itself as if it is acting as a Court of appeal, because revisional power cannot be equated with the power of an Appellate Court, nor can it be treated even as a second appellate jurisdiction. Hence, ordinarily, it is not appropriate for the High Court to re- appreciate the evidence and come to its own conclusion on the same when the evidence has already been appreciated by the Trial and Appellate Court, unless there are exceptional situations like glaring error of law or procedure and perversity of finding, causing flagrant miscarriage of justice, brought to the notice of the High Court. Such exceptional situations have been enumerated by Hon'ble Apex Court on several occasions which are as follows:-

(i) when it is found that the trial court has no jurisdiction to try the case or;
(ii) when it is found that the order under revision suffers from glaring illegality or;
(iii) where the trial court has illegally shut out the evidence which otherwise ought to have been considered or;
(iv) where the judgment/order is based on inadmissible evidence, or;
(v) where the material evidence which clinches the Patna High Court CR. REV. No.23 of 2022 dt.17-06-2025 issue has been overlooked either by the Trial Court or the Appellate Court or;
(vi) where there is perverse appreciation of evidence or;
(vii) where the acquittal is based on a compounding of the offence, which is invalid under the law.
45. Moreover, in revisional jurisdiction, the High Court is also prohibited by express provision in Section 401 (3) Cr.PC to convert the finding of acquittal into one of conviction. However, if it is found by the High Court that finding of acquittal is recorded on account of misreading of evidence or non-consideration of evidence or perverse appreciation of evidence, the High Court can direct re-trial by pointing out such situations and thereafter, the Trial Court is obliged to re- appreciate the evidence in light of the observation of the Revisional Court and take an independent view uninfluenced by any of the observations of the Revisional Court on the merit of the case.

Present Case

47. I further find that the main submission on behalf of the petitioner is that for want of any proof in support of allegation of demand of dowry as alleged in the FIR, charge under Section 498A IPC against the petitioner fails, because there is no evidence of any such conduct on the part of the petitioner which could have caused grave injury or danger to the life, limb or health of the informant. Hence, the impugned judgment passed by the learned Appellate Court suffers from perverse appreciation of evidence and hence, it is liable to be set aside.

Findings and Order of this Court

53. Hence, the only question to be considered is whether the finding of the Trial Court and the Appellate Court regarding guilt of the petitioner under Section 498A IPC is sustainable. In other words, whether such findings of the Courts Patna High Court CR. REV. No.23 of 2022 dt.17-06-2025 below are based on perverse appreciation of evidence or there is no evidence in support of such finding or that is based on inadmissible evidence or any material evidence has been overlooked by the Courts below.

54. From perusal of the FIR, prosecution evidence and the close scrutiny of the judgments of the Trial Court as well as the Appellate Court, I find that thrust of the allegation leveled by the informant/wife against the petitioner/husband is that husband/petitioner was harassing her with intent to coerce her and her relative to meet unlawful demand of dowry and in this regard, there is also allegation of committing physical and mental cruelty to the informant. However, I find that allegation of demand of dowry has already been found false by the Trial Court as well as the Appellate Court and the same has not been challenged by the informant in any higher Court.

55. I further find that before lodging the FIR, a letter was admittedly written by the informant to the Registrar General, Patna High Court, Patna, which does not disclose any allegation of physical or mental cruelty committed by the petitioner against the informant as the informant/wife has clearly admitted in her cross-examination. It has also come in the cross-examination of the informant/wife that no injury report Patna High Court CR. REV. No.23 of 2022 dt.17-06-2025 was prepared during investigation, nor had she shown any mark of injury to the police. But I find that such material evidence has been overlooked by the Trial Court as well as the Appellate Court. As such, there is no cogent evidence adduced by the informant and her witnesses to prove any willful conduct on the part of the petitioner/husband against the informant/wife which could have caused grave injury or danger to life, limb or health of the informant/wife. There is also no evidence to prove the allegation of harassment with intent to coerce the informant or her relative to meet unlawful demand for any property or valuable security.

56. Hence, I find that finding of conviction by the Trial Court as well as the Appellate Court is based on perverse appreciation of the evidence and misreading/overlooking material evidence, causing miscarriage of justice, warranting interference by this Revisional Court. Hence, the impugned judgment of conviction and order of sentence are not sustainable in the eye of law and and they are liable to be set aside.

57. Accordingly, the present petition is allowed, setting aside the impugned judgment of conviction and order of sentence, acquitting the petitioner of all the charges.

58. Any interlocutory applications, if pending, stand Patna High Court CR. REV. No.23 of 2022 dt.17-06-2025 disposed of. Let Lower Court Records along with a copy of this order be sent back to the Courts concerned.

Sebastian Jeronimo Pereira & Anr. vs Alisha David,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/136790938/,"Delhi High Court
Sebastian Jeronimo Pereira & Anr. vs Alisha David on 17 January, 2025
1. The Petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as „Cr.P.C‟) has been filed for quashing of CTC No.6647/2020 filed by the Respondent, Alisha David under Section 12(1) read with Section 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 of the Protection of Women against Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as „DV Act‟) against the Petitioners.

2. The Petitioner No.1, Sebastian Jeronimo Pereira got married to Respondent, Alisha David on 21.01.2015 under the Special Marriage Act, 1954. From their wedlock, one son, Schneiden Pereira was born on 18.03.2016, while the Respondent was in Darjeeling.

3. It is claimed that soon after the marriage, there were frequent quarrels between the parties. In March, 2015 the Respondent went away to Hyderabad without informing Petitioner No.1. He eventually found out that she was based in Hyderabad, from her friends. She returned after about 4-5 days, but again in October, 2015 she stayed with her friend at Bhayandar and eventually moved to her mother‟s house in Darjeeling. It is claimed that despite repeated efforts by Petitioner No.1 to reconcile the differences and to bring her back, the Respondent did not meet any success. Eventually, Petitioner No.1 went to Darjeeling and brought the Respondent and the child back to Mumbai, on 04.02.2017.

4. The Respondent acted abusively on 31.05.2017 and harassed the Petitioners including his mother/Petitioner No.2, who is an aged lady. While Petitioner No.1 was at work, the Respondent along with the child left for Gurgaon where her brother resides, without informing Petitioner No.1.

5. Amidst attempts of reconciliation, Petitioner No.1 made sure that the Respondent and the child were well taken care of by regularly transferring money to the Respondent for their expenses. However, on 10.05.2018 the Respondent came back from Delhi and created a scene at the work place of Petitioner No.1 resulting in loss of his job. Thereafter, the Respondent handed over the custody of the child to Petitioner No.1 at Police Station Mahim (East) and since then the child has been in custody of Petitioner No.1 and going to school in Mumbai.

6. The Petitioner No.1 also filed a Suit for Permanent Injunction in May, 2018 to restrain the Respondent from taking the custody of the child. Eventually, on 28.03.2019, Petitioner No.1 and the Respondent entered into Consent Terms in Petition No.53/2018 wherein it was agreed that the child would remain in the custody of Petitioner No.1 while Respondent would visit the child in Court premises in accordance with the Terms agreed between the parties.

7. On 26.02.2020, the Respondent came to visit Petitioner No.1 for a short while and decided to live with Petitioner No.1 and the child. On 14.03.2020, she brought him back to Mumbai, but due to complete lockdown imposed after a few days, he was constrained could not ask her to leave but to allow her to continue to live in his house. However, she continuously harassed the Petitioners and did not take any interest in the upbringing of the child.

8. On 01.10.2020, the Respondent took the child from Petitioner No.1 on the pretext of taking him to park, but came to Delhi without informing him resulting in extreme alarm as the child did not return home. He filed a Missing Person Complaint with MHB Station in Borivali but he subsequently came to know that the child had been wrongly taken away by the Respondent. He asserted that her coming to stay in Mumbai from 14.03.2020 was a wilful ploy to take the child out of his custody.

9. On 06.10.2020, the Petitioner No.1 filed an Application in Family Court Mumbai for restoration of custody of the child and also filed an Application seeking directions to the Respondent to bring back the child to Mumbai. He was allowed virtual meeting with the child, but the Respondent failed to comply and a Contempt Petition was filed by the Petitioner No.1.

10. Eventually, the Respondent filed a Transfer petition, T.P.(C) NO.65 of 2021, before the Apex Court for transfer of the Suit for Permanent Injunction from the Family Court, Mumbai to Delhi, but the same got dismissed vide Order dated 03.02.2022.

11. Thereafter, on 22.12.2020, the Respondent has filed the Complaint under D.V. Act seeking the following reliefs :

                                      (i)        Protection order under Section 18 of the Act;
                                      (ii)       for restraining the Petitioner from committing any act of
                                                 Domestic Violence;
                                      (iii)      to pass Order under Section 19; and
                                      (iv)       for monetary relief/maintenance.

12. She also lodged a Complaint under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as „IPC, 1860‟) which was another counterblast to the Petitioner‟s Application for restoration of Custody and the Contempt Petition as there was no earlier Complaint lodged by the Respondent with the Police or otherwise about any such alleged acts. In the interim, the Family Court, Mumbai allowed the Petitioner‟s Application vide Order dated 11.01.2021 and eventually the custody of the child was returned to him on 16.01.2021.

13. The Petitioner has sought the quashing of this Petition on the ground that the proceedings under the D.V. Act have been initiated maliciously as a counterblast due to her private and personal grudges against Petitioner No.1. She in fact, committed Contempt of Court by taking away the custody of child from him; her filing of Petition is an abuse of process of the Court. It is claimed that the Petition has been filed only to harass and cause inconvenience to him. He is residing in Mumbai and is a primary caregiver of the child and is taking care of his day to day activities and his schooling. The Petitioner cannot appear before learned M.M. in Delhi without significant distress to the child. The Petitioner No.2 is an aged lady of 70 years and is a patient of asthma, which renders her more vulnerable to Covid-19 and it is difficult for her to travel.

14. Furthermore, the Complaint has not been filed within one year of alleged Domestic Violence. The Complaint has been filed on 22.12.2020 and is barred by limitation under Section 468 of Cr.P.C.

15. The Complaint is being filed belatedly 2½ years after the alleged act of violence and that too only because the custody of the child was restored to Petitioner No.1 in Consent Terms of 28.03.2019.

No allegations whatsoever of Domestic Violence have been made in 2½ years preceding the Complaint. She voluntarily separated from Petitioner No.1 and moved to Delhi for 2 years. She herself voluntarily came to reside with the Petitioner No.1 in March, 2020. As such she has ceased to be an aggrieved person in the eyes of law.

17. Moreover, the entire allegations made in the Complaint are untrue and thus, the present Petition is liable to be quashed.

21. Hence, the Prayer is made that the Petition under D.V. Act be quashed.

22. The Respondent in her Counter-Affidavit has taken the Preliminary Objections that from the bare perusal of the Petition, it is evident that the Petitioners have not approached this Court with unclean hands and has suppressed material facts. The Petition has been filed with an ulterior and oblique motive to abuse the process of law by seeking quashing of Domestic Violence case in order to intimidate and/or pressurize the Respondent to agree to the larger designs of the Petitioners to prevent her from availing the remedies available to her under law. There are specific allegations of demand of dowry and entrustment made in the Complaint aside from physical and mental cruelty. The averments in the Complaint prima facie disclose the commission of domestic violence and mental cruelty by the Petitioners for which various Complaints have been made to the Mumbai Police, Gurugram Police and Delhi Police.

23. It is asserted that soon after the marriage, the Petitioner No.1 treated the Respondent with utmost cruelty which she suffered in silence thinking that the acts of Petitioner No.1 were attributable to his being drunk since he was a habitual alcohol consumer.

24. In March, 2015 the atrocities increased to such an extent that she was left with no option but to lodge a Police Complaint on 31.03.2015 for the first time against the Petitioners. It is further claimed that because of the persistent demands of dowry by the Petitioners, she took up a private job, but after some time she conceived and required extra care and because of her complications, she left the job. This infuriated the Petitioners and they started neglecting her and taunting her on petty issues, thereby causing utmost cruelty. After the birth of the child, on the persuasion of the Petitioners and their promise that they would not treat her with cruelty, she along with the child, returned to matrimonial home in February, 2017 and they all resided in rented accommodation for about 2 months till 16.04.2017 after which they again shifted to their own house. However, the harassment and cruelty commenced again and she was compelled to leave the matrimonial home on 31.05.2017, when she went to her friend‟s house in Thane, from where she went to her brother‟s house in Gurugram, Haryana on 02.06.2017.

25. She further asserted that she had been lured into writing a Letter and to give temporary custody of the child to Petitioner No.1, who thereafter filed a Petition for Permanent custody of child in Family Court, Mumbai and an Order of Injunction against the Respondent from entering the house of the Petitioners. Eventually when she went to meet the child, he refused to recognize her. Thereafter, she suffered from stress attack and severe pain in chest and was taken to Family Care Hospital, Mahim, Mumbai, but none of the Petitioners came to enquire about her health. With the intervention of Padri, she was allowed to see her child after 8 days. The Police complaint dated 25.12.2018 was made by her.

26. The Respondent submits that though she had filed a Complaint dated 18.04.2019 before the CAW Cell, Gurugram, Haryana, but the Police Officials have failed to take any notice and the Petitioners failed to appear before the CAW Cell. Rather, she was told to withdraw her Complaint and to go back to the matrimonial home. On the assurances from Petitioner No.1 that he would also withdraw the child custody case, she withdrew her Complaint on 27.05.2019. After the withdrawal of her Complaint, she was allowed to stay in the house of the Petitioner, but when she refused to give an Affidavit that she had filed a false Complaint before CAW Cell, Gurugram, she was again thrown out of the matrimonial home and she came back to her brother‟s house on 24.07.2019.

27. It is asserted that there are specific averments of allegations of Domestic Violence made in the Complaint and it is not liable to be quashed.

28. On merits, she has reiterated the facts as narrated above and has submitted that the present Petition is mala fide and abuse of process of law and is liable to be dismissed.

29. Submissions heard and record perused.

30. The Petitioner No.1-husband has sought the quashing of the CTC No. 6647/2020 filed under Sections 12(1) read with Sections 18/19/20/21/22 of the DV Act.

33. From the Statement of Objects and Reasons, it is abundantly clear and needs no further elaboration that the remedies provided under the DV Act are civil remedies and not criminal.

40. The second limb of the Argument is that the present Application under DV Act filed by the Respondent, is vexatious, malicious and a retaliatory measure to Application for grant of custody of the child filed by him. It is asserted by the Petitioner that there are no averments made which could justify the filing of an Application under Section 12 of the DV Act.

44. The Petitioner has asserted that there is no prima facie evidence of violence of any kind to which the respondent has been subjected and the DV petition is not maintainable.

48. Therefore, even if the contention of Petitioner is accepted that there was no domestic violence, then too the right to claim residence is still maintainable.

49. Undeniably, the parties got married on 21.01.2015 and there may have been chequered history of parties separating since 06.11.2015, but even thereafter, the parties have been meeting and have been regularly in touch. It is not denied that the Respondent had come to the house of the Petitioner- Husband where she had stayed in his house during the COVID-19 period. Therefore, at this stage, it cannot be said that there is no merit in the Complaint. After considering the totality of the circumstances, this is not an appropriate stage for the Court to consider the merits of the averments made and to observe that outrightly no cause of action is disclosed in the Petition and to assess if the allegations are vague and whether any relief is warranted on the merits of the case.

51. There is no ground made out for quashing of the CTC No.6647/2020 filed by the Respondent at this stage.

52. However, the Petitioner-Husband is at liberty to agitate his contentions on merit before the learned Metropolitan Magistrate who may consider the same and decide the Petition under Section 12 of the DV Act.

53. Accordingly, the present Petition along with pending Application(s), if any, is disposed of.

54. A separate Petition has also been filed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C on similar grounds for quashing of the FIR No.370/2021 dated 24.12.2021 registered under Sections 498A/323/506 and 34 of IPC, 1860, Police Station Maidan Garhi, Delhi, filed by Respondent, Alisha David.

55. The contents of the Complaint on which the present FIR was registered on 24.12.2021 are essentially identical to the averments as detailed above.

56. The Petitioner-Husband has submitted that there are no averments made out from the allegations made in the Complaint and no prima facie case is made out under Sections 498A/323/506/34 of IPC, 1860 and the FIR is liable to be quashed.

64. In the light of the aforesaid discussion, the facts of the present case may now be considered.

66. According to the Complainant Wife, she immediately thereafter went to reside in her matrimonial home in Mumbai along with her husband and mother-in-law. She asserted that during the initial meetings prior to October, 2014, the Petitioner-Husband and his family members appeared to be progressive and morally sound who claimed that they believed in simple living and high thinking. They were inclined in promoting education for women in the family and were against the dowry, gifts and flamboyant marriage with pomp and show. Impressed by their high moral values and character, she got married to the Petitioner-Husband. However, gradually, she saw these values starting to fade.

67. According to her averments made in the FIR, when she stepped into the matrimonial home, her Mother-in-Law started showing her quarrelsome nature towards her. The Mother-in-law and the Petitioner-Husband wanted to fetch more dowry. One day, the Petitioner-Husband called up the father of Respondent-Wife and disrespected him by saying demeaning things like he was getting much better proposals, but he thinks that he made a mistake by choosing this marriage proposal over the other one. He further made numerous derogatory statements amongst which was ""me and my family did not meet this social and financial status as we did not give costly gifts, jewellery and clothes and performed the marriage like paupers"". The mother-in-law also talked to her in a taunting manner and passed derogatory remarks towards her father in the presence of entire family by saying that ""what kind of a father would seek other people's help to get his daughter married, such people should in the first place not have children specially daughter"".

68. Such derogatory remarks made the Complainant-Wife feel very hurt and embarrassed before the entire family. Whenever she approached the Petitioner-Husband about such conduct of his mother or that her father was insulted in front of entire family, the Petitioner-Husband conveniently sided with his mother and told her not to interfere in whatever discussions happen between their respective parents.

69. The Petitioner-Husband also supported his mother by saying that his mother‟s opinion was not wrong and any respectable person would make sure that he is able to get the daughter married out of his own pocket according to the wishes of the family of the groom.

70. It is further asserted that the mother-in-law and the Petitioner- Husband also asked her to bring cash from her father as they wanted to buy a bigger house and a car. She, therefore, suggested that she would do a job and would give entire salary to them. She took the private job in July, 2015 but she conceived and eventually had to leave the job.

72. Furthermore, she also claimed that she told the Petitioner-Husband and the Mother-in-Law about her pregnancy, they instead of getting excited, retorted that they did not need child as they cannot afford the expenses of the child.

73. The Respondent-Wife further alleged that rather than taking care of her during her pregnancy, they mentally harassed her leading to her medical condition getting deteriorated. Left with no option, she went to live with her parents in Darjeeling on 06.11.2015. The child was born on 18.03.2016 and thereafter, she returned to the matrimonial home on her own in February, 2017.

74. According to the Complainant-Wife, when she gave the information about the birth of the child, the Petitioner-Husband came to see the baby finally on 19.03.2016, but not thereafter. She was then pressurised to return to Mumbai and was again pressurised to take up a job even though the son was barely 11 months old. When she expressed her disinclination, she was thrashed by the Petitioner-Husband on the instigation of the mother-in-law. She further claimed that every now and then, she was taunted and harassed on petty things and humiliated for not bringing sufficient dowry. At times, she was not given sufficient food and was told by the Mother-in-Law that the house belonged to her and not to the respondent.

76. The Complainant-Wife had further asserted that the Petitioner- Husband took her and their child to a rented accommodation on 16.02.2017 where they lived till 16.04.2017 i.e., for two months and thereafter returned to the matrimonial home for some time. Thereafter, she was thrown out along with her son at the instigation of the Mother-in-Law and Sister-in- Law. She repeatedly requested to return to matrimonial home as she was not in a position to pay the rent or bear the expenses of the child, but the conduct did not improve and cunningly got rid of the responsibility of the child and the Complainant-Wife.

77. She further claimed that she went to live with her friend, Sonal Dass at Thane. Her friend informed about her whereabouts to the Petitioner-

Husband, but he outrightly declined to take her back unless she rubbed her nose in the feet of the mother-in-law. She, therefore, decided to leave and went to Gurugram, Haryana along with the child to her brother‟s house on 02.06.2017. After sometime, she took a rented accommodation as there was little space in the brother‟s house.

78. She stated that on 10.05.2018, she along with her son went to the matrimonial home in Mumbai as the Petitioner-Husband had asked her to discuss the issues. The moment she reached Mumbai, the Petitioner- Husband snatched the child from her and threw her out from the house. She reported the matter to the local Police where they had lot of arguments and the Petitioner-Husband agreed to get the custody of the child for the two months from May to June, 2018 and to return the custody in first week of July, 2018. The Petitioner-Husband also promised not to object to her meeting the child. According to her, she visited the house of the Petitioner- Husband on 24.12.2018 to take the child back where she met the Sister-in- Law who had come to see the parents, but she shut the door on her face by saying that she did not know her and she would not let her meet the child unless the demands were fulfilled.

79. The Complainant-Wife had claimed that due to the humiliation and the stress, she suffered severe chest pain and went for a check up to Family Care Hospital, Mahim, Mumbai. She informed the hospital Authority to inform her husband, but he did not come to see her. In this regard, she has exhibited the Medical Document as Annexure R-3, whereby it has been written that she had complaint of Chest pain since evening. She had generalised weakness, whole body pain, no spike of fever, nausea/vomiting but no history of any major illness. She was prescribed some medicines. The medical document does not reflect that she was suffering from a ""stress attack"".

80. Thereafter, on 18.05.2020, the Petitioner-Husband filed a Custody Petition before the Family Court Bandra, Mumbai and she was dragged from Delhi to attend the proceedings at Mumbai during the COVID-19 period. She stayed in the matrimonial home and left along with the son on 01.10.2020. This also does not show any act of cruelty.

82. From all these averments even if they are admitted on the face value, what emerges is that the parties had matrimonial disputes, consequent to which the Complainant-Wife left the matrimonial home way back on 16.11.2015. Thereafter, she came to live in the matrimonial home for a little while in 2016 after the child was born and also during Covind-19 period. Thereafter, they tried to live together, but things did not work out.

83. It is clear that these are not specific averments of there being any dowry demands or of cruelty of the kind that would endanger the Respondent-Wife‟s life, limb or safety or would drive her to commit suicide. While she has asserted that there were dowry demands, but there is no specific dowry demand rather her own averment shows that the mother of the Petitioner-Husband was making remarks that if the father of the Respondent-Wife did not have enough money to marry the daughter, they should not have a daughter.

85. It is also pertinent to observe that the Custody Petition got filed by the Petitioner-Husband on 01.10.2020 which was responded by the Complainant-Wife by filing a Petition under Section 12 of DV Act on 17.12.2020 and thereafter, the Complaint before the CAW Cell on 09.12.2020. Clearly the initiation of the proceedings under the DV Act and Section 498A of IPC, 1860 are nothing but retaliatory action of the Complainant-Wife.

86. As has been discussed in the case of Digambar and Another, (supra) and other judgments as discussed above, there are no specific allegations of dowry harassment, beating or threats. All the averments made are vague and do not disclose any offence under Sections 498A/323/506/34 of IPC, 1860.

87. Accordingly, FIR No. 370/2021 under Sections 498A/323/506/34 of the IPC, 1860 registered at Police Station Maidan Garhi, Delhi along with the Chargesheet and all consequential proceedings emanating therefrom, is quashed.

88. The Petition stands disposed of along with pending Application(s).

Learned counsel for the applicants placed brief facts of the case, that on the basis of an order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Hapur on an application moved before the Chief Judicial Magistrate under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., a First Information Report3 was lodged on 16.03.2024 at 06:49 hrs. against the father-in-law Virendra Singh (applicant no. 1), mother-in-law Meenakshi Singh (applicant no. 2), Nanad Swati Singh (applicant no. 3) and Arjun Singh husband of the informant, stating that the informant is a law abiding and trustworthy woman, presently residing in Hapur and her permanent address is of Madhya Pradesh. She has detailed about the accused persons named in the FIR showing her relation with them. Informant's version in the FIR is that her marriage was solemnized with accused Arjun Singh on 25.06.2023 in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh. Thereafter, the marriage was registered before the Registrar, Marriages, Sadar-1, Hapur on 27.06.2023 through an application no. 202314100302. Said marriage was mediated by Sri Umesh Singh Chauhan +91-8770894052, resident of Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, wherein informant's husband Arjun Singh, aged about 34 years, was stated to be the resident of Toronto, Canada (425-221 Balliol Street, M4S1C8, Toronto) and it was also informed that Arjun Singh is the citizen of Canada and previously he had not performed any marriage. Copy of Canadian Passport No. A1887019 of Arjun Singh has been enclosed.

3.1 It is further stated in the FIR that 'Roka'/ engagement ceremony of the informant and Arjun Singh was performed on 11.12.2022, wherein informant's father gifted a gold chain (3.5 tola) to her husband, Rs. 11,000/- each to father-in-law and mother-in-law and Rs. 3100/- each to Nanad and her husband. After the engagement ceremony, Arjun Singh went back to Canada and no date of marriage was decided as it had to be fixed as per return schedule of Arjun Singh from Canada. After some time, marriage was slated for 25.06.2023. The informant, in the FIR, further alleges that while the marriage arrangements had been done by her father, her father-in-law called her father asking to spend at least Rs. 1 Crore in the marriage ceremony and specified the guests to whom cash envelops or gifts were to be presented, including the booking of hotel and other arrangements. While the informant's father raised objection over the demands stepped up by her father-in-law, he spoke that his son is a Canadian citizen and a number of persons are willing to spend Rs. 4 to 5 crore in the marriage. Under such compulsion, her father had to ensure the arrangements of marriage.

3.2 As per the FIR, the marriage was solemnized in Meghdoot Resort, Ujjain, wherein about Rs. 55 lakh were spent and ornaments of Rs. 8 lakh were also given by her father. Informant's father also gave her, gold and silver ornaments to the worth of Rs. 95 lakh. After vidaai she came to Hapur in the night at about 12 O'clock on 26.06.2023. The next morning to change her dress, when she tried to find the bag wherein the gold and silver ornaments gifted by her father and the ornaments given to her by her in-laws were kept, it was not there. On being asked about the said bag, her in-laws informed that all the valuables are in their custody and have been kept at safe place because of marriage in the family.

3.3 Further allegations in the FIR are that on 28.6.2023, after marriage reception which was staged in Surya Hotel, New Friends Colony, Delhi, they went to London on 01.07.2023. They lived there for about a month, where Arjun Singh forcefully did unnatural sex and sans condom stating that man's purpose is to spread his genes and he does not believe in using protection. Other than this, he got 10,000 pounds spent from her. The informant came to know that her husband is atheistic and eats beef despite belonging to Hindu religion. The informant realized changes in her husband's behaviour and noticed that he never left his mobile and use to send messages and had frequent conversations with someone.

3.4 The informant next alleges that she came back to India from London on 30.07.2023 while her husband went to Canada. The informant found out through the location shared to her by her husband, that her husband instead of living in his house, used to live at another address in the nearby building. On being inquired through her sources, the informant came to know that Arjun Singh has been residing with a woman, namely, Alfiya Shaheed Hasan, resident of 265 Balliol Street, M4S1C9 Toronto for the last 13 years in a house as husband and wife. Surprisingly, her father-in-law and mother-in-law were also well aware of the fact. Knowing about the said situation, on being asked by family, Arjun Singh came to India on 16.12.2023, whereafter some family members of both sides including the accused persons had some conversation, wherein Arjun Singh, his father and mother accepted about Arjun's relationship with Alfiya Shaheed Hasan for last 18 years, however, in-laws of the informant asked her to excuse them and start a new life with Arjun Singh, however, Arjun Singh conspicuously said that he cannot separate from Alfiya and the informant may go with him to Canada if she wants to live as his second wife. Hearing the said words, the informant, her parents and uncle (Taau) were astonished, however, her father-in-law and mother-law did not utter a word, which revealed that they were already knowing about the illicit relationship of their son.

3.5 Informant also alleged that while she started to pack her luggage to go with her parents from in-law's place, her husband, father-in-law and mother-in-law unitedly stopped her from carrying any article and even the informant was restrained from taking any personal belongings. It is further alleged that the accused persons are exerting pressure upon the informant asking her to live with the existing scenario and even Alfiya Shaheed Hasan is also calling and messaging the informant from Canada, and asking to send Arjun Singh to Canada soon. Copy of text messages sent by Alfiya Shaheed Hasan are appended. Further allegations in the FIR are that the accused persons have played fraud with the informant and her parents in order to take dowry, and Rs. 1.20 crore along with ornaments have also been taken into possession including clothings, gifts etc. amounting to Rs. 14 lakh. Informant has brought on record the evidences with respect to the aforementioned averments.

3.6 In the FIR, the informant states that in respect to the abovementioned facts, she had made a complaint in Mahila Thana, Hapur on 07.01.2024 and to the Senior Superintendent of Police on 12.01.2024, for taking appropriate action against the accused persons, however, nothing has been done, thus, she moved an application before the Chief Judicial Magistrate for taking action against husband - Arjun Singh, father-in-law - Virendra Singh, mother-in-law Meenakshi Singh and sister-in-law Swati Singh for illegal possession of Rs. 1.20 crore, criminal intimidation, dowry demand, for unnatural sex against husband, forgery and betrayal. She has suffered mentally and socially, thus, offence be registered under the relevant sections. Hence the present application. After moving the said application, on the order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, the FIR was lodged.

4. After investigation charge-sheet has been submitted against the accused persons and the applicants have been summoned by the order impugned dated 29.10.2024.

5. Learned Counsel for the parties have submitted their written submissions as permitted by this Court while the judgement was reserved. Same are taken on record.

6. Learned Counsel for the applicants submits that applicant nos. 1 & 2 are senior citizens (father in-law and mother-in-law of informant). Applicant No.3 is married sister-in-law and is residing in a different city, namely, Ghaziabad. They have been dragged into criminal proceedings stemming from a matrimonial discord between the informant (O.P. No.2) and her husband, Arjun Singh. Despite having no role, they are now facing proceedings under severe penal provisions, including Sections 498A, 307 IPC, 3/4 D.P. Act, etc. Only vague and general allegations are made against the entire family. Since husband is Canadian Citizen, the informant is harassing the family members of the husband.

6.1 In this continuous harassment, the informant has filed another FIR dated 29.11.2024 implicating the entire family under Section 406 IPC. In the said case, husband of Swati Singh (applicant no. 3) has also been implicated. Copy of said FIR has been brought on the record as Annexure No.SA-1 in second supplementary affidavit dated 16.03.2025.

6.2. Bringing the facts of the case before the Court, learned counsel for the applicants submits that on 28.11.2022, applicant No.3 Swati Singh was married to Atharva Sharma. To attend her marriage, husband of informant Arjun Singh was in India. On 11.12.2022, on the invitation of Umesh Singh Chauhan, a distant relative and neighbour of informant, applicants alongwith Arjun Singh (husband) went to Ujjain for the first meeting with the informant's family. Surprisingly the informant's family insisted for 'Roka' and performed the same despite unwillingness of applicants' family. On 25.06.2023, in a very hurried manner, the marriage was fixed. Applicants and others (total 40 persons) reached Ujjain on 24.06.2023 and came back on 26.06.2023 after marriage.

6.4 On 01.07.2023 the informant and husband went for honeymoon to London. On 31.07.2023 informant returned back to India as she was not having Canadian Visa, while her husband went back to Canada. In between 01.08.2023 to 22.12.2023, the informant remained in Hapur house only for 20 days and she used to fly frequently to Mumbai for undisclosed reasons. However, the family never objected.

6.5 On 16.12.2023 husband Arjun Singh came back to India and directly went to informant's house in Mumbai as informant was residing in Mumbai at that point of time. From there both went to Goa and on 20.12.2023 they came to Hapur from Goa. Then the applicants came to know that under the threat of informant, a tourist visa was also applied for the wife. This time, the informant was accompanied with 5 bodyguards.

6.6 On 22.12.2023, the informant left the in-laws' house permanently alongwith her parents and went to Mumbai. On 24.12.2023, the informant's husband went to Mumbai for solving the issues with her, however, it did not materialize. On 28.12.2023, Arjun Singh alone came back to his house in India and remained in Hapur till 18.01.2024. On 07.01.2024, first complaint was moved by the informant before the police, which was not registered. On 12.01.2024, she moved second complaint before the Senior Superintendent of Police, Hapur, that too was also not registered. Thereafter, on 23.01.2024 an application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. was filed.

6.7 Thereafter, pursuant to the order of the court concerned on the application filed by O.P. No. 2 under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., the first information report bearing Case Crime No. 191 of 2024 was lodged on 16.03.2024, under Sections 498A, 323, 377, 494, 420 IPC, and Section 3/4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, against the husband and his entire family including the applicants without any specific, direct, or credible allegation.

6.8 On 09.04.2024, medical examination was conducted in which no external injury was found and the informant refused for internal examination. On 09.04.2024, statements of the informant under Section 161 Cr.P.C. were recorded, in which she introduced another story against mother-in-law and married sister-in-law to make out offence under Section 307 IPC. On 12.04.2024, statements under Section 164 Cr.P.C. were recorded which contain no allegation under Section 307 IPC. The Investigating Officer4 has also recorded statements of other persons, i.e., the parents of informant who have also attempted to introduce the story of Section 307 IPC against applicant Nos. 2 & 3, only on the basis of hearsay evidence. On 20.04.2024, on the basis of available evidence, the I.O. expunged the name of Swati Singh and also expunged the alleged offence under Sections 377, 394 and 420 IPC and proceeded for investigation only against applicant Nos.1 and 2. and never added the offence under Section 307 IPC.

6.9 On the complaint of informant, the Investigating Officer was changed on 15.05.2024 and a new officer took over the charge of investigation. On 31.05.2024, the new Investigating Officer recorded the second statements of father of informant, mother of informant, mediator of marriage, namely, Umesh Singh Chauhan under Section 161 Cr.P.C. who have repeated the version of informant given under Section 161 Cr.P.C. No new evidence came on record. This Investigating Officer was transferred again. On 11.06.2024, again the third Investigating Officer, namely, Raghuraj Singh started the investigation and on the basis of evidence collected by Neeraj Kumar, as contained in Parcha No.10, added Section 307 IPC and also restored the offence under Sections 377, 394 and 420 IPC. Name of Swati Singh (applicant no. 3) was again added, (Parcha No.11). From 11.06.2024 till 19.08.2024, the investigating officer namely Raghuraj Singh has conducted the investigation and reduced the same from Parcha No. 11 to Parcha No. 19. He collected the below mentioned material:

i. Statement of Virendra Singh - applicant No.1 was recorded on 17.08.2024 who denied the charges.
ii. Statement of Meenakshi Singh - applicant No.2 was recorded on 17.08.2024 who denied the charges.
iii. Statement of Swati Singh - applicant No.3 was recorded on 17.08.2024 who denied the charges.
iv. Statement of Medical Officer was recorded on 17.08.2024 who denied the charges.
Thus, it is clear that no further evidence was collected in the investigation.
6.10 On 19.08.2024, the Investigation Officer on the basis of the available material submitted the charge sheet as detailed below:
1. Against applicant No.1 (Father-in-law) under Sections 498A, 323 IPC and 3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act.
2. Against applicant No.2 (Mother-in-law) under Sections 498A, 323, 307 IPC and 3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act.
3. Against applicant No.3 (married sister-in-law) under Sections 498A, 323, 307 IPC and 3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act.
6.11 However, the Circle Officer returned the charge sheet on 23.08.2024, raising specific issue that on what basis, Section 307 IPC was added and name of Swati Singh was included, which was already expunged. Said objection has been brought on record at Page 11 of supplementary affidavit dated 02.02.2025.
6.12 On 13.09.2024 pursuant to the aforesaid order of Circle Officer and since Raghuraj Singh, the earlier I.O., was transferred, the investigation was took over by new Investigating Officer on 13.09.2024. He conducted the investigation till 16.10.2024 which are contained in Parcha Nos. 20, 21 & 22. However, he did not collect any evidence. On 29.10.2024 without collecting any new evidence the same charge sheet dated 19.08.2024 was filed.
7. Learned counsel for the applicants has laid emphasis on the infirmities in evidences on record summarizing his submissions in the following manner:
7.1 The investigation process was tainted by inconsistency, arbitrariness, and bias. Repeated transfers of Investigating Officers created a fractured and inconsistent chain of investigation. No new evidence was gathered to justify the revival of dropped charges and improvements in statement is also evident.

7.2 The Circle Officer, Hapur clearly stated in its objection dated 23.08.2024, which has been brought on record as Annexure-12 to the petition that the chargesheet was filed without due diligence and without consideration of evidence. No explanation was offered for deviation from prior findings.

7.5 The Investigating Officers were frequently changed. I.O. - Anish Ahmad conducted a diligent probe and dropped severe charges, but successor I.O. Niraj Kumar added Sections 377 and 307 IPC without justification. I.O. Raghuraj Singh filed a charge-sheet despite clear objections of the Circle Officer dated 23.08.2024 regarding negligence.

8. Learned counsel for the applicants contends that a perusal of the evidence collected shows that no offence is made out against the applicants. He has framed his arguments on legal premises as follows:

A. Virendra Singh chargesheeted under Section 498A, 323 IPC & 3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act:
(i) There is no claim against Virendra Singh regarding any kind of demand of dowry rather the claim is only about the customary expenses and arrangements before marriage and of marriage i.e. Roka ceremony and wedding ceremony which are cultural practice and not any dowry demand. The ingredients required for invocation of Section 3/4 of Dowry Prohibition Act are absent.
(ii) Insofar as Section 498A is concerned, the essential ingredients are not made out as there is no averment pertaining to any 'cruelty' against Virendra Singh. No overt act is shown against Virendra Singh
(iii) Section 323 IPC is not made out as no allegation is in regard to causing any hurt resulting in bodily pain, disease or infirmity as provided in Section 319 IPC.
10. To strengthen his submissions learned counsel for the applicants has relied upon the following judgements of the Supreme Court:

A. State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal7:
Paragraph 108: ""Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.""
B. Sushil Kumar Sharma v. Union of India8:
Para 19: ""The object of the provision is prevention of the dowry menace. But as has been rightly contended by the petitioner, many instances have come to light where the complaints are not bona fide and have been filed with oblique motive. In such cases, the acquittal of the accused does not in all cases wipe out the ignominy suffered during and prior to trial. Sometimes adverse media coverage adds to the misery.""
C. Preeti Gupta v. State of Jharkhand9:
Para 30: ""It is a matter of common knowledge that exaggerated versions of the incident are reflected in a large number of complaints. The tendency of over-implication is also reflected in a very large number of cases.""
D. Geeta Mehrotra v. State of U.P.10 Para 20: Placing reliance upon paragraph-20 of the judgement of Supreme Court passed in Geeta Mehrotra (supra), learned counsel for the applicants submits that mere casual reference of the names of the family members in a matrimonial dispute without allegation of active involvement in the matter would not justify taking cognizance against them oblivious of the fact that they reside separately.""
E. Smt. Ruchi Tiwari v. State of U.P.11:
Para 15: ""In absence of specific allegations of demand of dowry made after marriage, and with no contemporaneous evidence, it cannot be said that a prima facie case under Sections 3/4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act is made out. Such general assertions do not satisfy the statutory requirements.""
F. Learned counsel for the applicants has also placed reliance on the judgements in the case of Kailash Chandra Agrawal vs. State of U.P. and others12 (Para 8-10); Pritam Ashok Sadafule vs. State of Maharashtra & others13, (Para 17 & 18); Varala Bharath Kumar vs. State of Telangana14 (Para 6-9); Kartik Chand Majee vs. State of Jharkhand & others15 (Para 9-11); Rajesh Sharma and others vs. State of U.P.16 (Para 14 & 15); K. Subbarao and others vs. State of Telangana17 (Para 5 to 8); Rashmi Chopra vs. State of U.P. and others18 (Para 24, 25, 27, 28 & 31) Seenivasan vs. State19 (Para 6-8); Kahkashan Kausar vs. State of Bihar20 (Para 10-18); Social Action Forum for Manav Adhikar and another vs. Union of India, Ministry of Law and Justice and others21, and Mohd. Akram Siddqui vs. State of Bihar and another22.
11. On the cumulative strength of the aforesaid submissions, it is submitted by learned counsel for the applicants that the proceedings of the criminal case pending against the applicants are liable to be quashed by this Court.

12. Learned counsel for O.P. No. 2 submits that the present applicants who are father-in-law, mother-in-law and sister-in-law, prior to the marriage have met with the informant and her family and have lured that Arjun Singh is unmarried and though being a Canadian citizen, he wants to marry an Indian Hindu girl, though it was well within their knowledge that he is already married with one Alfiya Shaheed Hasan in Canada.

12.1 The said misrepresentation by the applicants were made only to satisfy their thirst of dowry, which they knew that they will get if the informant agrees to marry, and also to gain social acceptance for their son in the society that their son is married to an Indian Hindu girl.

12.2 Learned counsel for O.P. No. 2 has placed forth the facts stating that 10 days' prior to marriage, applicant no.1 called the father of informant and asked to spend 1 Crore rupees in the marriage, thereafter marriage happened on 25.06.2023 at Meghdoot Resort, Ujjain in which 55 Lakhs were spent on arrangements and 95 Lakhs were spent on Jewellery.

12.3 After the informant came to know about the relation between the Alfiya and her husband, she confronted the applicants, but since they were already knowing it, they did nothing. On 22.12.2023 when the informant decided to leave her matrimonial house, the applicants denied to give any of her belongings. Prior to the marriage, the applicants were knowing that Arjun is married and settled in Canada and only in order to obtain dowry, the applicants through a conspiracy have cheated the informant.

12.4 Learned counsel for the O.P. No. 2 further contends that some relevant statements have not been annexed by the applicants while filing the present petition. He has drawn attention of the Court to Case Dairy Parcha No.10 dated 31.05.2024, statement of father of informant namely Ajay Huriya, mother Yogita Huriya and mediator Umesh Singh Chauhan whereby specific allegations have been raised against the applicant nos. 2 and 3 i.e. mother-in-law and sister-in-law, respectively, that they have tried to strangulate the informant and were demanding dowry from the informant and after which section 307 IPC was added by the investigating officer in the present case. The medical examination of the informant was conducted after the 110 days of the incident as the police did not bother to register the first information report of informant on time.

13. Legal premise, on which the learned counsel for O.P. No. 2 has advanced his submissions stating that the petition is devoid of merit are as follows:

13.1 The applicants only in order to get relief, has not approached this Court with clean hands, as 3 statements as contained in CD Parcha No.10 on basis of which the investigating officer of the present case has added Section 307 IPC against the applicant nos. 2 and 3 in the present case, have deliberately not been made part of present petition.
13.2 In the first information report apart from allegations as levelled against the absconding husband, namely, Arjun Singh, there are specific allegations against the applicants i.e father-in-law, mother-in-law and sister-in-law who are the main conspirators in the present case.
13.3 The applicants only in order to get dowry and gifts have cheated the informant and her family members, despite knowing the fact that their son Arjun Singh i.e. husband of informant is already married and settled in Canada. Through a premediated mind and by conspiring with each other, the applicants have first cheated her, then harassed the informant mentally and physically. Only because of money the applicants have ruined the life of the helpless informant who is a young lady, and now she is living on the mercy of her parents. Not only the husband but the applicants have also harassed the informant in order to fulfil their greed for the dowry 13.4 Perusal of statements of witnesses namely Sanjay Garg and Shailly Garg demonstrates that the witnesses are specifically stating that Alfiya is friend of Arjun Singh and they both have studied and working together, and as such the apprehension raised by the informant against her husband was not baseless rather based on concrete evidence.
13.5 The applicant nos. 1 & 2 have deliberately married their son Arjun Singh with the informant, only to get social acceptance here in India and to grab money in the form of dowry from the family of the informant. Statement of informant recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. specifically contains allegations against the applicants that after marriage when the informant demanded her jewellery, applicant no.2 pushed her and also on the pretext of dowry both sister-in-law and mother-in-law (applicant no.3 and 2) tried to strangulate the informant.
13.6 Statement of the informant recorded under Section 164 C.r.P.C. specifically raises allegations against the applicants that applicant no.1 was always demanding dowry from the father of informant, applicant no.2 misbehaved with informant when she complained about her husband, namely, Arjun Singh, also applicant nos. 2 and 3 were causing physical and mental harassment to the informant for bringing dowry less than their expectations. A perusal of statements of the informant, and her family members clearly demonstrate happening of cognizable offences and no benefit of the minor discrepancies in the statements of witnesses can be availed at this stage, as the appropriate forum to look after the factual aspects of the present case would be trial court.
13.7 The husband of informant namely Arjun Singh has absconded from India, against whom Look out Circular (LOC), Non-Bailable Warrants are issued by the trial court and there are high chances that the applicants would also escape from India as soon as they get relief from this Court. In the entire petition the applicants have failed to demonstrate that they have nothing to do with the husband of the informant, which itself proves their complicity in the present case.
13.8 Learned counsel for O.P. No. 2 further contends that from a perusal of the statements and material collected during investigation, a prima-facie case is made out against the applicants and the ground on which the applicants are seeking quashing of the present case cannot be seen herein through the present application filed under Section 528 of Bhartiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, inasmuch as there is remedy to file discharge application under Section 250 BNSS before the trial court. The Apex Court as well as this Court on numerous occasions have stated that while exercising the powers under the present jurisdiction i.e. 528 BNSS, formerly Section 482 Cr.P.C., this Court could not conduct mini trial.
13.9 After an exhaustive investigation, chargesheet has been filed against the applicants and as such it is only the trial court who can look at the evidence and try the applicants for the offences as alleged. This Court may not enter into the merits of the allegations as levelled by the prosecution, as it would amount to conduct a mini trial. Perusal of F.I.R. as well as statements of the witnesses, goes to show that, prima facie case for the alleged offence is made out against the applicants.
13.10 It is further contended by learned counsel for O.P. No. 2 that this Court cannot quash the entire criminal proceedings under the present jurisdiction Section i.e. Section 528 BNSS (formerly know as 482 Cr.P.C.) at the pre-trial stage, as held in the case of Mohd. Allauddin Khan vs. The State of Bihar & Others23, wherein the Apex Court has held that the High Court had no jurisdiction to appreciate the evidence of the proceedings under Section 482 Cr.P.C. because whether there are contradictions or/and inconsistencies in the statements of the witnesses is an essential issue relating to appreciation of evidence and the same can be gone into by the Judicial Magistrate during trial when the entire evidence is adduced by the parties. However, in the present case the said stage is yet to come.
13.11 Learned counsel appearing for O.P. No. 2 has further relied upon a judgement of the Apex Court in the matter of Rajeev Kaurav vs. Balasahab & Others24, wherein the it has been held that it is no more res integra that exercise of power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash a criminal proceeding is only when an allegation made in the F.I.R. or the charge sheet constitutes the ingredients of the offence/offences alleged. Interference by the High Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is to prevent the abuse of process of any law or Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. It is settled law that the evidence produced by the accused in his defence cannot be looked into by the Court, except in very exceptional circumstances.
14. Learned counsel for the O.P. No. 2 has relied upon the judgment of the Apex Court in case of Aluri Venkata Ramana vs. Aluri Thirupathi Rao & Ors.25, dated 12.12.2024, wherein the Apex Court has held thus:
""13. From the above ingredients reiterated by this Court, it is clear that an unlawful demand for dowry is not a prerequisite element to constitute ""cruelty under Section 498A IPC. It suffices that the conduct falls within either of the two broad categories outlined in clauses (a) or (b) of the provision, namely, wilful conduct likely to cause grave injury or mental harm (clause a), or harassment intended to coerce the woman or her family to meet any unlawful demand (clause b). Therefore, either form of cruelty. independent of a dowry demand, is sufficient to attract the provisions of Section 498A IPC and make the offence punishable under the law.""
16. Before this Court, the Respondents have contended that the wilful conduct described in clause (a) of the Explanation to Section 498A IPC should only be treated as cruelty if it is accompanied by a dowry demand as outlined in clause (b), or that an unlawful demand for property or valuable security, standing alone, constitutes cruelty under Section 498A. However, in light of the discussion above, it is evident that this submission is without merit and, therefore, is not accepted by this Court.""

25.6 Hence, in line with both the statutory language and the judicial pronouncements, this Court affirms that any form of property or valuable transfer associated with marriage, whether direct or indirect, express or implied, demanded or expected, and occurring at any point in time surrounding the marriage, constitutes dowry if the same is causally linked to the marriage transaction. Accordingly, the law must be enforced with sensitivity to the underlying coercive and oppressive practices that often masquerade as tradition or custom.

27. Coming to the facts of the present case, record shows that proceedings were initiated against the four named accused, including the applicants, through an application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C., whereby FIR was registered alleging therein that the marriage of O.P. No. 2 was solemnized with Arjun Singh on 25.06.2023 at Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, where one Umesh Singh Chauhan acted as a mediator for the alliance. The said marriage was registered on 27.06.2023. It has further been stated that Arjun Singh is a Canadian, who is presently residing in Toronto, Canada.

27.1 As per the allegations, the Roka ceremony took place on 11.12.2022, during which details of the gifts, including jewellery, were shared. Following the ceremony, the groom returned to Canada on 18.12.2022 as the final date of the marriage had not been decided at that time. However, the date was later, fixed for 25.06.2023. It is alleged that approximately ten days prior to the wedding, the father-in-law of O.P. No. 2 contacted her father and conveyed certain expectations. He demanded that an amount of rupees one crore be spent on the marriage. Additionally, he made inquiries about the amount of money to be placed in envelopes for the relatives, the jewellery to be presented, and arrangements regarding hotel bookings and other related expenses. The father of O.P. No. 2 raised an objection to such demands made by the father-in-law. At the time it was stated that others were willing to spend Rs. 4 to 5 crores, as his son is a Canadian citizen. Under such pressure, he had no option but to go by the wishes and demands of father-in-law of O.P. No.2. As a result, an amount of Rs. 55 lakhs was spent on a resort in Ujjain. In addition, various other expensive gifts and jewellery were given as per expectations and desires of the in-laws. After the marriage, the bride arrived in Hapur on 26th June 2023, around 12:00 midnight. The following day, she noticed that one of her bags containing jewellery was missing. Upon asking her in-laws, she was informed that they had safely kept it with them. On 28th June 2023, a wedding reception was held at Surya Hotel, New Friends Colony, Delhi.

27.2 The newly married couple departed for London on 1st July 2023, where they stayed for a month. During their stay, her husband Arjun Singh, despite his wife's objections, engaged in physical relations with her and never used any form of contraception. In addition to the aforementioned issues, it has been claimed that her husband compelled her to spend 10,000 pounds. Furthermore, it is alleged that he does not believe in God and often speaks only of a single deity. Despite identifying as a Hindu, he consumes beef. The O.P. No. 2 noticed changes in her husband's temperament and attitude. He frequently used his mobile phone for messaging and speaking with someone, and he never used to leave it unattended. On July 30, 2023, O.P. No. 2 had to return alone from London to India, while her husband travelled to Canada.

27.4 Upon learning the truth, the husband was called to India on 16th December 2023. On 21st December 2023, the girl's parents along with her uncle and other relatives went to Hapur for the purpose of mediation. During this meeting, the boy and his parents admitted to having knowledge of his long-standing relationship with Alfiya. However, all of them expressed regret for the aforementioned events and requested a fresh start for the couple. They urged Arjun and Simran to reconcile and begin a new life together. However, Arjun flatly refused. He stated that he could not leave Alfiya, and shockingly, proposed that Simran may accept the role of his second wife if she wishes to accompany him to Canada. Simran's relatives were deeply shocked and disturbed upon hearing this. In contrast, Arjun's parents remained completely silent, making it evident that they were fully aware of their son's relationship with Alfiya. On December 22, 2023, when the opposite party no. 2 chose to reside with her parents, the in-laws, including the husband, did not allow her to take her clothing and other personal belongings.

27.5 Since the O.P. No. 2 returned from Canada, all the accused persons, including Alfiya, have been consistently pressurizing her to remain in the same environment, atmosphere, and circumstances. They have also been urging her to return to Canada as soon as possible. Alfiya has sent multiple messages reinforcing this stance. The applicants, including the husband of O.P. No. 2, had a premeditated plan and intent to demand dowry. They solemnized the marriage between Opposite Party No. 2 and Arjun Singh with the intention to deceive. Their motive was to cheat both the O.P. No. 2 and her parents, thereby fraudulently obtaining a sum of approximately Rs. 1.20 crore in cash, along with jewellery and other valuable gifts, which are still in the possession of the applicants. To substantiate the allegations, audio and video recordings, medical bills, and various other documents demonstrating the relationship between Arjun Singh and Alfiya have also been submitted. A list of items provided by both parties have been documented and duly placed on record. An application/complaint was initially submitted before the concerned authority in Mahila Thana, Hapur, on 7th January 2024, and subsequently before the SSP on 12th January 2024, requesting for appropriate action against the alleged accused individuals. However, when no action was taken, the complaint was subsequently sent through registered post and speed post for further consideration.

28.1 The Investigating Officer, based on the evidence collected during the course of the investigation, stated that no offence was found to have been committed under Sections 377, 494, and 420 of the Indian Penal Code43. It was further recorded that the allegations against Ms. Swati Singh were found to be baseless, and consequently, her name was exonerated from the case. However, the investigation continued against the husband, father-in-law, and mother-in-law under Sections 498A, 323, IPC and 3/4 D.P. Act, as well as relevant provisions of the Dowry Prohibition Act.

28.2 It appears that following the transfer investigation, the General Diary (G.D.) entry dated 31st May 2024 mentions the addition of Section 307 of the IPC. This inclusion is based on the evidence collected up to that date.

28.3 Simran underwent a medical examination on 9th April 2024, which revealed no external injuries on her body. Furthermore, she declined to undergo an internal medical examination.

29. Considering the submissions as made by learned counsel for the parties and after looking into records, it is admitted position that there are three main allegations, for which the present case has been lodged. Firstly, anticipation of lavish and exorbitant expenditure in wedding arrangements to reflect societal inclination towards opulent and grandeur. The matter, in so many words, has been equated with an unlawful solicitation of dowry. Secondly, the applicants, despite being aware of Arjun's relationship with Alfiya, failed to disclose the same and even then the marriage had been solemnized for the purpose of taking dowry. Thirdly, mental and physical harassment by the applicants for the purposes of dowry.

44. From the aforementioned decisions it is clear that the courts have expressed concern over the misuse of Section 498A IPC and the increase of tendency of implicating relatives of the husband in matrimonial disputes, without analysing the long-term ramifications of a trial on the informant as well as the accused. It would not be out of place to state that the Apex Court by way of its numerous judgements has warned the courts from proceeding against the relatives and in-laws of the husband when no prima facie case is made out against them

46. In the present case, this Court finds that there are major contradictions regarding the expenditure for preparation of marriage as raised by the in-laws, in the version of the FIR and the statements recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. Secondly, there is no whisper of any allegation that the father of the girl was ever threatened or coerced, either explicitly or implicitly, to fulfil the purported demands regarding gifts to relatives, selection of the marriage venue according to someone else's preference, or bearing the marriage expenses. Furthermore, there is no assertion that the marriage was ever threatened to be cancelled in the event of non-fulfilment of such demands. Therefore, it cannot be reasonably concluded that the applicants were in any manner involved in making a demand for dowry.

49. The allegations made, seem to be driven more by a desire for retribution than by any genuine grievance. The FIR fails to disclose any concrete or precise accusation against the family members of the husband. There is an absence of specific details, such as the time, place, or the manner in which the alleged harassment took place.

50. Furthermore, the informant has not mentioned any particular instance of harassment with clarity. The statements recorded under Sections 161 and 164 Cr.P.C. also show notable discrepancies when compared with the FIR. These inconsistencies further weaken the prosecution's case and indicate that the allegations may not be trustworthy or credible.

53. From the written submissions presented by the counsel for both parties, it is evident that the couple spent four days together in Goa, from 16.12.2023 to 20.12.2023 without any reported incident of harassment. No allegations against the applicants have been mentioned beyond this period, which ultimately led to the filing of the present case.

55. When accusations are levelled against the husband's family members, it is important to assess whether these allegations are genuine or merely vague, omnibus claims lacking specific details such as dates, times, or concrete incidents. Allegations that are general in nature and unsupported by clear evidence should be scrutinized carefully, particularly when there are inconsistencies between the FIR and the woman's subsequent statements.

56. In between the period i.e. 01.07.2023 to 30.07.2023, when the O.P. No. 2 was enjoying with her husband, for one month, she has not made any allegation with respect to the applicants, from which also it is clear that the case has been lodged for unnecessary harassment of the applicants who are family members of the husband.

57. The issue of flaw in the investigation has also been touched upon by learned counsel for the parties. In this regard, it has been submitted by learned counsel for the applicants that initially certain sections were excluded and the allegations against sister-in-law were found to be unsubstantiated. However, after the change of Investigating Officer, sections like Section 307 IPC were reintroduced in the charge-sheet despite absence of credible evidence.

60. As previously discussed, the inclusion of the sister-in-law's name as an accused in the charge-sheet, along with the addition of an offence under Section 307 IPC at the time of filing the charge-sheet, constitutes sufficient grounds to quash the charge-sheet as it reflects a flaw in the investigation.

61. Given the totality of the facts and circumstances, the judgements as relied upon, arguments of learned counsel for the parties including their written submissions and the settled position of law in matrimonial cases, this Court is of the considered opinion that the allegations as made against the family members of the husband, who are the applicants herein, are insufficient and, prima facie, do not make out a case against the applicants. Further, they are so farfetched and improbable that no prudent person can conclude that there are sufficient grounds to proceed against them. In effect, the case in hand falls squarely under the Categories (1), (5) and (7) set out in the case of State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal68, thus, it is a fit case to exercise inherent powers under Section 528 BNSS (482 Cr.P.C.). Accordingly, the order impugned dated 29.10.2024, up to the extent of summoning the applicant no.1 under Sections 498-A, 323 I.P.C. and Section 3/4 D.P. Act, and applicant nos. 2 and 3 under Sections 498-A, 323, 307 I.P.C. and Section 3/4 D.P. Act, charge sheet dated 19.08.2024 and proceeding of Case No.14793 of 202469, arising out of Case Crime No. 191 of 2024, Police Station- Hapur Nagar, District- Hapur, against the applicants, pending in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Hapur, are quashed.

62. Needless to say that this Court has not commented upon the husband, who is a Canadian Citizen and it is open for the O.P. No. 2 to proceed against him, if she thinks fit.

63. The present application stands allowed accordingly.

The present appeal is directed against the judgment of conviction dated 29.05.2015 and order of sentence dated 03.07.2015, passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge III, Kangra, at Dharamshala, Camp at Baijnath, District Kangra, Himachal Pradesh (learned Trial Court) (Parties shall hereinafter be referred to in the same manner as they were arrayed before the learned Trial Court for convenience.) Whether reporters of Local Papers may be allowed to see the judgment? Yes.

( 2025:HHC:25967 )

2. Briefly stated, the facts giving rise to the present appeal are that the police presented a challan against the .

accused for the commission of offences punishable under Sections 498A and 306 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). It was asserted that Lachman Dass (PW1) had one daughter, Rama Devi (since deceased), and one son, Rakesh Kumar (PW2). The marriage of Rama Devi was solemnised with accused Gurcharan Singh as per Hindu Rites and Customs on 30.11.2007. One child was born to Rama Devi and the accused Gurcharan Singh. The accused Gurcharan and his mother, Ishro Devi, treated her properly for about two years, but they started harassing her subsequently. Rama Devi visited her parental home 15 days before her death and disclosed that her husband and her mother-in-law were harassing her and not permitting her to call her parents. She left her parental home after 2-3 days.

Sakeena Devi (PW3) told the informant, Lachman Das (PW1), on 14.04.2010 at about 12:30 pm, that Rama Devi had expired. The informant and other relatives went to the matrimonial home of Rama Devi, where they were told that Rama Devi had committed suicide by hanging herself. An intimation was given to the police, and an entry No.26(A) (Ex-PA) was recorded in the Police ( 2025:HHC:25967 ) Station. SI Inder Singh (PW12), HHC Amarjeet Singh (PW7), LC Prita Devi, HHC Ranjit Singh and HHC Desh Raj went to the spot .

for verification. Lachman Dass (PW1) made a statement (Ex-

PW1/A) to the police, which was sent to the Police Station where FIR (Ex-PW1/B) was registered. The photographs of the spot (Ex-P1 to P7) were taken. SI Inder Singh (PW12) conducted the investigation. He prepared the spot map (Ex-PW12/B). He conducted the inquest on the dead body and prepared the report (Ex-PW12/C). He filed an application(Ex-PW9/A) for conducting the postmortem examination of deceased Rama Devi. Dr. Mohit Sharma (PW9) conducted the postmortem examination and found that the cause of death was asphyxia by antemortem hanging. SI Inder Singh (PW12) found a suicide note written on the left arm of the deceased. A plastic rope (Ex-P8) was found, which was taken into possession vide memo (Ex-PW2/A). The rope was put in a cloth parcel, and the parcel was sealed with 06 seals of seal ""T"". Its seal impression (Ex-PW2/B) was taken on a separate piece of cloth, and the seal was handed over to Ajay Sharma after use. Rakesh Kumar (PW2) produced the admitted handwriting of the deceased (Ex-PW2/C), which was seized vide seizure memo (Ex-PW2/D). The questioned handwriting ( 2025:HHC:25967 ) contained in the photographs (Ex-P1 to P7) was sent to RFSL, Dharamshala, for comparison. A report (Ex-PB) was issued .

stating that the disputed handwriting matched the admitted handwriting of the deceased. No poison/alcohol was found in the viscera sent to RFSL, Dharamshala, and a report (Ex-PW9/C) was issued to this effect. As per report (Ex-PW9/D), the plastic rope could easily bear the weight of an average adult human being. The statements of witnesses were recorded as per their version, and after the completion of the investigation, the challan was prepared and presented before the Court of learned Judicial Magistrate First Class -I, Palampur, District Kangra, H.P., who committed it to the learned Sessions Judge, Kangra, at Dharamshala. Learned Sessions Judge, Kangra, at Dharamshala assigned the matter to learned Additional Sessions Judge - 3, Kangra, at Dharamshala (learned Trial Court) for trial.

3. The learned Trial Court charged the accused with the commission of offences punishable under Sections 498A and 306 read with Section 34 of the IPC, to which the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

( 2025:HHC:25967 )

4. The prosecution examined 12 witnesses to prove its case. Lachhman Dass (PW1) is the father, Rakesh Kumar (PW2) .

is the brother, and Sakeena (PW3) is the sister-in-law of deceased Rama Devi. Udho Ram (PW4) is the witness of the recovery of the admitted handwriting. Ajay Sharma (PW5) is the witness to the recovery of the rope. Constable Suresh Kumar (PW6) carried samples to RFSL, Dharamshala vide RC No.69/21.

HHC Amarjeet Singh (PW7) carried the sample to RFSL, Mandi vide RC No. 65/21. Puni Chand No.133 (PW8) was working as MHC with whom the case property was deposited. Dr. Mohit Sharma (PW9) conducted the postmortem examination of deceased Rama Devi. Inspector Joginder Singh (PW10) prepared the challan. Ajay Kumar (PW11) took the photographs. SI Inder Singh, SHO (PW12), conducted the investigation.

5. The accused, in their statements recorded under Section 313 of Cr.P.C., admitted the relationship between them and Rama Devi. They stated that they were innocent and were falsely implicated. No evidence was produced by the accused.

her on her left hand. The handwriting on the suicide note matched the admitted handwriting. Rama Devi committed suicide within 2½ years of her marriage, and the presumption under Section 113A of the Indian Evidence Act would arise. No evidence was led by the accused to rebut this presumption;

therefore, the learned Trial Court convicted the accused, Ishro Devi, for the commission of offences punishable under Sections 498A and 306 of the IPC and sentenced her as under:-

Under Section 306 of IPC To undergo simple imprisonment for three years, pay fine of ₹10,000/-, and in default of payment of fine, to undergo further simple imprisonment for two months.
Under Section 498-A of IPC To undergo simple imprisonment for one year, pay a fine of ₹5,000/-, and in default of payment of fine, to undergo further simple imprisonment for one month.
The substantive sentences of imprisonment were directed to run concurrently.
( 2025:HHC:25967 )
7. Being aggrieved by the judgment and order passed by the learned Trial Court, the accused has filed the present appeal, .

asserting that the learned Trial Court failed to appreciate that Rama Devi and her husband Ashwani Kumar (sic) were residing happily. She never made any complaint to any person regarding the harassment. No dowry was demanded by the accused at the time of her marriage. No reason for maltreatment was assigned by the prosecution witnesses. The neighbours and Pradhan did not state about any complaint made by Rama Devi during her lifetime. The statements made by the witnesses were vague, and they did not mention any time, date or specific demand.

Therefore, it was prayed that the present appeal be allowed and the judgment and order passed by the learned Trial Court be set aside.

8. I have heard M/s. Dushyant Dadwal & Shashwat Dadwal, learned counsel for the appellant, and Mr Jitender Sharma, learned Additional Advocate General, for the respondent-State.

9. Mr. Dushyant Dadwal, learned counsel for the appellant, submitted that the learned Trial Court erred in ( 2025:HHC:25967 ) convicting and sentencing the accused. The statements made by the witnesses were general in nature. No reason for the .

harassment was given. It is highly unlikely that the deceased would have been sent to her matrimonial home after she had complained about the harassment to her family members.

Therefore, he prayed that the present appeal be allowed and the judgment and order passed by the learned Trial Court be set aside.

10. Mr. Jitender Sharma, learned Additional Advocate General, for the respondent-State, submitted that the report submitted by the Handwriting Expert is per se admissible under Section 293 of Cr.PC, and there was no requirement to examine the Handwriting Expert. The witnesses consistently stated about the harassment. Even Ajay Sharma (PW5) who is Pradhan at the relevant time specifically stated that a complaint of harassment was made to him by complainant Lachhman Dass (PW1) during the lifetime of Rama Devi. The evidence on the record showed that the accused had treated the deceased with cruelty, and the ( 2025:HHC:25967 ) deceased had no other option but to commit suicide; hence, he prayed that the present appeal be dismissed.

.

11. I have given considerable thought to the submissions made at the bar and have gone through the records carefully.

13. Thus, no reliance can be placed upon the report of the Handwriting Analyst without his examination, and the learned Trial Court erred in relying upon the report to record the conviction.

14. The statement (Ex-PW1/A) reads that the deceased visited her parental home 15 days before her death and revealed that her mother-in-law and husband did not permit her to call her parental home, and she was being threatened. She left her matrimonial home after 2-3 days. Subsequently, she committed suicide.

10. When we see the complaint, the complaint is sadly vague. It does not show as to which accused has committed what offence, and what is the exact role played by these appellants is in the commission of the offence. There could be said that something is against Rajesh, as the allegations are made against him more precisely, but he is no more and has already expired. Under such circumstances, it would be an abuse of the process of law to allow the prosecution to continue against the aged parents of Rajesh, the present appellants herein, on the basis of a vague and general complaint which is silent about the precise acts of the appellants."" (Emphasis supplied)

""18. The plain reading of the FIR and the chargesheet papers indicates that the allegations levelled by the First Informant are quite vague, general and sweeping, specifying no instances of criminal conduct. It is also pertinent to note that in the FIR, no specific date or time of the alleged offence/offences has been disclosed. Even the police thought it fit to drop the proceedings against the other members of the Appellants' family. Thus, we are of the view that the FIR lodged by Respondent No. 2 was ( 2025:HHC:25967 ) nothing but a counterblast to the divorce petition & also the domestic violence case.

general and sweeping allegations without bringing on record any specific instances of criminal conduct, it is nothing but an abuse of the process of the court. The court owes a duty to subject the allegations levelled in the complaint to thorough scrutiny to find out, prima facie, whether there is any grain of truth in the allegations or whether they are made only with the sole object of involving certain individuals in a criminal charge, more particularly when a prosecution arises from a matrimonial dispute."" (Emphasis supplied)

general and omnibus in nature; even if they are taken in their entirety, they do not prima facie make out a case against the Appellants. The material on record neither discloses any particulars of the offences alleged nor discloses the specific role/allegations assigned to any of the Appellants in the commission of the offences.

Furthermore, no specific and distinct allegations have been made against either of the appellants herein, i.e. none of the appellants has been attributed any specific role in furtherance of the general allegations made against them. This simply leads to a situation wherein one fails to ascertain the role played by each accused in furtherance of the offence. The allegations are, therefore, general and omnibus and can, at best, be said to have been made out on account of small skirmishes...

24. The statements of the witnesses on oath are also vague. Lachhman Das (PW1) stated that his daughter told him many times about ill-treatment and torture by both the accused.

He consoled her and sent her to her matrimonial home. Rakesh Kumar (PW2) stated that Rama Devi told him so many times regarding the ill-treatment and torture given by the accused. He consoled her and sent her to her matrimonial home. Sakeena (PW3) stated that Rama Devi was being tortured by the accused Gurcharan Singh and his mother. Rama Devi has told so many times about the ill-treatment and torture given by the accused persons.

26. Lachhman Dass (PW1) admitted that no dowry was demanded by the accused persons at the time of the marriage.

Marriage was simple. Rakesh Kumar (PW2) also stated that no dowry or money was demanded by the accused. No condition ( 2025:HHC:25967 ) was imposed by the accused at the time of the marriage. It was a simple marriage. Sakeena (PW3) also admitted that no dowry or .

27. No reason has been assigned by any of the witnesses as to why the accused would suddenly start demanding the dowry, when they had not demanded anything at the time of the marriage. Therefore, their statements regarding the harassment of the deceased could not have been relied upon.

28. Udho Ram (PW4) is the neighbour. He did not state anything about the harassment of the deceased. Ajay Sharma (PW5) stated that the informant came to him and told him that the accused were torturing and maltreating his daughter. He stated that he would go to the matrimonial home of the deceased. He admitted in his cross-examination that no complaint was made in writing. He did not go to the matrimonial home to verify the allegations. His statement shows that the same is hearsay and insufficient to convict the accused.

the prosecution is required to prove that the accused had created such circumstances that the deceased was left with no other option but to commit suicide. It was observed:

""17. This Court in Geo Varghese v. State of Rajasthan [Geo Varghese v. State of Rajasthan, (2021) 19 SCC 144], considering the provisions of Section 306 IPC along with the definition of abetment under Section 107 IPC, observed as under: (SCC pp. 149-50, paras 14-16) ""14. Section 306IPC makes abetment of suicide a criminal offence and prescribes punishment for the same. ...
15. The ordinary dictionary meaning of the word ""instigate"" is to bring about or initiate, incite someone to do something. This Court in Ramesh Kumar v. State of Chhattisgarh [Ramesh Kumar v. State of Chhattisgarh, (2001) 9 SCC 618: 2002 SCC (Cri) 1088], has defined the word ""instigate"" as under : (SCC p. 629, para 20) '20. Instigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or encourage to do ""an act"".'
16. The scope and ambit of Section 107 IPC and its correlation with Section 306 IPC have been discussed repeatedly by this Court. In S.S. Chheena v. Vijay Kumar Mahajan [S.S. Chheena v. Vijay Kumar Mahajan, (2010) 12 SCC 190 : (2011) 2 SCC (Cri) 465], it was observed as under : (SCC p. 197, para 25) '25. Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a person in doing a thing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or ( 2025:HHC:25967 ) aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained. The intention of the legislature and the ratio of the cases decided by the .
abetment of suicide, remains a vexed one involving multifaceted and complex attributes of human behaviour and responses/reactions. In the case of an accusation of abetment of suicide, the court would be looking for cogent and convincing proof of the act(s) of incitement to the commission of suicide. In the case of suicide, a mere allegation of harassment of the deceased by another person would not suffice unless there be such action on the part of the accused which compels the person to commit suicide, and such an offending action ought to be proximate to the time of occurrence. Whether a person has abetted in the commission of suicide by another or not could only be gathered from the facts and circumstances of each case.

16.1. For the purpose of finding out if a person has abetted the commission of suicide by another, the consideration would be if the accused is guilty of the act of instigation of the act of suicide. As explained and reiterated by this Court in the decisions above referred, instigation means to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or encourage to do an act. If the persons who committed suicide had been hypersensitive and the action of the accused is otherwise not ordinarily expected to induce a similarly circumstanced person to commit suicide, it may not be safe to hold the accused guilty of abetment of suicide. But, on the other hand, if the accused, by his acts and by his continuous course of conduct, creates a situation which leads the deceased to perceive no other option except to commit suicide, the case may fall within the four corners of Section 306 IPC. If the accused plays an active role in tarnishing the self-esteem and self- respect of the victim, which eventually draws the ( 2025:HHC:25967 ) victim to commit suicide, the accused may be held guilty of abetment of suicide. The question of mens rea on the part of the accused in such cases would .

be examined with reference to the actual acts and deeds of the accused and if the acts and deeds are only of such nature where the accused intended nothing more than harassment or snap show of anger, a particular case may fall short of the offence of abetment of suicide. However, if the accused kept on irritating or annoying the deceased by words or deeds until the deceased reacted or was provoked, a particular case may be that of abetment of suicide. Such being the matter of delicate analysis of human behaviour, each case is required to be examined on its own facts while taking note of all the surrounding factors having bearing on the actions and psyche of the accused and the deceased.""

.

The most serious level of culpability, justifying the most serious levels of punishment, is achieved when both these components are actually present in the accused's mind (a ""subjective"" test).

( 2025:HHC:25967 ) Under Section 8(b), therefore, the jury is allowed wide latitude in applying a hybrid test to impute intent or foresight on the basis of all the evidence.

.

tion 309 IPC says that whoever attempts to commit sui-

cide and does any act towards such an act shall be pun- ished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with a fine or with both. However, once suicide is carried out, the offence is complete. Con- sidering the nature of the offence, obviously, such a per-

(ii) that the accused had the intention to provoke, urge or encourage the deceased to commit suicide while acting in the manner noted above.

Undoubtedly, the presence of mens rea is the necessary concomitant of instigation.

( 2025:HHC:25967 )

committed suicide. The act attributed should not only be proximate to the time of suicide but should also be of such a nature that the deceased was left with no alterna- tive but to take the drastic step of committing suicide.

( 2025:HHC:25967 )

31. In the present case, the evidence on record is insufficient to conclude that the accused had created such .

circumstances that the deceased was left with no other option but to commit suicide.

31. In this appeal, we are concerned with Section 113-A of the Evidence Act. The mere fact that the deceased committed suicide within a period of seven years of her marriage, the presumption under Section 113-A of the Evidence Act, would not automatically apply. The legislative mandate is that where a woman commits ( 2025:HHC:25967 ) suicide within seven years of her marriage, and it is shown that her husband or any relative of her husband had subjected her to cruelty, the presumption under .

33. The court should be extremely careful in assessing evidence under Section 113-A to finding out if cruelty was meted out. If it transpires that a victim committing suicide was hypersensitive to ordinary petulance, discord and differences in domestic life quite common to the society to which the victim belonged and such petulance, discord and differences were not expected to induce a similarly circumstanced individual in a given society to commit suicide, the conscience of the court would not be satisfied for holding that the accused charged of abetting the offence of suicide was guilty.

35. This Court has held that from the mere fact of suicide within seven years of marriage, one should not jump to the conclusion of abetment unless cruelty was proved.

which is an additional safeguard.

33. In the present case, the evidence regarding the cruelty is not satisfactory, and no reliance can be placed upon

34.

Learned Trial Court was influenced by the suicide note, which was inadmissible without the examination of the handwriting expert, and the judgment passed by the learned Trial Court cannot be sustained.

35. In view of the above, the present appeal is allowed and the judgment and order passed by the learned Trial Court are ordered to be set aside. The accused is acquitted of the commission of the charged offences. The fine amount, if deposited, be refunded to the accused after the expiry of period of limitation and in case of appeal, the same be dealt with as per the order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court.

36. In view of the provisions of Section 437-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Section 481 of Bhartiya Nagarik Suraksha ( 2025:HHC:25967 ) Sanhita, 2023), the appellant is directed to furnish bail bonds in the sum of ₹50,000/- with one surety of the like amount to the .

satisfaction of the learned Trial Court which shall be effective for six months with a stipulation that in an event of a Special Leave Petition being filed against this judgment or on grant of the leave, the appellant on receipt of notice thereof shall appear before the Hon'ble Supreme Court.

37. The present appeal stands disposed of, so also the pending miscellaneous application(s), if any.

38. A copy of the judgment, along with records of the learned Trial Court, be sent back forthwith.

Dayanand Sonkar vs State Of Chhattisgarh on 4 August, 2025
(Cause-title is taken from Case Information System) For Applicants : Mr. Pushkar Sinha, Advocate For Respondent/State : Mr. Hariom Rai, PL For Respondent No. 2 : Mr. Avinash Chand Sahu, Advocate Hon'ble Mr. Ramesh Sinha, Chief Justice Hon'ble Mr. Bibhu Datta Guru, Judge Order on Board Per Ramesh Sinha, Chief Justice 04/08/2025

1. Heard Mr. Pushkar Sinha, learned counsel for the applicants, Mr. Hariom Rai, learned Panel Lawyer for the State/respondent No. 1 as well as Mr. Avinash Chand Sahu, learned counsel for the respondent No. 2.

2. By this petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the applicants have made following prayer:-

""It is therefore, most respectfully prayed that this Hon'ble Court in exercise of its inherent powers under Section 528 of B.N.S.S may kindly be pleased to allow this petition and quash the entire criminal proceeding of Criminal Case No. 1126/2024, pending before the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Janjgir, initiated under the Crime No. 170/2024 registered at Police Station Janjgir, Distt. Janjgir-Champa dated 05.03.2024 and the Charge Sheet (Final Report) bearing No. 298/2024 dated 13.07.2024 and also against the charges framed against the petitioners vide order dated 13.11.2024 in Criminal Case No. 1126/2024 by the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Janjgir, District- Janjgir- Champa whereby the charges U/s 294, 323, 506, 498-A, 34 of I.P.C has been framed against the petitioners, in the interest of justice. Any other order that may be deemed fit and just on the fact and circumstances of the case may also kindly be passed in the interest of justice.""
3. The facts, in brief, as projected by the petitioners are that respondent no. 2 lodged a written report and alleged that she was given ill treatment by her husband and in laws and demanded for dowry just after the marriage and even at the time of marriage her father had given Rs.1,50,000/- cash amount, Wagon R car along with gold and silver ornaments and other articles to the husband, but still after the marriage, her in-laws were always complained to her that whatever articles she brought from her parental house are below standard and they were demand for more money from her parental house, and due to that her husband started beaten her and thereby she was tortured physically and mentally by the husband and his family members. She further alleged that her husband has illegal relationship with another woman and when complainant objected about this then her husband and family members physically tortured to her. On 04.03.2024 on the demand of dowry, her husband utter filthy languages and committed Marpeet with her and due to that on 05/03/2024, she had lodged report against the husband and offence under section 294, 506, 323 of IPC has been registered against the husband of complainant at Police Station Janjgir. Thereafter, the complainant filed written complaint before Mahila Thana, Bhilai and upon the written complaint filed by complainant offence has been registered u/s - 294, 506, 323, 498-A r/w 34 of IPC against the applicants in the final report.

4. It has been argued by learned counsel for the applicant No. 1 No.1 is husband of respondent No.2, and applicants No. 2 & 3 are father-in-law and mother-in-law of the complainant, respectively and applicant no. 4 is sister-in-law of her. He would submit that initially at the of lodging the first FIR, applicants No. 2 to 4 were not made accused, but later with malafide intention, they have been made an accused in false and frivolous case.

5. On the other hand, learned counsel appearing for respondent No.2 has submitted that the matter was referred to the Mediation Center by this Court, however, mediation between the parties has failed.

6. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the documents appended with petition.

32. We, therefore, are of the opinion that the impugned FIR No.82 of 2022 filed by respondent No.2 was initiated with ulterior motives to settle personal scores and grudges against appellant No.1 and his family members i.e., appellant Nos.2 to 6 herein. Hence, the present case at hand falls within category (7) of illustrative parameters highlighted in Bhajan Lal. Therefore, the High Court, in the present case, erred in not exercising the powers available to it under Section 482 CrPC and thereby failed to prevent abuse of the Court's process by continuing the criminal prosecution against the appellants."" Observing the aforesaid, the Apex Court quashed the FIR, the charge sheet and the consequential criminal proceedings pending before the learned trial Court.

12. In the complaint so made, the complainant has only made omnibus and general allegations against the applicants without being full particulars about date and place that all the applicants including the husband treated her with cruelty for not bringing dowry. There is no specific allegation regarding anyone of the applicants except common and general allegations against all them that they have demanded dowry.

13. Considering the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties, material available on record, perusing the FIR in which no specific allegations have been made and only bald and omnibus allegations have been made against the applicants, we are of the considered opinion that prima-facie no offence under Section 498A/34 of the IPC is made out for prosecuting applicant No. 2- Sonauram Sonkar, applicant No. 3- Parwati Sonkar and applicant No. 3- Chanchal Sonkar for the above- stated offences.

14. As a fallout and consequence of the above-stated legal analysis, Criminal Case No.1126/2024 pending in the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class, Janjgir (Chhattisgarh) arising out of Crime No.170/2024 registered at Police Station Janjgir-Champa, District Janjgir is hereby quashed to the extent of applicant No. 2- Sonauram Sonkar, applicant No. 3- Parwati Sonkar and applicant No. 3- Chanchal Sonkar. Prosecution against her husband applicant No.1- Dayanand Sonkar shall continue. Concerned trial Court will decide criminal case pending against applicant No.1- Dayanand Sonkar strictly in accordance with law without being influenced by any of these observations made hereinabove.

15. The petition under Section 482 CrPC is allowed to the extent indicated hereinabove. No cost(s).

Bagda Ram vs State Of Rajasthan ... on 4 August, 2025
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAVI CHIRANIA Order 04/08/2025

1. The appellant-applicant herein has been convicted and sentenced as below vide judgment dated 31.01.2020 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Bhinmal, District Jalore in Sessions Case No.17/2015 :


Offence U/s Sentence                         Fine                   Sentence in
                                                                    default of payment
                                                                    of fine

498A IPC       3 years RI                    Rs.3,000/-             3 months RI



2. The appellant-applicant has preferred this third application for suspension of sentence under Section 389 Cr.P.C. (430 of [2025:RJ-JD:34205-DB] (2 of 5) [SOSA-1404/2025] BNSS) for suspension of sentence during the pendency of the appeal and for release on bail.

3. The only plea raised by learned counsel for the appellant- applicant is that as the applicant is in custody for more than 10 years and there is no chance of hearing of the appeal in near future, thus, in view of the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 15.09.2022 in Sonadhar v. The State of Chhattisgarh : SLP (Crl.) No.529/2021, the sentence of the applicant be suspended and he be enlarged on bail.

5. Learned Additional Advocate General opposed the application for suspension of sentence with the submission that as the appellant-applicant has committed heinous offence, suspension of sentence of such offender would send adverse message in the society. However, he has not denied that the appellant-applicant has already undergone sentence of more than 10 years during trial and after sentence.

6. We have considered the submissions made by learned counsel for the parties and have perused the material available on record.

7. Looking to the fact that criminal appeals pertaining to year 2008 also are pending for hearing, there is no likelihood of hearing of the present appeal in near future.

10. In the present case as observed herein-before, the appellant- applicant has already undergone sentence for more than 10 years and apparently, there are no chances of hearing of the present appeal in near future. Except for the fact that the appellant- applicant was involved in offence leading to his conviction for life, nothing has been brought on record by way of extenuating circumstances for denial of suspension of sentence. [2025:RJ-JD:34205-DB] (4 of 5) [SOSA-1404/2025]

12. Accordingly, the instant third application for suspension of sentence filed under Section 389 Cr.P.C. (430 of BNSS) is allowed and it is ordered that substantive sentence passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Bhinmal, District Jalore vide judgment dated 31.01.2020 in Sessions Case No.17/2015, against the appellant-applicant, namely, Bagda Ram S/o Shri Naagji Ram @ Kalaram shall remain suspended till final disposal of the aforesaid appeal and he shall be released on bail, provided he executes a personal bond in the sum of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties of Rs.25,000/- each to the satisfaction of learned trial Judge for his appearance in this court on 03.09.2025 and whenever ordered to do so till the disposal of the appeal on the conditions indicated below:

1. That he will appear before the trial court in the month of January of every year till the appeal is decided.
2. That if the applicant change the place of residence, he will give in writing his changed address to the trial Court as well as to the counsel in the High Court.
3. Similarly, if the sureties change their address(s), they will give in writing their changed address to the trial court.
13. The learned trial court shall keep the record of attendance of the accused-applicant in a separate file. Such file be registered as Criminal Misc. Case relating to original case in which the accused-

[2025:RJ-JD:34205-DB] (5 of 5) [SOSA-1404/2025] applicant was tried and convicted. A copy of this order shall also be placed in that file for ready reference.

In case, the said accused-applicant does not appear before the trial court, learned trial Judge shall report the matter to the High Court for cancellation of bail.

Rajendrabhai Hargovandas Modi vs State Of Gujarat on 4 August, 2025
[1.0] By way of this petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India read with Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the petitioners have prayed to quash and set aside the FIR being CR No.11206075220444 of 2022 registered with Visnagar Town Police Station, District Mehsana for the offences punishable under Sections 498(A), 504, 506(2) and 114 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short ""IPC"") alongwith all the consequential proceedings arising therefrom.

[2.0] The complainant - respondent no.2 appeared in person before the Court and tenders her affidavit with regard to settlement which is taken on record.

[3.0] Going through the impugned FIR and investigation papers, it appears that the petitioner no.1 is father-in-law and petitioner no.2 is mother-in-law of respondent No.2 and impugned FIR is filed by respondent no.2 alleging mental and physical harassment meted upon respondent no.2. However, now the dispute is settled between the NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/10135/2022 ORDER DATED: 04/08/2025 undefined parties. Therefore, present petition deserves consideration.

[4.0] Further, it would be apposite to refer to the decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court in case of Abhishek vs. State of Madhya Pradesh reported in 2023INSC779 / (Criminal Appeal No. 1457 of 2015); Preeti Gupta and another vs. State of Jharkhand and another [(2010) 7 SCC 667]; Achin Gupta vs. State of Haryana reported in 2024 INSC 369; Geeta Mehrotra and Anr. vs. State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr. reported in (2012)10 SCC 741; Kahkashan Kauar @ Sonam & Ors. vs. State of Bihar and Ors. reported in 2022 LiveLaw (SC) 141 and Mahalakshmi & Ors. vs. The State of Karnataka & Anr. reported in 2023 INSC 1050, wherein it is observed that ""this Court noted that the tendency to implicate the husband and all his immediate relations is also not uncommon in complaints filed under Section 498A IPC. It was observed that the Courts have to be extremely careful and cautious in dealing with these complaints and must take pragmatic realities into consideration while dealing with matrimonial cases, as allegations of harassment by husband's close relations, who were living in different cities and never visited or rarely visited the place where the complainant resided, would add an entirely different complexion and such allegations would have to be scrutinised with great care and circumspection"".

[5.0] It is necessary to consider whether the power conferred by the High Court under section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is warranted. It is true that the powers under Section 482 of the Code are very wide and the very plenitude of the power requires great caution in its exercise. The Court must be careful to see that its decision in exercise of this power is based on sound principles. The inherent power should not be exercised to stifle a legitimate prosecution. The High Court being the highest court of a State should normally refrain from giving a prima facie decision in a case where the NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/10135/2022 ORDER DATED: 04/08/2025 undefined entire facts are incomplete and hazy, more so when the evidence has not been collected and produced before the Court and the issues involved, whether factual or legal, are of magnitude and cannot be seen in their true perspective without sufficient material. Of course, no hard-and-fast rule can be laid down in regard to cases in which the High Court will exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction of quashing the proceeding at any stage as the Hon'ble Supreme Court has decided in the case of Central Bureau of Investigation vs. Ravi Shankar Srivastava, IAS & Anr., reported in AIR 2006 SC 2872 and in case of State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, reported in 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335, the Apex Court has set out the categories of cases in which the inherent power under Section 482 CrPC can be exercised and held in para 102 as under:

""(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.""
[6.0] In view of above, in the opinion of this Court, the further continuation of criminal proceedings against the petitioner in relation to the impugned FIR would cause unnecessary harassment to the petitioner. Hence, to secure the ends of justice, it would be appropriate NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/10135/2022 ORDER DATED: 04/08/2025 undefined to quash and set aside the impugned FIR and all consequential proceedings initiated in pursuance thereof under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

[7.0] In the result, the petition is allowed. The impugned FIR being CR No.11206075220444 of 2022 registered with Visnagar Town Police Station, District Mehsana as well as all consequential proceedings initiated in pursuance thereof are hereby quashed and set aside qua the present petitioners. Rule is made absolute to the aforesaid extent only. Direct service is permitted.

3. By the impugned order dated 22.11.2024, the application of the applicant preferred under Section 227 of Cr.P.C., seeking discharge, (Application 7B) has been rejected. The order dated 22.11.2024, reads as under :-

""Instant discharge application 7B Under Section 227 Cr.P.C. has been filed by the accused/applicant Md. Shakil for discharge in Case Crime No. 339/2023 under Section 498A, 304B IPC & u/s. 3/4 D.P. Act, stating that the applicant is fully innocent, he has been implicated on the ground of false fact. The marriage of deceased Naseeba Bano was solemnized with applicant against her will without any dowry. She had illicit relation with her cousin Md. Ahmad and she wanted to marry him, she was not happy with her marriage. No demand of dowry of Rs. 5 Lac. was made from the deceased nor she was put in any physical or mental coercion. She was keen of life in liberty and was against the combined family system, so she was making pressure on applicant for separate living. The applicant was in Bombay for his livelihood. On 22.09.2023 he was present in Bombay, in the morning of that day, he received information about the incident and he went to Lucknow from Bombay Via Prayagraj through Indigo Airlines flight, so he has no concern with the incident. He has been falsely implicated in this case only because he is the husband of the deceased. The informant himself has stated in his statement that after some days of marriage his daughter phoned him and stated that her husband looks after her, carefully. The applicant has no motive to commit the offence. The deceased had illicit relation with Md. Ahmad and another boy naming Akib, neighbor in her maternal house. That very Akib reached at applicant house on 22.09.2023 and was making relation with her, which was witnessed by Reshma and Muskan, due to which the deceased was under depression and she committed suicide due to depression. According to Post-mortem Report there was no anti-mortem injury on her body. Unexplained delayed FIR has been lodged. After one month of the incident the informant asked him to handover Rs. 5 Lac., otherwise he will be falsely implicated. The applicant explained his incapability to pay Rs. 5 Lac., then his name was falsely included in the investigation. The inquest of the deceased was done in the present of mother of the applicant. In Parcha 23 of Case Diary, it is mentioned that there was no lover of Muskan and Reshma deceased hanged herself. Prayed for discharge.
According to the Post-Mortem-Report, on the body of deceased there was a ligature mark of 30 cm in length all around the neck and the cause of death is mentioned as Asphyxia due to Anti-Mortem strangulation and such ligature mark, indicates that it is not a case of simple hanging, but it is a case of strangulation and no one can cause such injuries to himself/herself; meaning thereby this is clear-cut case of murder. So, the theory of hanging shown by applicant is not acceptable.
So-far-as the plea of alibi is concerned paper no. 6Kha/1 photocopy of Air-ticket is on record, which reflects that this paper related to Indigo Airlines Flight no. 6E-5191 and 6E-7936 proposed travel con 22.09.2023 (at 11.50 am departure from Bombay and at 02.00 pm arrival on Prayagraj and at 05.00 pm departure from Prayagraj and at 05.45 pm arrival on Lucknow), which was booked on very same date. According to applicant he booked this ticket only after receiving of information, in such situation when his flight arrives at Prayagraj at 02.00 pm and distance of Sultanpur from Prayagraj is less than distance from Lucknow, so, it is beyond understanding that the applicant even after getting such information, he preferred waiting at least 3 hours at Prayagraj Airport to travel to Lucknow instead of taking any other conveyance to reach District Sultanpur, immediately.
Next remarkable point is that travelers name mentioned in this paper is Md. Shakil, but it is not clear that this very Shakil is same person who is accused of this case; plea of alibi is a matter of trial. So, the grounds taken in discharge application are not tenable and this application deserves to be rejected.
Order Discharge application 7B Under Section 227 Cr.P.C. is hereby rejected.
Put up after lunch for framing charge.""
4. Perusal of the above order dated 22.11.2024 and the application preferred by the applicant under Section 227 Cr.P.C., it appears that for seeking discharge the following two grounds/pleas were taken :-

""(i) It is a case of suicide - The deceased committed suicide on account of extra marital affairs with a person known as Akib.
(ii) The plea of alibi - The applicant, at the time of incident was not present at the place of crime as he was present at Mumbai.""
5. In order to come to a conclusion as to whether the trial court has rightly passed the order dated 22.11.2024, this Court took note of the pleadings and documents on record. The facts, which are relevant, are as under :-

(i) The F.I.R. was lodged as Case Crime No.0339/2023, under Sections 498-A, 304-B I.P.C. and Section 3/4 of D.P.Act, at Police Station - Jagdishpur, District - Amethi against Muskan, Resham and lover of Muskan and Resham.
(ii) Muskan and Resham (as mentioned in the F.I.R., though the correct name is ""Reshma"") are the sisters of the applicant.
(iii) The F.I.R. indicates that mother-in-law of the deceased informed the informant (father of the deceased), that the deceased had committed suicide and as per informant the deceased was murdered by the named accused and one unknown person (lover of the named accused).
(iv) The post mortem report indicates cause of death i.e. 'Strangulation' (death on account of 'asphyxia' as a result of 'strangulation').
(v) The name of the applicant surfaced in the subsequent statement of the mother of the deceased recorded by the Investigating Officer.
(vi) The charge sheet was ultimately filed against the applicant and co-accused Muskan and Reshma. It would be in the fitness of things to clarify that co-accused Muskan and Reshma are minor and, accordingly, charge sheet in relation to those co-accused was filed before the Juvenile Justice Board.
(iii) The court cannot act merely as a post office or a mouthpiece of the prosecution but has to consider the broad probabilities of the case, the total effect of the evidence and the documents produced before the court, any basic infirmities, etc. However, at this stage, there cannot be a roving enquiry into the pros and cons of the matter and weigh the evidence as if he was conducting a trial.

(v) At the time of framing of the charges, the probative value of the material on record cannot be gone into but before framing a charge the court must apply its judicial mind on the material placed on record and must be satisfied that the commission of offence by the accused was possible.

(vii) If two views are possible and one of them gives rise to suspicion only, as distinguished from grave suspicion, the trial Judge will be empowered to discharge the accused and at this stage, he is not to see whether the trial will end in conviction or acquittal.' ""

(2) Where the materials placed before the court disclose grave suspicion against the accused which has not been properly explained the court will be fully justified in framing a charge and proceeding with the trial.

(3) The test to determine a prima facie case would naturally depend upon the facts of each case and it is difficult to lay down a rule of universal application. By and large however if two views are equally possible and the Judge is satisfied that the evidence produced before him while giving rise to some suspicion but not grave suspicion against the accused, he will be fully within his right to discharge the accused.

(4) That in exercising his jurisdiction under Section 227 of the Code the Judge which under the present Code is a senior and experienced court cannot act merely as a post office or a mouthpiece of the prosecution, but has to consider the broad probabilities of the case, the total effect of the evidence and the documents produced before the court, any basic infirmities appearing in the case and so on. This however does not mean that the Judge should make a roving enquiry into the pros and cons of the matter and weigh the evidence as if he was conducting a trial.'

8.5. Applying the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decisions and considering the scope of enquiry at the stage of framing of the charge under Sections 227/228 CrPC, we are of the opinion that the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant on merits, at this stage, are not required to be considered. Whatever submissions are made by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant are on merits are required to be dealt with and considered at an appropriate stage during the course of the trial. Some of the submissions may be considered to be the defence of the accused. Some of the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant on the conduct of the victim/prosecutrix are required to be dealt with and considered at an appropriate stage during the trial. The same are not required to be considered at this stage of framing of the charge. On considering the material on record, we are of the opinion that there is more than a prima facie case against the accused for which he is required to be tried. There is sufficient ample material against the accused and therefore the learned trial court has rightly framed the charge against the accused and the same is rightly confirmed by the High Court. No interference of this Court is called for.

9. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present appeal fails and as a result the appeal stands dismissed. Considering the fact that the allegations against the appellant of sexual abuse are very serious and affecting the dignity of a woman and is the most morally and physically reprehensible crime in a society, an assault on the mind and privacy of the victim and the trial for such offences is required to be decided and disposed of at the earliest and considering the fact that in the present case the learned trial court has framed the charge against the accused and the incident is of 2013 and there is already a delay in concluding the trial because of the pending proceedings, we direct the learned trial court to conclude the trial at the earliest within a period of six months from the date of receipt of the order of this Court. All concerned are directed to cooperate with the trial court in the earlier disposal of the trial and within the stipulated time observed hereinabove.""

Xxx 2212. In the warrant trial instituted otherwise than the police report, the complainant gets two opportunities to lead evidence, firstly, before the charge is framed and secondly, after the framing of the charge. Of course, under Section 245(2) CrPC, a Magistrate can discharge the accused at any previous stage of the case, if he finds the charge to be groundless.

Xxx

37. We are convinced that under Section 245(2) CrPC the Magistrate can discharge the accused at any previous stage i.e. even before any evidence is recorded under Section 244(1) CrPC. In that view, the accused could have made the application. It is obvious that the application has been rejected by the Magistrate. So far, there is no difficulty.' (emphasis supplied)

xxx

11. The defence of the accused is not to be looked into at the stage when the accused seeks to be discharged. The expression ""the record of the case"" used in Section 227 Cr. P.C. is to be understood as the documents and articles, if any, produced by the prosecution. The Code does not give any right to the accused to produce any document at the stage of framing of the charge. The submission of the accused is to be confined to the material produced by the investigating agency.

23. On a careful conspectus of the legal spectrum, juxtaposed with our view on the facts and merits expressed hereinbefore, we are satisfied that there is no suspicion, much less strong or grave suspicion that the appellants are guilty of the offence alleged. It would be unjustified to make the appellants face a full-fledged criminal trial in this backdrop. In an appeal dealing with the refusal of the High Court to quash an FIR under Section 482, CrPC albeit, this Court, while setting aside the judgment impugned therein and quashing that FIR, took the view that '...the Appellants are to be protected against vexatious and unwarranted criminal prosecution, and from unnecessarily being put through the rigours of an eventual trial.'15 The protection against vexatious and unwanted prosecution and from being unnecessarily dragged through a trial by melting a criminal proceeding into oblivion, either through quashing a FIR/Complaint or by allowing an appeal against an order rejecting discharge or by any other legally permissible route, as the circumstances may be, in the deserving case, is a duty cast on the High Courts. The High Court should have intervened and discharged the appellants. But this Court will intervene, being the sentinel on the qui vive.""

14. Considering the settled proposition of law by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the judgment(s), referred above, as also paras 4 to 8 of this judgment, which deals with grounds/pleas seeking discharge, this Court is of the view that at this stage of proceedings it can't be said that no offence is made out against the applicant and accordingly, this Court finds no force in the instant application. It is, accordingly, dismissed.

1. List has been revised.

2. Heard Sri Raghuvansh Misra, learned counsel for the applicant and Sri V.P. Srivastava, learned Senior Counsel assisted by Sri Narendra Kumar, learned counsel for the informant as well as Sri Rajendra Prasad Singh, learned State Law Officer and perused the record.

3. Applicant seeks bail in Case Crime No. 20 of 2024, under Sections 498A, 304B I.P.C. and Section 3/4 of D.P. Act, Police Station Mutthiganj, District Prayagraj, during the pendency of trial.

PROSECUTION STORY:

4. The FIR was instituted alleging that the in-laws of the daughter of the informant used to subject her to cruelty after her marriage which was solemnized on 13.02.2023 for a demand of dowry of Rs.20 lacs for business and a house, as such had forced her to commit suicide within the precincts of the house of the applicant at the second floor on 18.03.2024. The applicant and other family members are stated to have set their own house on fire in an attempt to show it to be the cause of accidental death.

ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF APPLICANT :

5. The applicant has been falsely implicated in the present case and he has nothing to do with the said offence.

6. The FIR is delayed as it was instituted in the morning on 19.03.2024 at 7:08 a.m. and the applicant is not named in the FIR.

8. The name of the applicant is absent even in the statement of the informant which was recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C. but subsequently in the supplementary statement of the victim recorded on 06.05.2024 by the Investigating Officer, name of the applicant has come up which is an afterthought and the same has been recorded after a delay of about one and half months.

9. Subsequent to the instant FIR, another FIR was instituted by the applicant whereby two persons of the family of the applicant were put to death by the informant herein and other members of the locality by setting the house on fire.

12. Several other submissions have been made on behalf of the applicant to demonstrate the falsity of the allegations made against him. The circumstances which, as per counsel, led to the false implication of the applicant have also been touched upon at length.

13. There is no criminal history of the applicant. The applicant is languishing in jail since 15.05.2024. The applicant is ready to cooperate with trial. In case, the applicant is released on bail, he will not misuse the liberty of bail.

14. The bail application has been opposed on the ground that it is true that applicant is not named in the FIR but the collusion of the police is but evident from the fact that the FIR mentions the word ""Poora Parivar"" which covers the applicant also as he is the member of the very same family.

15. Learned Senior counsel has further stated that after thorough investigation, the Final Report (charge sheet) has been submitted against the applicant only and other family members have been exonerated.

18. Reiterating the aforesaid view the Supreme Court in the case of Manish Sisodia Vs. Directorate of Enforcement 2024 INSC 595 has again emphasised that the very well-settled principle of law that bail is not to be withheld as a punishment is not to be forgotten. It is high time that the Courts should recognize the principle that ""bail is a rule and jail is an exception"".

21. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, submissions made by learned counsel for the parties, and taking into consideration that the applicant is not named in the FIR and his name has come up in the supplementary statement of the informant subsequently and there being an FIR instituted from the side of the applicant against the informant and other members and without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, the Court is of the view that the applicant has made out a case for bail. The bail application is allowed.

22. Let the applicant-Anshu Kesarwani involved in aforementioned case crime number be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned subject to following conditions.

(i) The applicant shall not tamper with evidence.
(ii) The applicant shall remain present, in person, before the Trial Court on dates fixed for (1) opening of the case, (2) framing of charge and (3) recording of statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. If in the opinion of the Trial Court absence of the applicant is deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall be open for the Trial Court to treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed against him in accordance with law.
23. In case of breach of any of the above conditions, it shall be a ground for cancellation of bail. Identity, status and residence proof of the applicant and sureties be verified by the court concerned before the bonds are accepted.

24. It is made clear that observations made in granting bail to the applicant shall not in any way affect the learned trial Judge in forming his independent opinion based on the testimony of the witnesses.

Swapan Pramanik vs The State Of West Bengal ,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/153258070/,"Calcutta High Court (Appellete Side)
Swapan Pramanik vs The State Of West Bengal & Ors on 2 January, 2025
seeks a mandatory direction upon the respondent nos.3 and 4 to allow the petitioner to resume his duty as a Civic Police Volunteer at Habibpur police station, Malda.

On behalf of the State, it is submitted that the services of the petitioner as a Civic Police Volunteer is not governed by any service rules and only governed by Government Order and as such no disciplinary proceedings is required to be conducted against the petitioner, on prima facie finding the petitioner being involved in a criminal case. The petitioner, therefor, was demobilized. It is true that the petitioner has been acquitted but after eight long years and as such it is not possible to re-engage the petitioner at Habibpur police station on having been acquitted.


After hearing the parties and considering the materials on record, I find that the engagement of the petitioner as a Civic Police Volunteer is in terms of the Government Order and as such the services of the petitioner is not governed by any service rules.

In this background when the employer found that the petitioner has been implicated in a criminal case no steps like initiation of a disciplinary proceedings which could have otherwise been done, had the petitioner been governed by any service rules. The employer, therefor, on finding the petitioner being implicated in a criminal case, lost confidence on the petitioner and had demobilized the petitioner, which according to me, was a correct step. Although, there may not be an employer- employee relationship in case of Civic Police Volunteer since the same is an engagement only for assisting the police force. There can, however, be no doubt that the confidence of the employer on finding that the petitioner being implicated in a criminal case, was shaken. That apart and in any event the criminal case was initiated against the petitioner in the same police station where the petitioner was engaged.

It is well-settled that a criminal case initiated against an employee and the disciplinary proceedings initiated by the employer against the employee are on different footing though the genesis of the incident leading to the same may be common. Even if, the employee is acquitted and/or exonerated from the criminal case, there is no mandate on the employer to re-engage the employee.

Relying on the principal analogous to what is followed in case of employee governed by a service rule. I do not find any substance in the petitioner's submission for a mandatory direction to allow him to resume his duties as a Civic Police Volunteer at Habibpur police station.

The petitioner says that the representation made by the petitioner to allow him to resume his duties should be considered by the respondent no.3. The petitioner relies upon few co-ordinate bench judgments to contend that the representation should be directed to be considered.

After having considered the orders dated 19th January, 2017, 25th October, 2017, 18th February, 2019, 3rd April, 2019, 9th April, 2019, 9th April, 2019 and 24th June, 2019 respectively passed in WP 21555 (W) of 2016, WP 22780 (W) of 2017, WP 3578 (W) of 2019, WP 7032 (W) of 2019, WP 3425 (W) of 2018, WP 4090 (W) of 2018 and WP 10837 (W) of 2019, I do not also find any merit in the petitioner's submission.

Irrespective of the facts, it appears from the aforesaid orders that the representation made by the Civic Police Volunteer on having been demobilized due to involvement in criminal cases had been directed to be considered without going into the merits of the case. The reason for not directing the petitioner's representation to be considered, can be summarized as follows:-

i) The petitioner was implicated in a criminal case in the same police station where the petitioner was engaged. The role of a Civic Police Volunteer is to assist the police authority. The public at large, without going into the authority or status of a Civic Police Volunteer, considers such a volunteer to be part of the police force.
Once the confidence of the public at large within the jurisdiction of Habibpur police station, having been shaken with the petitioner's involvement in a criminal case which becomes known very easily in moffusil or village area, does not go away with the petitioner being acquitted or exonerated. The petitioner is also not required to go to each of the persons within the jurisdiction of Habibpur police station to inform them that he has been acquitted. The public at large also will not know whether the petitioner has been acquitted or exonerated. The public at large carries the impression that he was accused in a criminal case. The confidence of the public at large residing within the jurisdiction of Habirpur police station on finding the petitioner to be re-engaged will be in further jeopardy.

ii) The petitioner is not governed by any service rules and as such there is no check and balance to keep the petitioner to act in a befitting manner while assisting the police force.

iii) A long period of time has elapsed between the petitioner being demobilized on 30th January, 2016 and his date of acquittal on 27th February, 2024, the police authorities cannot, therefor, be mandatorily directed to allow the petitioner to resume his duty. Allowing the representation to be considered may make a stale claim alive which should not be lightly directed.

iv) The petitioner ought to have been cautious while assisting the police force from being involved in a criminal case at the instance of his wife.

For the reasons as aforesaid, the writ petition is dismissed, however, without any order as to cost.

7. Two witnesses of fact have been examined as PW-1 and PW-2 and they have not supported the prosecution story. They have completely resiled from their earlier statements given to the I.O. and the allegations of the FIR.

8. The witnesses have been cross-examined by the public prosecutor after declaring them hostile.

9. There is no possibility of conviction in the present case under the circumstances.

10. The fact of suicide stands falsified from the post mortem report itself whereby the gun shot was found on the right temporal bone of the deceased person and there is blackening present around the wound of entry as such, the applicant has been falsely implicated in the case.

12. There is no criminal history of the applicant. The applicant is languishing in jail since 18.04.2023. The applicant is ready to cooperate with trial. In case, the applicant is released on bail, he will not misuse the liberty of bail.

ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF STATE :

13. The bail application has been opposed but the submissions raised by the learned counsel for the applicant could not be disputed.

CONCLUSION:

14. The well-known principle of ""Presumption of Innocence Unless Proven Guilty,"" gives rise to the concept of bail as a rule and imprisonment as an exception.

15. A person's right to life and liberty, guaranteed by Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, cannot be taken away simply because the person is accused of committing an offence until the guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt. Article 21 of the Indian Constitution states that no one's life or personal liberty may be taken away unless the procedure established by law is followed, and the procedure must be just and reasonable. The said principle has been recapitulated by the Supreme Court in Satender Kumar Antil Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and Ors., 2022 INSC 690.

16. Reiterating the aforesaid view the Supreme Court in the case of Manish Sisodia Vs. Directorate of Enforcement 2024 INSC 595 has again emphasised that the very well-settled principle of law that bail is not to be withheld as a punishment is not to be forgotten. It is high time that the Courts should recognize the principle that ""bail is a rule and jail is an exception"".

17. Learned AGA could not bring forth any exceptional circumstances which would warrant denial of bail to the applicant.

18. It is settled principle of law that the object of bail is to secure the attendance of the accused at the trial. No material particulars or circumstances suggestive of the applicant fleeing from justice or thwarting the course of justice or creating other troubles in the shape of repeating offences or intimidating witnesses and the like have been shown by learned AGA.

19. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, submissions made by learned counsel for the parties, the evidence on record, and without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, the Court is of the view that the applicant has made out a case for bail. The bail application is allowed.

20. Let the applicant-Vikas involved in aforementioned case crime number be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned subject to following conditions.

(i) The applicant shall not tamper with evidence.
(ii) The applicant shall remain present, in person, before the Trial Court on dates fixed for (1) opening of the case, (2) framing of charge and (3) recording of statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. If in the opinion of the Trial Court absence of the applicant is deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall be open for the Trial Court to treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed against him in accordance with law.
21. In case of breach of any of the above conditions, it shall be a ground for cancellation of bail. Identity, status and residence proof of the applicant and sureties be verified by the court concerned before the bonds are accepted.

22. It is made clear that observations made in granting bail to the applicant shall not in any way affect the learned trial Judge in forming his independent opinion based on the testimony of the witnesses.

Ajay Kumar Gupta, J:

1. This instant Criminal Revisional application has been filed by the petitioner under Sections 397/401 read with Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 seeking quashing of the proceeding being Khardah P.S. Case No. 664 of 2017 dated 08.09.2018 vide G.R. No. 6017/17 under Sections 498(A)/406/382/511/506 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 pending before the Learned A.C.J.M at Barrackpore.


2. It is the specific case of the petitioner that the Opposite Party No. 2 initiated false case against the Petitioner. A fake marriage was performed in between the petitioner and the opposite party no. 2 on 08.02.2012 and fulsajjya took place at the residence of the petitioner at Simultala, P.O. & P.S. - Bongaon, District - North 24 Parganas within Bongaon Police Station not within the jurisdiction of Khardah Police Station and/or in Barrackpore jurisdiction. Furthermore, marriage was not consummated.


3. The opposite party no. 2, Sudeshna Malakar residing separately from the petitioner at her parental house due to strained relations. The de-facto complainant/opposite party no. 2 gave birth to a male child on 25.10.2012 under the supervision of the parents of the de-facto complainant/opposite party no. 2 at Charmack Hospital, Teghoria, Kolkata - 700 157.


4. Since marriage, de-facto complainant/opposite party no. 2 has been humiliating the prestige, honour and dignity of the petitioner and threatening the petitioner not to communicate with the de-facto complainant/opposite party no. 2 either physically and/or over telephone.


5. Lastly on 27.01.2017, the de-facto complainant/opposite party no. 2 sent last signal through her letter stating in details therein that there is no chance of the conjugal life in near future and clearly stated that if the petitioner failed to file a case u/s 13B of Hindu Marriage Act at an early date then the de-facto complainant taught lessons by filing criminal cases against the petitioner.

6. Thereafter, the de-facto complainant filed a criminal case against the petitioner on 27.01.2018 before the Learned ACJM at Barrackpore being M.P. Case No. 1410 of 2017 indicating falsely as if the petitioner had committed offence punishable under Sections 498(A)/406/382/511/506 of the IPC.


7. The contention of the petitioner is that the de-facto complainant did not live with the petitioner even for a single day at her matrimonial house since solemnized of such fake marriage. Marriage was not consummated. De-facto complainant has been residing at her parental house all along and now residing at Nandan Apartment, Khardah, North 24-Parganas. The de-facto complainant filed aforesaid case outside the jurisdiction of the Barrackpore Court suppressing all the material facts and only to harass the petitioner as such it is out and out motivated and abuse of process of law. According, the proceeding is liable to be quashed.

8. Khardah P.S. Case No. 664 of 2017 dated 08.09.2018 vide G.R. No. 6017/17 under Sections 498(A)/406/382/511/506 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 initiated against the Petitioner is totally false, fabricated and for the purpose of harassing the petitioner in a calculated manner and defrauding money from the petitioner in such meandering way. Hence this application.


9. On the contrary, the Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Opposite party no.2 vehemently argued by denying all the allegations of the Petitioner and further submitted that in pursuant to advertisement in the news paper, their marriage was solemnized on 08.02.2012 at a rented house ""Kunja Vaban"" Palta and marriage was registered under the Special Marriage Act, 1954 before the Marriage Registrar Officer vide certificate Sl. No. 36/2012 dated 08.02.2012. At the time of marriage, the parents of the Opposite party had gifted cash, gold ornaments, clothing and other valuable other articles to the complainant and same was entrusted to the Petitioner.


10. On the date of Bhoubhat ceremony i.e. on 10.02.2012, the petitioner rebuked her for not presenting the bridal gifts according to their choice and status. Soon after marriage the complainant and petitioner/husband started living as husband and wife at a rented house at Ghushipara, P.S. Titagarh, near 17 No. Rly Gate, where she was residing earlier with her parents since she was working as teacher of Kendriya Vidyalaya posted at Ichapur.

11. It was further submitted that due to said wedlock, a male child, namely, Arunavo Kr. Tikadar was born on 25.10.2012. As the complainant was in service, at the request of the complainant, the parents used to reside with them just to give proper care to the child. With the passage of marital life, the petitioner started physical and mental torture upon the complainant. The petitioner also started creating pressure upon the opposite party no. 2 to open joint account with the bank and to purchase property in the joint name and also started insulting the parents of the complainant/opposite party no. 2. The behaviour of the husband was not good and due to his constant disturbance, the landlord Swarup Dutta asked the opposite party no 2 to vacate the tenanted premises

12. Ultimately, she had to vacate the premises and started living in another rented house from August, 2012 at the house of Sri Binoy Bala. The petitioner never took care of the baby and also never contributed towards the foods, clothes and medicines of the baby child. He had only tendency to squeeze money from the opposite party no. 2. He used to assault the opposite party no. 2.

13. Lastly on 15.12.2015, the petitioner attempted to assault the maid girl of the opposite party no. 2, who tried to intervene the matter. The accused assaulted the complainant and her parents mercilessly. On 19.02.2017, the accused came to the flat of the complainant at Nandan Kanon Ashirbad Apartment which was purchased subsequently by the opposite party no. 2 in the year 2016 and threatened the complainant with criminal intimidation saying that ""Tumi abong tomar chele dujonkei ami prithibi theke chirokaler jonno soriya debo"" meaning thereby ""I will remove both you and your son from the earth forever"".


14. Due to such threatening, the complainant became very scared and lodged a General Diary at Khardah Police Station vide Khardah P.S. GD Entry No. 1633 dated 19.02.2017 and thereafter filed a complaint before the Learned Magistrate under Section 156(3) of the Cr.PC. Subsequently, on the basis of direction of the Learned Magistrate, Khardah Police Station Case No. 664 of 2017 dated 08.09.2018 under Sections 498(A)/406/382/511/506 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 has been registered against the petitioner and subsequently, after completion of investigation, Investigating Officer submitted charge sheet against the petitioner vide Khardah P.S. Charge Sheet No. 917/2019 dated 29.11.2019 under Sections 498A/406/506 of IPC to face the trial. During investigation, the opposite party no. 2 received her stridhan which was seized by the Investigating Officer. Accordingly, the instant Criminal Revisional application is required to be dismissed.


15. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State submitted that the charge sheet has been submitted against the present petitioner and during investigation, stridhan was recovered and handed over to the opposite party no. 2. The statements of witnesses were recorded under Section 161 of the CrPC wherefrom it reveals that the petitioner tortured his wife physically and mentally during staying with the Opposite Party No.2. Therefore, the Criminal Revisional application has no merit and required to be dismissed.

16. Heard the arguments and submissions made by the parties and on perusal of the statements of the witnesses recorded under Section 161 of the CrPC during investigation, it reveals the petitioner was torturing the opposite party no. 2 physically and mentally. It also appears from the statements of the witnesses that the petitioner was involved in the cognizable offence as alleged. During investigation, sufficient materials were collected against the petitioner to establish prima facie case against the petitioner. The contentions of the petitioner regarding innocence and non- consummation of marriage are purely the matter of trial. It is for the complainant to substantiate the allegations by evidence at a later stage in trial.


17. From the perusal of the petition of complaint, it appears that the opposite party no. 2 specifically discloses the commission of cognizable offence committed by the petitioner. She was subjected to physical and mental torture by her husband. Furthermore, it was also alleged that the petitioner never contributed towards foods, medicines and clothing of the child prior to institution of petition of complaint before the Learned Magistrate ,is tentamount to prima facie mental tortured upon the Opposite party since husband has moral and statutory obligations towards his wife and child. She had also lodged a G.D Entry to the police Station being Khardah P.S. GD Entry No. 1633 dated 19.02.2017 prior to initiation of proceedings under Section 156(3) of the CrPC against the Petitioner.

18. Accordingly, there are sufficient prima facie materials against the petitioner available in the case diary. As such, the petitioner herein failed to prove any sufficient or reasonable grounds for allowing his prayer for quashing of the proceedings. Petitioners herein also failed to establish proceeding is frivolous or vexatious or abuse of process of law.


19. We should not forget, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of Maharashtra and Others1 has laid down the several principles to be followed by the Court while exercising its power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. or under Article 226 of the Constitution of India out of those principles, few are as follows: -


""i) The power of quashing should be exercised sparingly with circumspection, as it has been observed, in the 'rarest of rare cases (not to be confused with the formation in the context of death penalty).
(2021) SCC Online SC 315
ii) Criminal proceedings ought not to be scuttled at the initial stage;
iii) Extraordinary and inherent powers of the Court do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the Court to act according to its whims or caprice;
iv) The power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is very wide, but conferment of wide power requires the Court to be more cautious. It casts an onerous and more diligent duty on the Court;
v) While examining an FIR/complaint, quashing of which is sought, the Court cannot embark upon an enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the allegations made in the FIR/complaint;
vi) The first information report is not an encyclopaedia which must disclose all facts and details relating to the offence reported. Therefore, when the investigation by the police is in progress, the court should not go into the merits of the allegations in the FIR. Police must be permitted to complete the investigation. It would be premature to pronounce the conclusion based on hazy facts that the complaint/FIR does not deserve to be investigated or that it amounts to abuse of process of law. After investigation, if the investigating officer finds that there is no substance in the application made by the complainant, the investigating officer may file an appropriate report/summary before the learned Magistrate which may be considered by the learned Magistrate in accordance with the known procedure;
vii) When a prayer for quashing the FIR is made by the alleged accused and the Court when it exercises the power under Section 482 Cr.P.C., only has to consider whether the allegations in the FIR disclose commission of a cognizable offence or not. The Court is not required to consider on merits whether or not the merits of the allegations make out a cognizable offence and the Court has to permit the investigating agency/police to investigate the allegations in the FIR;""
20. In the present case complaint discloses the cognizable offences committed by the Petitioner and furthermore, investigations completed and charge sheet has been submitted against the Petitioner under Sections 498A/406/506 of IPC. The proceeding is at initial stage.


21. In view of the above facts and discussions, this Court finds the instant Criminal Revisional application has devoid of merit and required to be dismissed.


22. Accordingly, CRR 2516 of 2018 is dismissed. Connected applications, if any, are also thus disposed of.

23. Interim order, if any, shall be vacated.


24. Case diary be return to the Ld. Advocate appearing on behalf of the State.


25. Let the copy of the judgment of this Court be sent to the learned Court below for information.


26. Urgent photostat certified copy of this judgment, if applied for, is to be given as expeditiously to the parties on compliance of all formalities.

1. The appellant/husband who was the petitioner before the Trial Court has preferred the present appeal after being unsuccessful before the Trial Court.

2. The petitioner/husband has prayed for divorce from his wife on the ground of cruelty.


3. The matrimonial suit has been filed under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The Ld. Trial Court after consideration of both oral and documentary evidence has dismissed the matrimonial suit on contest without any cost.

4. The factual matrix of the present lis is that the marriage between the parties took place as per Hindu rites and customs on 03.02.2017 and thereafter on 02.03.2017 the marriage was registered. The marriage got consummated between the parties but there has been no child born from the wedlock.

5. The husband in his petition has alleged that the opposite party/wife from the initial stages has been inflicting both mental and physical torture upon him and has been pressurizing him to reside separately in a separate accommodation at her paternal house as 'GharJamai'. The husband has denied to reside in her paternal home as 'GharJamai' as a consequence of which the dispute aggravated. It has also been alleged by the husband that the wife is a suspicious woman and she used to leave the matrimonial house without any information. The wife could not reside at her matrimonial house at a stretch and used to go to her paternal house frequently. It has also been alleged that the wife used to leave her matrimonial house as per her own accord without any information either to the petitioner or his family members. It has further been alleged that the wife left her matrimonial house with all her moveable stridhan articles and gold ornaments on 04.09.2019 and thereafter on 20.01.2020 she had even gone to his place of work and had forcibly entered the quarter of her husband and stayed there without the permission of her husband. It has also been alleged that on 05.04.2021 during the evening the respondent/wife threatened the petitioner and used slang languages and had even threatened to file criminal case against him, as a consequence of which on the same day at about 11.00 p.m. the petitioner had consumed sleeping pills intending to commit suicide, as a result of which he had to be admitted at the Sandeshkhali Gramin Hospital wherefrom he was referred to the Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital wherein also he was admitted and on the next day he was discharged. It has also been alleged that the husband had tried his level best to have a peaceful married life but because of his wife the marriage has not been a successful one.

6. On the contrary the respondent/wife has denied all the allegations raised by her husband. She has categorically denied the allegation of ill-behaviour by her towards her husband and her in-laws. She has also denied the use of abusive languages by her. She has further denied of leaving her matrimonial home without prior approval of her husband or her in-laws, she has also denied the fact of ill-behaviour towards her husband and in-laws and has further denied the fact of not cooking food for her husband and her in-laws and also denied the fact that she would only cook for herself.

7. Mr. Prasanta Kr. Pakrashi Ld. Counsel representing the husband being assisted by Mr. Shyamal Sanyal, Mr. P. Das, Mr. Arup Kr. Chatterjee and Ms. Saswati Manna during his exhaustive argument has stressed upon the point that

i) Since marriage the wife being a woman of short temper used to ill-behave with her husband and her in-laws. She used to leave her matrimonial home without the consent of her husband or her in-laws. She used to cook food for herself only and not for her husband or her in-laws.

ii) The Learned Counsel has also stated that because of unsustainable mental pressure the husband had consumed pills with the intention of committing suicide. The Ld. Counsel has emphasized that the wife through her temperament has created an environment which is not conducive for peaceful cohabitation. As such the husband being a doctor and a gentleman has been compelled to pray for dissolution of the marriage on the ground of cruelty.

iii) The Ld. Counsel has relied upon the following citations:

        a)     AIR 2023 SC 2144

        e)     AIR 2006 SC 1675



8. Per contra, Mr. Srijib Chakraborty Ld. Counsel representing the respondent/wife being assisted by Md. Abdur Rakib and Mr. Biswajit Sarkar during argument has submitted the following:

i) Ld. Counsel has denied all the allegations made on behalf of the petitioner and has further submitted that it is the wife who tried her level best to have a peaceful conjugal life and is even now willing to reside with her husband.
ii) The Ld. Counsel has further submitted that all the allegations made by the petitioner are out of grudge because of the sole reason that from their wedlock no child has born.
iii) He has further submitted that the respondent/wife has been compelled to lodge General Diary being GDE No. 233 dated 04.04.2019 before Noapara Police Station, also filed Noapara P.S. Case No. 136/2019 on 07.05.2019 u/S 498A/406/307 I.P.C. and 3/4 of Dowry Prohibition Act and also lodged another diary being GDE No. 1682/2021 dated 30.06.2021 before Noapara P.S.

c) (2005) SCC Online Cal 293 Banking upon the aforesaid submission the Ld. Counsel has submitted that the impugned judgment requires no interference.

9. Thus, the moot point in issue is as to whether the husband has been able to prove the facet of cruelty.

10. The husband who was the petitioner having been unsuccessful before the Ld. Trial Court has preferred the present appeal and has prayed for divorce solely on the ground of cruelty. In this regard Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act is laid down which is as follows:

""13. Divorce.--(1) Any marriage solemnized, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, may, on a petition presented by either the husband or the wife, be dissolved by a decree of divorce on the ground that the other party-- 1 [(i) has, after the solemnization of the marriage, had voluntary sexual intercourse with any person other than his or her spouse; or (ia) has, after the solemnization of the marriage, treated the petitioner with cruelty; or (ib) has deserted the petitioner for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition; or]
(ii) has ceased to be a Hindu by conversion to another religion;
or [(iii) has been incurably of unsound mind, or has been suffering continuously or intermittently from mental disorder of such a kind and to such an extent that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent. Explanation.--In this clause,--

(a) the expression ""mental disorder"" means mental illness, arrested or incomplete development of mind, psychopathic disorder or any other disorder or disability of mind and includes schizophrenia;


(b) the expression ""psychopathic disorder"" means a persistent disorder or disability of mind (whether or not including sub-- normality of intelligence) which results in abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct on the part of the other party, and whether or not it requires or is susceptible to medical treatment; or]

(v) has been suffering from venereal disease in a communicable form; or

(vi) has renounced the world by entering any religious order; or

(vii) has not been heard of as being alive for a period of seven years or more by those persons who would naturally have heard of it, had that party been alive [Explanation.--In this sub- section, the expression ""desertion"" means the desertion of the petitioner by the other party to the marriage without reasonable cause and without the consent or against the wish of such party, and includes the wilful neglect of the petitioner by the other party to the marriage, and its grammatical variations and cognate expressions shall be construed accordingly.] [(1A) Either party to a marriage, whether solemnized before or after the commencement of this Act, may also present a petition for the dissolution of the marriage by a decree of divorce on the ground-- (i) that there has been no resumption of cohabitation as between the parties to the marriage for a period of 8 [one year] or upwards after the passing of a decree for judicial separation in a proceeding to which they were parties; or (ii) that there has been no restitution of conjugal rights as between the parties to the marriage for a period of 8 [one year] or upwards after the passing of a decree for restitution of conjugal rights in a proceeding to which they were parties.] (2) A wife may also present a petition for the dissolution of her marriage by a decree of divorce on the ground,--

(i) in the case of any marriage solemnized before the commencement of this Act, that the husband had married again before such commencement or that any other wife of the husband married before such commencement was alive at the time of the solemnization of the marriage of the petitioner:

Provided that in either case the other wife is alive at the time of the presentation of the petition; or
(ii) that the husband has, since the solemnization of the marriage, been guilty of rape, sodomy or 1 [bestiality; or] [(iii) that in a suit under section 18 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 (78 of 1956), or in a proceeding under section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) (or under the corresponding section 488 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (5 of 1898), a decree or order, as the case may be, has been passed against the husband awarding maintenance to the wife notwithstanding that she was living apart and that since the passing of such decree or order, cohabitation between the parties has not been resumed for one year or upwards; (iv) that her marriage (whether consummated or not) was solemnized before she attained the age of fifteen years and she has repudiated the marriage after attaining that age but before attaining the age of eighteen years.
Explanation.--This clause applies whether the marriage was solemnized before or after the commencement of the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 (68 of 1976).]""

On plain reading of Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act it transpires that any marriage solemnized can be dissolved by a decree of divorce on the ground that either party after the solemnization of the marriage treated the petitioner with cruelty. So cruelty being the sole criteria for the divorce which has been raised by the husband in this lis, this Court delves into the evidence of the parties. The husband has emphasized time and again on the issue of mental pressure being imposed upon him and his parents by the wife. The husband has stated that his wife does not show any respect either towards him or towards his parents and she is adamant and leaves the matrimonial house as per her wish and she even does not look after his parents. From the evidence it transpires that the husband himself has not taken any step against his wife rather his father has been proactive to take initiative against his daughter-in-law by filing cases against her.
The wife has denied all the allegations of ill-temper and disobedience by her, on the other hand she has expressed her desire to reside with her husband and to lead peaceful conjugal life.
The husband in his petition before the Trial Court praying for divorce, has mentioned that his wife creates pressure upon him to reside in a separate accommodation at her parental house as ""Ghar jamai"", which being refused by the husband his wife has started to threaten him by saying that she would commit suicide. On the other hand during the time of adducing evidence the husband has deposed that his wife pressurizes him for separate accommodation near the parental house of his wife which is in contrary to the parental house as stated in the petition. These two statements do not corroborate each other.
Allegation of uttering verbal abuse against each other have been raised by both the parties.
11. On behalf of the husband an incident of 05.04.2021 has been highlighted to bring home the allegation of cruelty against the wife. It has been stated that cruelty inflicted by the wife's behaviour was so immense and unbearable that the petitioner had lost his capacity of rational thinking and consumed some pills. As a result he was required to be hospitalized. The incident has obviously been highlighted to show that cruelty meted out to the petitioner was of such magnitude that it was impossible to reside with the wife. In support of such submission the draft discharge info. dated 06.04.2021 of the husband has been marked as exhibit-2. On a holistic consideration of the oral and documentary evidence it appears that when the petitioner claims to have consumed the pills he was residing alone at his official accommodation. None has come forward to corroborate the fact regarding consumption of pills. The only document relied upon is the draft discharge info. There is nothing to show that he was referred by the hospital at Sandeshkhali where he was posted, to the Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital, which has issued the draft discharge info. From the draft discharge info. it further appears that the petitioner was admitted at this hospital at 01.19 a.m. on 06.04.2021 and was discharged the very same day at 04.51 p.m. While admitted he was administered intravenous fluid and one injection. The draft discharge info., therefore, does not manifest any severe or critical situation as it is apparent that the petitioner being a doctor has left the hospital on the very same day against medical advice. The draft discharge info., however shows that the petitioner has been diagnosed to have come with Benzo Diazepines overdose. In his evidence, however, he has claimed that he had taken more than 50 pills of Clonazepam and Diazepam. In his deposition, he has further claimed that the overdose was lethal for human life and could have caused respiratory depression. The draft discharge info., however, does not corroborate such severity as claimed in the oral deposition. From the draft discharge info. it does appear that there has been overdose but only of Benzo Diazepines and not of the two medicines as claimed by the petitioner in his oral deposition. The overdose also does not appear to be lethal as the assertion of the overdose is not corroborated by any specific quantity either divulged by the petitioner in his evidence or by the draft discharge info. as the treatment manifest from the draft discharge info. does not indicate any aggressive/ lifesaving treatment. This evidence, therefore, be viewed keeping in background the fact that the petitioner himself is a doctor. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the incident of 05.04.2021 as claimed by the petitioner does not lay the basis to infer that he has been subjected to cruelty as claimed by the petitioner. Another aspect casting shadow of doubt on this incident, to establish cruelty is the fact that the father of the petitioner has lodged a criminal case before the Noapara police station more than 2 months later i.e. on 10.06.2021. The evidence, therefore, does not support the cruelty as claimed by the petitioner on 05.04.2021.

Another aspect of the matter destroying credibility of this entire incident is the fact that apart from himself the husband has examined one witness PW2, who happens to be the owner of a pathological clinic. In his deposition he has clearly stated that he has no knowledge about the personal life of other doctors, but surprisingly he knows about the personal life of the petitioner. He claims to have heard the respondent/ wife uttering harsh words towards her husband and pressurising him, but this evidence is not with reference to any particular incident. The evidence, therefore, is not direct and not as an eye witness to any incident. The petitioner appears to have a commercial relationship with the PW2, who was constantly benefiting from the references being made to his pathological clinic by the petitioner. In this circumstance the evidence given by him without reference to any details or a specific incident, therefore, in our opinion lacks credibility and his evidence cannot be relied upon.

Insofar as the deposition of the father-in-law PW3 in support of the petitioner, we find that he was not having cordial relation with the respondent (daughter-in-law). In fact, from perusal of exhibit-A/1, letter dated 08.06.2021 written by the father of the husband addressing the father of the wife, adduced by the wife it becomes obvious that he was hostile towards his daughter-in- law because she could not bear a child. In the exhibit A/1 he has stated the follwoing:

""Je goru dudh dai, tar lathi sojjho kora jay. Kintu je goru dudh o dai na, bachha o deoar kono somvabona nei, kebol singh nare o dhun mare, lathi chore, take ami pushte parbo na""
Translated version : ""One can tolerate a cow which gives milk but a cow which neither gives milk nor is capable of giving birth to an offspring and which only gores cannot be nurtured.""

From this document it is apparent that the father-in-law was opinionated and hostile to the wife/ respondent. It is only expected that he would make statements to support the petitioner's claim for divorce. This aspect is also apparent from the fact that he has been filing cases including the criminal case bearing Noapara P.S. case No. 176 of 2021 under Section 448/506 I.P.C. on 10.06.2021, i.e. more than 2 months after the consumption of pills on 05.04.2021.

It may be relevant to take into consideration here the deposition of the petitioner during cross-examination on 12.04.2022, on that day 9 copies of medical investigation report pertaining to the wife (respondent) were tendered as Exhibit-B Series. The deposition of the husband upon seeing the medical investigation is relevant and we consider it apposite to reproduce the same:


""From the report dated 31.12.2020 of Sparsha Diagnostics it appears that the level of Anti Mullerian Hormone of my wife was sufficiently satisfactory. If the level of Anti Mullerian Hormone is at normal level then a lady does not face any problem in conceiving. Witness volunteers: In case of my wife Anti Mullerian Hormone is not normal.""
It is thus apparent that the father-in-law has deposed in support of the divorce on extraneous consideration.

12. The wife has filed criminal case under Section 498A /406/307 I.P.C. dated 07.05.2019 on the ground of cruelty and domestic violence.

13. Insofar as the issue of cruelty is concerned, we find that no convincing material has been brought before the Trial Court in support of the allegations made in the pleadings. Under similar circumstances this Court in the case of Sri Ananth Bandhu Adak vs. Smt. Anita Adak (Patra) (F.A. 140 of 2022) recently decided on 19.12.2024 has held that it is trite law that cruelty is required to be established both by pleading and proof so as to constitute a ground for dissolution of marriage/ divorce. In the present case as noted above there is not an iota of material to substantiate the same. It has been repeatedly held by the Courts that cruelty has many facets and may differ from person to person depending on the social context, economic strata of the parties to the marriage and such other factors. Be that as it may whatever may be the bench mark for assessing cruelty there must be some incident of cruelty proved by the party alleging it, which in the present case is lacking.

The law also in this regard is well-settled by several decisions of the Apex Court. We intend to refer and rely upon a celebrated decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Samar Ghosh vs. Jaya Ghosh reported in (2007) 4 SCC 511. The Apex Court considering the various earlier judgments on the issue of cruelty as a ground for dissolution of marriage, has held that there can be no fixed comprehensive definition of mental cruelty. What is cruelty in one case may not amount to cruelty in another case and the subject of cruelty differ from person to person depending upon the upbringing level of sensitivity, educational qualification, family and cultural background, the financial position, social status, customs, traditions etc. Having observed so the Apex Court has laid down the law that it would be prudent and appropriate to adjudicate a case by evaluating the peculiar facts and circumstances keeping in background the above noted considerations by way of illustration. Some instances of human behaviour which may be relevant in dealing with the case of mental cruelty have also been enumerated therein in Paragraph100 of the judgment in the case of Samar Ghosh (supra). We find that in the present case the plaintiff has failed to substantiate that the allegations levelled against the respondent, falls within any of the illustrations contained in the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Samar Ghosh (supra). True it is that the illustration is not exhaustive and it is not required that the case must fall within only one of those circumstances as enumerated in the judgment of the Apex Court, but in the present case the allegation of cruelty is devoid of any substance whatsoever. Apart from an allegation of cruelty, there is no convincing proof of cruelty corroborated by any material whatsoever.

14. Considering the evidence on record it is clear that the husband has tried his level best to prove the allegation which has been brought by him that is cruelty, but the same does not inspire any confidence.

15. The judgment referred on behalf of the petitioner, published in AIR 2023 SC 2144 does not help the cause of the petitioner/husband. In the said case there has been long separation, absence of co-habitation and complete breakdown of all meaningful bonds and existence of bitterness between the two parties. Relying on the aforementioned facts and circumstances the Hon'ble Apex Court exercising jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India has severed the tie. In this instant case the wife has deposed that she is inclined to live together with her husband because she believes in conjugal relationship and thinks that the days of sufferings will end. So the circumstance of the case is not similar to the one which is being dealt with.

The judgment referred to being published in 2024 (1) ICC 288 (S.C.) also does not support the case of the appellant. In the said case referred there has been twelve years of separation and continued bitterness and dead emotions which have been construed as a case of irretrievable breakdown of marriage. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the said case has granted decree of divorce under Article 142 of the Constitution of India as there being irretrievable breakdown of marriage.

The other judgment cited on behalf of the petitioner/husband being AIR 2023 SC 4920 also does not come in aid to the petitioner/husband. On the contrary the referred judgment supports the case of the respondent herein. In the referred judgment the Hon'ble Judges of the Apex Court have been inclined not to pass an order of divorce under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. Respecting the sentiments of the wife the Hon'ble Apex Court has been of the view that passing an order of divorce under Article 142 would not be doing complete justice to the parties and would rather be doing injustice to the respondent/wife.

Another judgment been referred to published in AIR 2023 MP 38 also does not come in aid to the petitioner/husband as the issue dealt in the said judgment is as regards to permanent alimony which is not the issue being dealt in this present case.

The judgment passed by the Hon'ble Three Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case between Naveen Kohli and Neelu Kohli reported in AIR 2006 SC 1675 has been relied upon by the petitioner/husband. While passing the said judgment the Hon'ble Apex Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India has considered the facts and circumstances of the said case to be a fit case of irretrievable breakdown of marriage. As irretrievable breakdown of marriage is not as yet a statutory ground for divorce and having regard to the appellant being exercised by this Court the judgment is of no help to the petitioner/husband.

In the judgment referred on behalf of the respondent being published in (2015) 11 SCC 539 the Hon'ble Apex court has stated that the expression cruelty has not been defined in the Hindu Marriage Act. Cruelty for the purpose of Section 13(1)(i- A) is to be taken as a behavior by one spouse towards the other which causes a reasonable apprehension in the mind of the latter that it is not safe for him or her to continue the matrimonial relationship with the other. Cruelty can be physical or mental. In case of mental cruelty matter of inference is to be drawn from the facts and circumstances of the case. It is settled law that instances of cruelty are not to be taken in isolation but to take the cumulative effect of the facts and circumstances emerging from the evidence on record and then draw a fair inference whether the plaintiff has been subjected to mental cruelty due to conduct of the other spouse.

The judgment published in (2010) 14 SCC 301 and the judgment published in (2017) 11 SCC 539 are on similar lines. These judgments are also applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case wherein the petitioner appellant has failed to prove any facts and circumstances based on any convincing material from a cumulative effect of which the Court may draw a fair inference of the petitioner being subjected to cruelty.

16. Thus, we are of the considered opinion that the Ld. Trial Court has dealt with the issues in the correct perspective and the impugned judgment does not require any interference.

17. Thus the instant appeal being F.A.T. 211 of 2022 is dismissed without any cost.


18. IA No. CAN 2 of 2023 In view of the final order being passed in the present appeal the application praying for alimony pendente lite under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 stands disposed of. The respondent /wife shall be at liberty to take recourse of law in appropriate proceedings as regards to arrears which have been mentioned in the supplementary affidavit to the said application. In this context it is worth mentioning that as the application was filed at the stage of final hearing of the appeal. Vide two orders passed earlier in these proceedings dated 05.09.2024 and 05.10.2024, Rs. 1,25,000/- (Rupees one lakh twenty five thousand) [one lakh and thereafter twenty five thousand] was directed to be paid to the wife on ad-hoc basis, which was paid by the Appellant.

19. Parties shall be entitled to act on the basis of the server copy of the judgment and order placed on the official website of the Court.

20. Urgent certified photo copies of this judgment, if applied for, be given to the parties upon compliance of the requisite formalities.

Vikram Singh vs State Of Rajasthan (2025:Rj-Jd:297) on 3 January, 2025
Order 03/01/2025

1. The instant criminal misc. petition has been filed under Section 482 Cr.PC/528 BNSS on behalf of the petitioner for quashing of the entire proceeding pending against him in the Court of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Pali (hereinafter to be referred as 'the trial court') in regular case No.1546/2022, arising out of FIR No.128/2022 registered at Police Station Rohat, District Pali for the offences under Sections 498A, 323 and 341 of the IPC, on the ground of compromise.

2. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the dispute in this matter is inter se between the parties which does not affect the societal interest or anyway disturb the tranquility or public peace. It is further submitted that both the parties [2025:RJ-JD:297] (2 of 4) [CRLMP-8681/2024] have settled their disputes through amicable settlement, for which a compromise-deed has been executed and submitted before the learned trial court.

3. It is also submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner that the charge-sheet has been filed against the petitioner for the offences under Sections 498A, 323 and 341 of the IPC, however, the learned trial court has attested the compromise for the offences under Sections 323 and 341 of the IPC of IPC but refused to attest the compromise for the offences under Section 498-A of IPC as the same is not compoundable and kept the proceeding pending by it. It is submitted that as the parties have entered into compromise, there remains no controversy in between them and the parties do not wish to continue the criminal proceedings further.

4. Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the judgment passed by Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the case of Gian Singh Vs. State of Punjab reported in (2012) 10 SCC 303.

5. On the other hand, learned counsel appearing for complainant-respondent No.2 admits the fact of compromise and submits that the complainant-respondent No.2 is willing if the FIR and the proceedings are quashed on the basis of compromise entered in between the parties.

6. Learned Public Prosecutor has opposed the petition.

7. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the material available on record more particularly nature of allegation and the compromise deed executed in between [2025:RJ-JD:297] (3 of 4) [CRLMP-8681/2024] the parties. The parties to the lis have resolved their dispute amicably and do not wish to continue the criminal proceedings and have jointly prayed for quashing of the same.

8. Some of the offences alleged in this matter are non-compoundable, however, Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Gian Singh (supra) has propounded that if it is convinced that offences are entirely personal in nature and do not affect the public peace or tranquility and where it feels that quashing of such proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace and would secure ends of justice, the High Court should not hesitate to quash the same by exercising the inherent powers vested in it. It is observed that in such cases, the prosecution becomes a lame prosecution and pursuing such a lame prosecution would be a waste of time and energy that will also unsettle the compromise and obstruct restoration of peace. This court is aptly guided by the principles propounded by Hon'ble the Supreme Court and feels that where the dispute is essentially inter se between the parties, either they are relatives, neighbours or having business relationship and which does not affect the society at large, then in such cases, with a view to maintain harmonious relationships between the two sides, to end-up the dispute in between them permanently as well as for restitution of relationship, the High Court should exercise its inherent power to quash [2025:RJ-JD:297] (4 of 4) [CRLMP-8681/2024] the FIR and all other subsequent proceedings initiated thereto.

9. Here in this case, though some of the offences are not compoundable but the parties have settled the dispute amicably, the complainant-respondent No.2 do not wish to continue the proceedings against the petitioner and, that is essentially in between the parties, which is not affecting public peace and tranquility, therefore, with a view to maintain the harmony and to resolve the dispute finally in between the parties, it is deemed appropriate to quash the FIR and the entire proceedings undertaken in pursuance thereof.

10. Accordingly the instant criminal misc. petition is allowed. The entire proceeding pending in the Court of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Pali in regular case No.1546/2022 arising out of FIR No.128/2022 registered at Police Station Rohat, District Pali are hereby quashed and set aside.

11. The accused petitioner is acquitted from the charges and if he is on bail, his bail bonds are discharged.

12. The stay petition is disposed of.

Boddu Rani vs The State Of Andhra Pradesh,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/82733666/,"Andhra Pradesh High Court - Amravati
Boddu Rani vs The State Of Andhra Pradesh on 3 January, 2025
The instant petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short, ""Cr.P.C."") has been filed by the Petitioners/Accused Nos.2 to 4 seeking quashment of the proceedings against them in C.C.No.751 of 2022 on the file of III Additional Junior Civil Judge, Dr.VJPJ, Tirupati for the offences punishable under Section 498-A r/w 34 of IPC and Sections 3 & 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act.


2. Heard Sri Srinivasulu Kurra, learned counsel for the petitioners, Ms. K.Salini, learned counsel representing Sri O.Udaya Kumar, learned counsel for the respondent No.2 and Ms. K.Priyanka Lakshmi, learned Assistant Public Prosecutor on behalf of the State.


3. Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the petitioners herein are A2 to A4 who are the mother, brother of A1 and A4 is wife of A3. A1 is the husband of the respondent No.2. Learned counsel would further submit that the marriage of A1 and the respondent No.2 took place on 01.08.2012. The petitioners never stayed with A1 and the respondent No.2 under the same roof at any point of time. Learned counsel would submit that except making omnibus allegations, nothing is attributed against the petitioners in specific. Learned counsel would further submit that the respondent No.2 started a living separate from the husband since 23.12.2021 and this case is lodged on 11.05.2022 only to trouble the family members of the husband. DVC case is also filed. Learned counsel would further submit that only as an arm-twist, this case has been lodged against the family members. Even as per the contents of the complaint, the petitioners never stayed with A1 and the respondent No.2 except a few visits. Learned counsel would further submit that there are no ingredients to attract the offence under Section 498A and Sections 3 & 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act against the Dr.VJPJ, petitioners and continuing criminal proceedings against them is mere abuse of process of law.

Learned counsel would further submit that it is not a fit case for quashment. After due investigation, the Police have filed charge sheet.

5. Learned Assistant Public Prosecutor supported the version of the respondent No.2.

Determination by the Court

6. A bare perusal of Section 482 makes it clear that the Code envisages that inherent powers of the High Court are not limited or affected so as to make orders as may be necessary; (i) to give effect to any order under the Code or, (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or, otherwise (iii) to secure ends of justice. A court while sitting in Section 482 jurisdiction is not functioning as a court of appeal or a court of revision. It must exercise its powers to do real and substantial justice, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case. These Dr.VJPJ, powers must be invoked for compelling reasons of abuse of process of law or glaring injustice, which are against sound principles of criminal jurisprudence.

7. To decide further in this matter, it is relevant to extract Section 498-A of I.P.C.

Section 498A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty.--Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.

Explanation.--For the purposes of this section, ""cruelty"" means--

(a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or
(b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.]
8. The essential ingredients under section 498A are as follows;

 A woman must be married;

 Such women must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment and;  Such cruelty or harassment must have been shown either by the husband or the relative of husband.

9. For the purpose of constituting an offense under the Section referred Supra, the ingredients thereon must be existing. The Section also defines the meaning of cruelty. Thus, Section 498A is a powerful weapon in the hands of married women against subjection to cruelty and harassment by her husband or his relatives.


Dr.VJPJ,

10. The context of quashment of criminal proceedings initiated in matrimonial matters, the Hon'ble Supreme Court and this Court delivered numerous decisions. It is relevant to refer to a few, at this juncture.

11. In the context of quashment of criminal proceedings arising out of matrimonial matters, the Hon'ble Apex Court in Kahkashan Kausar @ Sonam v. State of Bihar1, held as follows:

""18. The above-mentioned decisions clearly demonstrate that this court has at numerous instances expressed concern over the misuse of section 498A IPC and the increased tendency of implicating relatives of the husband in matrimonial disputes, without analysing the long term ramifications of a trial on the complainant as well as the accused. It is further manifest from the said judgments that false implication by way of general omnibus allegations made in the course of matrimonial dispute, if left unchecked would result in misuse of the process of law. Therefore, this court by way of its judgments has warned the courts from proceeding against the relatives and in-laws of the husband when no prima facie case is made out against them.
*****
22.Therefore, upon consideration of the relevant circumstances and in the absence of any specific role attributed to the accused appellants, it would be unjust if the Appellants are forced to go through the tribulations of a trial, i.e., general and omnibus allegations cannot manifest in a situation where the relatives of the complainant's husband are forced to undergo trial. It has been highlighted by this court in varied instance that a criminal trial leading to an eventual acquittal also inflicts severe scars 2022 LiveLaw (SC) 141 Dr.VJPJ, upon the accused, and such an exercise must therefore be discouraged.""
(emphasis supplied)

12. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Achin Gupta v. State of Haryana and another2, highlighted the requirement of taking the realities into consideration and legislating, especially in the context of the Sections 85 and 86 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023. The relevant observations made in the context of the present case highlighting the duty of this Court, in the said judgment is as follows;


""25. If a person is made to face a criminal trial on some general and sweeping allegations without bringing on record any specific instances of criminal conduct, it is nothing but abuse of the process of the court. The court owes a duty to subject the allegations levelled in the complaint to a thorough scrutiny to find out, prima facie, whether there is any grain of truth in the allegations or whether they are made only with the sole object of involving certain individuals in a criminal charge, more particularly when a prosecution arises from a matrimonial dispute.""
(emphasis supplied)

13. In Payal Sharma v. State of Punjaband Another3, the Hon'ble Supreme Courtheld as follows::


2024 INSC 369 2024 INSC 896 Dr.VJPJ, ""The decisions referred above on the subject of exercise of power under Section 482, Cr.P.C., would undoubtedly cast a duty on the Courts to consider the contentions that there is lack of specific allegations against the accused concerned to constitute the offence(s) alleged against a relative or that the implication was nothing but an over implication to pressurise the family of the husband to yield to the demands. The Courts cannot refrain from discharging the obligation to consider such contentions.""
(emphasis supplied)
14. In the backdrop of the legal position discussed supra, it can be clearly stated that in criminal proceedings arising out of matrimonial matters, when there is no iota or whisper of allegations present In the contents of the complaint, necessary for the ingredients under the Section, general, vague and omnibus allegations and mere casual reference of names of relatives of the husband cannot be taken into account to sustain the accusations. Coming to the facts of the present case, a fair look at the contents of the complaint and the charge sheet, except making casual reference of names of A3 and A4 that after giving birth to the female child, when they visited their house, they used to join A1 to harass the wife, nothing is attributed in specific against them. But coming to the case of A2, there are specific allegations.In that view, it is tenable to quash the crime against A3 and A4 and not against A2.

15. In the result, the petition is partly allowed. The proceedings against the petitioners/Accused Nos. 3 & 4 in C.C.No.751 of 2022 on the file of III Dr.VJPJ, Additional Junior Civil Judge, Tirupati for the offences punishable under Section 498-A r/w 34 of IPC and Sections 3 & 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act is hereby quashed. However, the Petition filed by the Accused No.2 is dismissed.


As a sequel thereto, miscellaneous petitions pending, if any, shall stand closed.

3. Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that the applicant is an innocent person and has been falsely implicated in the present case and he is in jail since 13.10.2024. He further submitted that the applicant was enjoying his matrimonial life, but his father-in-law, namely, Shri Lallanji Ojha was not happy with the cordial relation of applicant and his wife, as a result, he lodged one FIR bearing No.61 of 2020 under Sections 498A, 504, 506, 509 IPC and Section 67 (A) of IT Act, PS- Gomti Nagar Extension, District- Lucknow on 15.06.2020. After submission of final report, his daughter (wife of applicant) categorically denied the contents of the aforesaid FIR, as a result, final report no.2 dated 06.05.2022 was prepared by the Investigating Officer and submitted to the court concerned. He vehemently submitted that on the basis of incorrect facts, FIR of case in question was lodged. As per the prosecution case, the fire was opened by the applicant on the informant of the present case, as a result, he received injuries. Then he was brought to the hospital on bike by one Pranav Mishra. During the course of investigation, statement of informant/injured was recorded. In his statement, he categorically stated that Pranav Mishra brought him to the hospital. At the same time, statement of Pranav Mishra was also recorded by the Investigating Officer, in which, he categorically denied the contents of statement of informant and stated that he did not bring the informant to the hospital. He further submitted that as per the medico-legal report, informant/injured was brought to the hospital by one Rupesh Dixit who also denied the version of the informant/injured. He next submitted that on the behest of informant, applicant was being victimized by the jail authorities and when he reported the same to the authorities, then he was medically examined, in which, certain injuries were also found on the body of the applicant when he was inside the jail.

4. Learned counsel for the applicant further submitted that applicant was first taken into custody on 26.06.2020 and he was released on interim bail on 07.05.2021 vide order dated 05.05.2021 passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court, thereafter, he surrendered before the Chief Judicial Magistrate concerned and at the same time, he again requested before the Hon'ble Supreme Court for extension of bail, but the same was rejected with the liberty to the applicant to file fresh bail application before the High Court. As a result, he has filed the present bail application. He further submitted that the applicant is in jail since 13.10.2024, charge sheet has been filed and name of 26 witnesses are shown in the charge sheet but till today, charge has not been framed and in near future, there is no possibility of conclusion of trial. In these circumstances, the applicant is entitled for bail. In case of being enlarged on bail, he will not misuse the liberty of bail.

5. Learned counsel for the applicant also informed that today, the case was listed before the trial court for framing of charge, but charge could not be framed, as a result, the case has been adjourned and the same has been fixed on 10.01.2025.

6. Learned A.G.A. as well as learned counsel for the informant opposed the prayer of the applicant for grant of bail and submitted that applicant was a fugitive and he avoided the proceedings of trial court from the date of lodging of FIR upto date of his arrest and he has also misused the liberty given by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. They also submitted that the statement of informant/injured corroborates with the medico-legal report, therefore, applicant is not entitled for bail.

7. Considering the rival submissions of learned counsel for parties, material available on record, contents of the F.I.R., order dated 14.11.2024 passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Misc. Application No.2247 of 2024 arising out of SLP (Crl.) No.2005 of 2021 as well as other relevant documents, it is evident that the liberty was given to the applicant to approach the High Court by moving the bail application and the request was made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court to the High Court to make an endeavour to decide the bail application of the applicant expeditiously, preferably within a period of four weeks. Thereafter, present bail application was filed. As per the prosecution case, the informant/injured was brought to the hospital by Pranav Mishra and admission in hospital was given with the assistance of Rupesh Dixit, but in the statement of Pranav Mishra and Rupesh Dixit, both of them have denied the aforesaid facts. As the applicant is in jail since 13.10.2024 but till today, charge has not been framed. In such circumstances, I am of the view that the applicant is entitled to be released on bail.

8. Let applicant - Anshuman Pandey - be released on bail in aforesaid Case Crime, on his furnishing personal bond of Rs.5,00,000/- (Five Lakh Rupees Only) and two reliable sureties ofRs.5,00,000/- (Five Lakh Rupees Only) each subject to following conditions:-

13. The findings on the above points are as under:

Point No.1 & 2 : In the Negative Point No.3 : As per final order REASONS
14. Point No.1 & 2: These points are taken up together for the purpose of common discussion in order to avoid repetition of facts as they form the same part of transaction. In support of prosecution case as narrated in paragraph 2 and the point for consideration in paragraph 12 of this judgment, the prosecution examined seven witnesses, which are as follows:

i. CW1 by name Smt. Kavitha, being Informant examined as PW1 deposed about the ill-treatment given by the accused persons for demanding additional dowry and subjected her to both mental and physical cruelty. Hence, she lodged complaint before police as per Ex.P1 and police conducted spot manahar as per Ex.P2. She has given documents as per Ex.P3 to 8 i.e., marriage invitation, photographs, Marriage certificate, death certificate of her first husband and rent agreement and she also identified her signatures as Ex.P1(a) and 2(a).
ii. CW9 by name Sri Vinod Rathod, the then PSI of Yeshwanthpura PS examined as PW2 deposed that he on completion of investigation, submitted charge sheet against accused persons.
KABC030523422020 CC No.13999/2020 iii. CW6 by name Sri Sunil, panch witness examined as PW3 who identified his signature on Ex.P2 spot mahazar as per Ex.P2(a) which was drawn at Nanjappa Reddy Colony in the presence of CW7 and him. He does not know the contents of the Ex.P2 -spot mahazar.
iv. CW8 by name Sri Prashanth Khan Gowda Patil, the then PSI of Yeshwanthpura PS examined as PW4 deposed that on 16-03-2016 he received the first information from PW1 as per Ex.P1. On the basis of which, he registered FIR as per Ex.P9 and thereafter he visited the spot on 17-03-2020 and conducted Ex.P2 spot mahazar in the presence of CW6 and CW7 and he recorded the statements of witnesses and recorded further statement of PW1 and obtained the marriage invitation, photographs marriage registration certificate, rental agreement from PW1 as per Ex.P3 to 8 and handed over the case papers to CW9.
v. CW4 Smt. Manjula Devi and CW5 Smt.Fatima were examined as PW5 and PW6 respectively and deposed that they pleaded ignorance about the prosecution case. In this regard, the learned Sr.APP has cross examined these witnesses by treating them as hostile witnesses but no favorable answers have been elicited from them to support the prosecution case. Their denial of statements given before the police is marked as Ex.P3 and P4.
vi. CW2 by name M.P.Lalitha, the mother of PW1 examined as PW7 deposed that CW1 is her daughter and her marriage was solemnized with accused No.1 on 16- KABC030523422020 CC No.13999/2020 04-2017. CW1's first husband Satish had died and she has a son from her first marriage. The accused had taken a total of 57 grams of gold ornaments from CW1 thereafter they ill-treated CW1 for dowry.
15. Evidence of Prosecution must be established that the accused No.1 to accused No.3 started torturing PW1 for bringing additional dowry. Mere omnibus statement regarding harassment does not ipso facto makes out a case under section 498A IPC, prosecution is required to prove the overt acts attributed by the accused beyond reasonable doubt and the said principle is appreciated in case of Sakharam and another vs State of Maharastra reported in (2003) 12 SCC 368. Basing this decision, the present cases are taken up for discussion.

16. It is relevant to reiterate Section 498A of Indian Penal Code which reads as under

Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty --
Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.
KABC030523422020 CC No.13999/2020 Explanation.-- For the purposes of this section, ""cruelty"" means--
(a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or
(b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.
For commission of an offence under Section 498- A of IPC, the following necessary ingredients require to be satisfied:

(a) The woman must be married;
(b) She must be subjected to cruelty or harassment; and
(c) Such cruelty or harassment must have been shown either by husband of the woman or by the relative of her husband and the said principle is appreciated in the case of U. Suvetha v. State reported in (2009) 6 SCC 757.
17. Every harassment does not amount to ""cruelty"" within the meaning of Section 498-A. For the purpose of Section 498-A, harassment simpliciter is not ""cruelty"" and it is only when harassment is committed for the purpose of coercing a woman or any other person related to her to meet an unlawful demand for property, etc. that it amounts to ""cruelty"" punishable under Section 498-A IPC and the said principle is appreciated in the case of State of A.P.v.M. Madhusudhan Rao reported in (2008) 15 SCC 582.

19. There is no dispute from the case of prosecution that the PW1 was married to one Sri Satish and the said Satish died on 13/08/2015 as per Ex. P.7.

20. It appears from the defence that the accused No.1 did not admit the marriage with the PW1 rather had taken a specific defence that they lived in live-in- relationship at the house No.1047, I floor, K. N. Layout, 4th Cross, Triveni Road, within the limits of Yeshwanthapura Police Station, Bangalore. If the accused No.1 was lived in the relationship with the CW1, then, why he had to give wrong information and false documents to the Sub-Registrar, Kundapur that the marriage had taken place on 16/04/2017 and registered the marriage on 22/05/2017 as per Ex.P6. The accused No.1 did not explain under what circumstances, he was forced to submit the false information to the Sub- Registrar Kundapur for registering his marriage with PW1.

21. PW1 has not produced any source of income or any bills for having purchased 57 grams gold and given to the accused No.1 at the time of marriage to show that they had given alleged demanded dowry to the accused No.1 to 3. Added to which, the prosecution failed to prove that the accused No.1 to 3 were tortured and subjected the PW1 to cruelty for additional dowry.

KABC030523422020 CC No.13999/2020

22. No doubt, PW1 declared herself as unmarried instead of widow. However, the marital status of PW1 given at the time of marriage registration does not make her marriage nullity with the accused No.1 as she was legally competent to enter into the marriage with him. Though the accused No.1 through his entire defence had taken the contention that no marriage was taken place between the accused No.1 and the PW1 however he filed the petition for divorce before the Family Court, Bangalore and added to which, PW1 and the accused No.1 filed a joint memo by the order dated 23/12/2024 that they filed a mutual consent divorce petition in M. C. No.262/2024 on the file of Family Court, Udupi and demand draft of Rs.5,00,000/- was given as permanent alimony.

24. In the case of the KRISHNA vs STATE OF KARNATAKA reported in Laws(Kar) 2014 4 464, wherein KABC030523422020 CC No.13999/2020 it was held that ""it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and compromise between the victim and the wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to an end"".

26. Point No.3:- In view of the above findings and reasons given on point No.1 and 2, this Court proceeds to pass the following:

ORDER Acting U/Sec.248(1) of the Cr.P.C.

Sevanthi vs Aravind Kumar.P And Another on 4 January, 2025
The P.S.I., of Viveknagar Police Station, Bengaluru, has filed the present charge sheet against the accused No.1 and 2 for the offence punishable under sections 498A of Indian Penal Code and Secs.3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act.

2. BRIEF FACTS OF THE PROSECUTION CASE ARE AS UNDER :

It is the case of the complainant that, she was got married to the accused No.1 on 14.06.2021, thereafter, she led her matrimonial life in her matrimonial house situated at Building No.7, 1st Floor, 20th G Cross, Ejipura. Subsequently, the accused No.1 and 2 in furtherance of common intention have subjected the complainant physically and mentally into cruelty in order to bring dowry from her home. Based on the typed complaint lodged by C.W.1, C.W.9 registered the case against accused No.1 and 2 in P.S. Crime No.139/2021 for the offence punishable under sections 498(a) of IPC and Section 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. Investigating Officer after completion of the investigation has submitted final report against the accused No.1 and 2 for the above said offences.
C.C.No.56662/2022
3. Upon receipt of charge sheet, cognizance was taken for the offence alleged against the accused No.1 and 2 and registered the criminal case against them.

4. After registering the case, the accused No.1 and 2 have appeared and were released on bail as the accused No.1 and 2 have obtained anticipatory bail. Copy of the final report and it's enclosures were furnished to him in compliance of section 207 of Cr.P.C. Sufficient grounds were made out to frame charges. Hence, charges framed and read over to the accused persons. They pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

5. In order to prove the guilt of the accused persons, the prosecution has examined two witnesses out of ten witnesses cited in the charge sheet as P.W.1 & PW.2 and relied upon documents as per Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.5 and closed their side. In lieu of absence of incriminating circumstances appearing against accused No.1 and 2, recording of their statement under section 313 of Cr.P.C. was dispensed with.

6. Heard the arguments of both parties. Perused the materials on record.

7. The points that arise for my consideration are;

C.C.No.56662/2022

1. Whether the prosecution proves beyond all reasonable doubt that she was got married to the accused No.1 on 14.06.2021, thereafter, she led her matrimonial life in her matrimonial house situated at Building No.7, 1st Floor, 20th G Cross, Ejipura. Subsequently, the accused No.1 and 2 in furtherance of common intention have subjected the complainant physically and mentally into cruelty in order to bring dowry from her home and thereby committed an offence punishable U/s.498A R/w 34 of IPC ?

2. Whether the prosecution proves beyond all in furtherance of common intention have demanded dowry from CW.1 and thereby committed an offence punishable U/s.3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act ?

3. What Order?

8. My findings on the above points are as under:

         Point Nos.1 and 2       : In the Negative.
         Point No.3              : As per the final order
                                 for the following;

                                                C.C.No.56662/2022

                               REASONS

      9.      POINT Nos.1 and 2 :-

As these two points are interlinked, I have taken up these points together for common discussion to avoid repetition of facts & evidence.

In order to bring home the guilt of the accused persons, the prosecution has examined the complainant/victim/C.W.1 and the father of the complainant/CW.4 as P.W.1 and PW.2 respectively and relied upon five documents.

10. In order to bring home the guilt of the accused, the prosecution has examined the complainant / victim CW.1 as PW.1 and the father of the complainant/CW.4 as PW.2, wherein, the said witnesses have not supported the case of the prosecution. The learned APP appearing for the State with permission treated the said witnesses as hostile and fully cross examined them. Nothing has been elicited from the mouth of the PW.1 and 2 in order to prove the guilt of the accused.

11. On perusal of the materials on record and the oral & documentary evidence of P.W.1 and 2, they have categorically admitted that, they have compromised the matter with the accused. In view of the evidence of P.W.1 and 2, since the matter was compromised, the prayer of the learned Asst. Public Prosecutor for issuance of witness summons to other witnesses C.C.No.56662/2022 was rejected as no purpose would be served. As the P.W.1 and 2 have turned hostile to the case of the prosecution, the evidence on record is not at all helpful to substantiate the guilt of the accused persons. Hence, there is no cogent and convincing evidence against the accused persons. Accordingly, the benefit of doubt has to be extended to the accused No.1 and 2 and hence, the Point Nos.1 and 2 are answered in the ""Negative"".

12. Point No.3 :- In view of the findings on above points, I proceed to pass the following;

ORDER Acting under section 248(1) of Cr.P.C. the accused No.1 and 2 are acquitted of the offence punishable under sections 498A of Indian Penal Code and Secs.3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act.

The Bail bond and surety bonds of the accused persons shall be in force for the period of 6 months and thereafter it shall be cancelled without further orders.

                              *****

     The Police Sub-Inspector of Basavanagudi Women P.S. has

filed chargesheet against Accused for the offences punishable U/s.

498A, 504, 506 r/w/s 34 of IPC. & Sec.4 of D.P. Act.

     2. The criminal law has been set into motion based on the

first information statement of     Smt. Salma. The gist of the

prosecution case is that the Accused No.1 married CW-1 on 01-04-

2021. After the marriage, the accused persons with common

intention have subjected CW-1 to mental and physical cruelty in

respect of dowry and demanded to get Rs.Five lakhs from her

parents and when she refused, accused persons have abused her

in filthy language with an intention to provoke her to commit

breach of peace and criminally intimidated to do away with her life.
                                       3

                                                                  C.C.No.2125/2023
Based on the said information, a case in Cr.No.252/2022 came to

be registered against the accused for the aforesaid offences.

     3.     After   completion   of       the    investigation,    the   P.SI   of

Basavanagudi Women P.S. has filed chargesheet against accused

for the aforesaid offences. On receipt of charge sheet, this court

took cognizance of the alleged offences. Pursuant to the issuance

and service of summons, accused                 entered appearance and were

enlarged on bail. The prosecution papers was furnished to the

accused as required U/s.207 of Cr.P.C.

     4. Before framing charge an opportunity of being heard was

provided to the        accused and after hearing them and the

prosecution and as there was sufficient materials, the charge for

the aforesaid offences was framed and same was read over to the

accused in the language known to them,                 to which, the accused

pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The plea of the accused

was recorded. Thereafter, the matter was set down for prosecution

evidence.


     5. In order to prove the charges, the prosecution has

examined PW-1 and got marked Ex.P.1 and P.2 documents.                          As

there was no any incriminating evidence appearing against the
                                4

                                                        C.C.No.2125/2023
accused, the recording of Statement of Accused as required U/s.

313 of Cr.P.C., was dispensed with.


     6. Heard arguments on both the sides. I have Perused the

materials on record.

     7. The following points arise for my determination:-

     1) Whether the prosecution proves beyond all reasonable
     doubt that the accused persons caused physical and
     mental cruelty to the complainant in demand of dowry
     abused her in filthy language and threatened to kill her
     and    thereby accused have committed the offences
     punishable U/s. 498A, 504, 506 r/w/s 34 of IPC. &
     Sec.4 of D.P. Act?

     2) what order?


     8. My finding to the above points are as under:-

     Point No.1 ........In the Negative.
     Point No.2........ As per final order, for the following:



                           REASONS

     9. POINT No.1 :- It is the fundamental principle of criminal

jurisprudence that the prosecution has to prove its case beyond

reasonable doubt. In order to bring home the guilt of the accused,

the prosecution has examined one witness as PW-1          got marked
                                5

                                                    C.C.No.2125/2023
Ex.P.1 and Ex.P2 documents. Ex.P1 is the first information

statement. Ex.P.2 is the spot panchanama.

     10. CW-1 was examined as PW-1. She in her examination-in-

chief has deposed that her marriage with accused         No.1 was

performed on 01-04-2021 and deposed after the marriage, accused

looked after her well and deposed accused did not subject her to

any physical and mental cruelty in demand of dowry      and never

abused her in filthy language and did not gave life threat to her.

PW-1 deposed     that there was    petty quarrel between her and

accused   in respect to family issues, for which she went to the

police station. There the police have took her signatures on

documents. PW-1 identified Ex.P.1 first information statement and

also identified her signature at Ex.P1. PW-1 also identified Ex.P.2

spot Panchanama and her signature at Ex.P2 and she pleaded her

ignorance about the contents of Ex.P.1 and P.2. The learned Sr.APP

treated PW-1 as hostile witness and cross examined her. During

which PW-1 admitted that she and accused have compromised the

matter and denied all other suggestions.

     11. On appreciation of entire     materials on record,    it is

apparent that PW-1 being the informant, key and material witness

have turned hostile to the prosecution case. Therefore, this court
                                  6

                                                         C.C.No.2125/2023
was pleased to reject the prayer of the learned Sr.APP to summon

other chargesheeted witnesses. Even, if the summons was issued to

other chargesheeted witnesses, no purpose would be served as the

material witness has given go-bye to her own statement and also

the valuable time of the court would be saved. As such other charge

sheeted witnesses were dropped and prosecution evidence was

taken as closed. In view of the material witness, turning hostile the

prosecution has failed to bring home the guilt of the accused

beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I answer Point No.1 in the

Negative.

      12. POINT No.2:- For the foregoing reasons, I proceed to pass

the following:

                              ORDER

Based on the typed complaint lodged by C.W.1, C.W.6 registered the case against accused in P.S. Crime No.6/24 for the offence punishable under sections 498(a) of IPC and Section 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. Investigating Officers after completion of the investigation has submitted final report against the accused for the above said offence.
C.CNo.70955/2024
3. Upon receipt of charge sheet, cognizance was taken for the offence alleged against the accused and registered the criminal case against him.

4. After registering the case, the accused has appeared and was released on bail. Copy of the final report and it's enclosures were furnished to him in compliance of section 207 of Cr.P.C. Sufficient grounds were made out to frame charges. Hence, charges framed and read over to the accused. He pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

5. In order to prove the guilt of the accused, the prosecution has examined the complainant/CW.1 as PW.1 out of 08 witnesses cited in the charge sheet and relied upon documents as per Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.6 and closed its side. In lieu of absence of incriminating circumstances appearing against accused, recording of his examination as provided under section 313 of Cr.P.C. was dispensed with.

6. Heard the arguments of both parties. Perused the materials on record.

C.CNo.70955/2024

7. The points that arise for my consideration are;

1. Whether the prosecution proves beyond all reasonable doubt that the accused was married with her on 12.02.2012 and out of the wedlock, they had daughter, the accused under the influence of alcohol used to abuse the complainant in filthy language and used to beat her with regard to the demand of dowry and subjected the complainant to cruelty both physically and mentally and thereby committed an offence punishable U/s.498A of IPC ?

2. Whether the prosecution proves beyond all reasonable doubt that, the accused has demanded C.W.1 for Rs.20,00,000/- as dowry, accordingly CW.4 along with the parents of CW.1 have given Rs.20,00,000/- to the accused, even then the accused used to harass the complainant both physically and mentally and thereby committed an offence punishable U/s.3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act ?

C.CNo.70955/2024

3. What Order?

8. My findings on the above points are as under:

              Point Nos.1 and 2       : In the Negative.
              Point No.3              : As per the final order
                                        for the following;

                               REASONS

      9.      POINT Nos.1 and 2 :-

As these two points are interlinked, I have taken up these points together for common discussion to avoid repetition of facts & evidence.

In order to bring home the guilt of the accused persons, the prosecution has examined the complainant/victim/C.W.1 as P.W.1 and relied upon five documents.

10. In order to bring home the guilt of the accused, the prosecution has examined the complainant / victim CW.1 as PW.1, wherein, the said witness has not supported the case of the prosecution. The learned APP appearing for the State with permission treated the said witness as hostile and fully cross examined her. Nothing has been elicited from the mouth of the PW.1 in order to prove the guilt of the accused.

C.CNo.70955/2024

11. On perusal of the materials on record and the oral & documentary evidence of P.W.1, she has categorically admitted that, she has compromised the matter with the accused and she is leading her marital life with the accused. In view of the evidence of P.W.1, since the matter was compromised, the prayer of the learned Asst. Public Prosecutor for issuance of witness summons to other witnesses was rejected as no purpose would be served. As the P.W.1 has turned hostile to the case of the prosecution, the evidence on record is not at all helpful to substantiate the guilt of the accused. Hence, there is no cogent and convincing evidence against the accused.. Accordingly, the benefit of doubt has to be extended to the accused No.1 and hence, the Point Nos.1 and 2 are answered in the ""Negative"".

12. Point No.3 :- In view of the findings on above points, I proceed to pass the following;

ORDER Acting under section 248(1) of Cr.P.C. the accused is acquitted of the offence punishable under sections 498A of Indian Penal Code and Secs.3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act.

The personal bond of the accused shall be in force for the period of 6 C.CNo.70955/2024 months and thereafter it shall be cancelled without further orders.

Thus, it is clear from the cross examination of PW1 that the differences of opinion between the accused and PW1 have been settled and they were living together under one roof. Under this background, this court feels it is a waste of precious time of the Court in examining other witnesses. Moreover the evidence of other witnesses is only formal in nature. Therefore, the prayer of learned Sr.APP is rejected and prosecution evidence is taken as closed and hence the offence under section 498A of IPC with other offences under section 324, 506 of IPC cannot be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, this court answer the point No.1 to 3 in the Negative.
KABC030452592023 CC No.25621/2023
16. Point No.4:- In view of the above findings and reasons given on point No.1 to 3, this Court proceeds to pass the following:

In this regard, the learned Sr.APP cross examined this witness by treating her as hostile witness but no favorable answer has been elicited from her to support the prosecution case. In her cross examination she deposed that:
ನಾನು ಮತ್ತು ಆರೋಪಿಯವರು ದಿ.17- 02-2014 ರಂದು ಹಿಂದೂ ಸಂಪ್ರದಾಯದಂತೆ ವಿವಾಹ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಂಡಿರುತ್ತೇವೆ ಮತ್ತು ಮದುವೆಯಾದ ನಂತರ ಪುಣೆಯಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಆರೋಪಿ ಮನೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಸಂಸಾರ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಂಡಿದ್ದೆವು, ಸದರಿ ಮದುವೆಯಿಂದ ಒಂದು ಗಂಡು ಮಗು ಇದೆ ಎಂದರೆ ಸರಿ.

Thus, it is clear that the marriage between the PW1 and the accused is dissolved by the decree of divorce on the file of Anand Family Court at Gujrath in family Suit No. 185/2021 and more so the informant cum victim did not support the prosecution case. Though the prosecution has cross examined KABC030225382019 CC No.7529/2019 her by treating as hostile witness, no favorable answers has been elicited from her to support the prosecution case. Under this background, this court opines that it is a waste of precious time of Court in examining other witnesses. Moreover the evidence of other witnesses would be only formal in nature. Therefore, the prayer of learned Sr.APP is rejected and prosecution evidence is taken as closed. The ingridents of the offence under section 498A of IPC was not proved beyond reasonable doubt.

Thereafter he was convicted by the Trial Court vide judgment dated 12/07/2018 passed in Special Case No.1300007/2014 and owing to the conviction of the petitioner vide order dated 22/07/2021, provisional pension payable to the petitioner was stopped on permanent basis under Rule 9(1) of Madhya Pradesh Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1976.

4. It is argued that against the judgment of conviction, petitioner has preferred Criminal Appeal No.5274/2018, wherein vide order dated 06/10/2018, sentence awarded to the petitioner has been suspended. The Authorities without following the procedure as provided under Pension Rules, 1976 and without supplying the copy of recommendation of Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission has passed the impugned order directing for stoppage of future amount of pension to be disbursed to the petitioner. It is pointed out that petitioner was only released 50% provisional pension and no amount towards gratuity was released to him. He submitted repeated representations before respondents No.1 & 2 but of no consequence. It is argued that retiral dues including pension is not a bounty and is a statutory right of the Government employee. Therefore, action taken by the Authorities is per se illegal. It is submitted that once the petitioner has attained the age of superannuation, it is only the Governor of the State who is having power NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:543 to direct for stoppage of pension of the petitioner. The direction for stoppage of pension can only be issued after providing opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. Learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance on the order dated 03.08.2021 passed by Division Bench of this Court at Gwalior in the case of Radha Krishna Sharma Vs. State of M.P. and Ors. in Writ Appeal No.875/2020 wherein similar issue was considered by the Court and Writ Appeal was allowed and the impugned order of withdrawing of pension of petitioner in entirety under Rule 9 of Pension Rules, 1976 was quashed. The same principle is applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case also. Therefore, he prayed for quashment of impugned orders.

5. On notice being issued, a detailed reply has been filed by the Authorities. It is pointed out that petitioner stood convicted in a criminal case registered for offence under Sections 7, 13(1)(d), 13(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 vide judgment of conviction dated 12/07/2018 passed in Special Case No.1300007/2014. He was sentenced for RI of 4 years and fine of Rs.500/- under Section 7 of Prevention of Corruption Act and RI of 4 years and fine of Rs.500/- under Section 13(1)(d) read with 13(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act. It is argued that there is an amendment in Rule 64 of Pension Rules, 1976 vide amendment dated 19/05/2023 which has been made applicable with effect from 12/12/1990. If the said amendment is taken note of, then no amount of gratuity shall be paid to the Government servant until the conclusion of the departmental and judicial proceedings and issuance of final orders thereon. Under these circumstances, the Authorities have rightly passed the impugned orders.

6. Rejoinder to the return has been filed pointing out the fact that criminal proceedings have been initiated against the petitioner on NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:543 27/11/2014, whereas petitioner stood retired on 31/10/2014 on attaining the age of superannuation. Petitioner has been deprived of the gratuity amount in spite of any orders being passed by the Authorities. Respondents have failed to appreciate the note appended to Rule 64 of Pension Rules, 1976, wherein it is provided that provisional pension under Rule 64 would be mandatory in case if judicial proceedings are continued. It is submitted that since the criminal appeal is pending consideration and the sentence has been suspended, therefore the Authorities have no legal right to withhold the provisional pension of the petitioner as well as gratuity.

7. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and perused the record.

8. From perusal of record, it is seen that the admitted position being that the petitioner on attaining the age of superannuation stood retired on 31/10/2014. Thereafter, provisional pension was released vide order dated 19/11/2014 passed by Commissioner, Food Supply and Consumer Protection. The order dated 22/07/2021 (Annexure-P/10) reflects that the criminal case at Crime No.193/2014 for offence under Sections 7, 13(1)(d), 13(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act was registered against the petitioner on 15/05/2014 and the matter was taken up for investigation by the Police Authorities. He was convicted vide judgment dated 12/07/2018 passed in Special Case No.1300007/2014 for offence under Sections 7, 13(1)(d) r/w 13(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act and sentenced for four years RI with fine of Rs.500/- and four years RI with fine of Rs.500/- respectively with default stipulations. This clearly goes to establish that criminal case against the petitioner was registered prior to retirement of the petitioner. During the pendency of criminal trial, petitioner stood superannuated, therefore order of grant of provision pension was issued but now the petitioner stood convicted by NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:543 judgment dated 12/07/2018, against which he preferred Cr.A. No.5274/2018 before this Court which is pending consideration and vide order dated 06/10/2018, his jail sentence has been suspended. Thereafter, a decision was taken by the Authorities after taking opinion from Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission to stop the provisional pension of the petitioner and the order impugned has been passed under the signature of the Governor of the State.

9. Rule 9(1) of Pension Rules, 1976 is relevant and it reads as under:-

""9. Right of Governor to withhold or withdraw pension.-(1) The Governor reserves to himself the right of withholding or withdrawing a pension or part thereof, whether permanently or for a specified period, and of ordering recovery from pension of the whole or part of any pecuniary loss caused to the Government if, in any departmental or judicial proceeding, the pensioner is found guilty of grave misconduct or negligence during the period of his service, including service rendered upon re- employment after retirement:
Provided that the State Public Service Commission shall be consulted before any final orders are passed: Provided further that where a part of pension is withheld or withdrawn, the amount of such pension shall not be reduced below the minimum pension as determined by the Government from time to time.""
10. If the aforesaid rule is perused, then it is seen that the opinion from the State Public Service Commission is to be taken and thereafter the sanction from the Governor is required in the matter.

11. In the present case, opinion from the State Public Service Commission was taken in the matter. Thereafter, an amendment in Rule 64 of Pension Rules, 1976 was carried out which was made effected from 12/12/1990. The said amendment reads as under:-

NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:543 ""R.N. 816/3600/2022/RULE/IV In exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to article 309 of the Constitution of India, the Governor of Madhya Pradesh, hereby makes the following further amendment in the Madhya Pradesh Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1976, namely :-
AMENDMENT In the said rules, for rule 64, the following rule shall be substituted namely -
""64. Provisional pension, where departmental or judicial proceedings may be pending :-
(1)(a) In respect of a Government servant referred to in sub-rule (4) of rule 9, the Head of office shall authorize the provisional pension equal to the maximum pension which would have been admissible on the basis of qualifying service upto the date of retirement of the Government servant, or if he was under
suspension on the date of retirement upto the date immediately preceding the date on which he was placed under suspension ;
(b) The provisional pension shall be drawn on establishment pay bill and paid to the retired Government servant by the Head of office during the period commencing from the date of retirement upto and including the date on which, after the conclusion of departmental or judicial proceedings, final orders are passed by the competent authority;
(c) No gratuity shall be paid to the Government servant until the conclusion of the departmental or judicial proceedings and issue of final orders thereon ;
provided that where departmental proceedings have been instituted under rule 16 of the Madhya Pradesh Civil Services (Classification Control and Appeal) Rules, 1966, for imposing any of the penalties specified in clause (i), (ii) and (iv) of rule 10 of the said rules, the payment of provisional gratuity to the extent of 90% of the gratuities NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:543 admissible under the rules shall also be authorized to be paid to the Government servant.

(2) Provisional gratuity shall be drawn on establishment pay bill and paid to the retired Government servant by the Head of office after adjusting dues mentioned in sub-rule (2) of rule 60 under intimation to audit office.

Payment of provisional pension / gratuity made under sub-rule (1) shall be adjusted against final retirement benefits sanctioned to such Government servant upon conclusion of such proceedings, but recovery shall not be made where the pension/gratuity finally sanctioned is less than the provisional pension/gratuity or the pension/gratuity is reduced or withheld either permanently or for a specified period.

Note : Grant of provisional pension under rule 64 is mandatory even if departmental or judicial proceedings is continued."".

2. This amendment shall be deemed to have been come into force form 12th December, 1990.

e/;izns""k ds jkT;iky ds uke ls rFkk vkns""kkuqlkj] vthr dqekj] lfpo""

12. From perusal of the said amendment, it is evident that no gratuity shall be paid to the Government servant until the conclusion of the departmental or judicial proceedings and issue of final order thereon.
13. In the present case, there is a direction issued by the Authorities to stop the provisional pension of the petitioner and to withhold the gratuity amount on the ground that petitioner stood convicted in a criminal case registered under Prevention of Corruption Act.
14. It is argued by learned counsel for the petitioner that prior to passing such order, no opportunity of hearing was granted to the petitioner. The fact remains that the provision does not contemplate NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:543 grant of any opportunity of hearing to the delinquent employee who stood convicted in a criminal case prior to passing any order for stoppage of pension.
15. It is an admitted position that petitioner has been convicted for a period of 4 years under the provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act. Merely suspension of sentence in a Criminal Appeal does not entitle the petitioner for grant of pension. The conviction still remains and only the sentence is suspended by this Court in Criminal Appeal.
16. This Court in the case of Sobran Singh Sikarwar Vs. The State of Madhya Pradesh and others decided on 28/08/2024 in Writ Petition No.5759/2017 has considered the similar issue and has held as under:
""6. The undisputed facts in this petition are that the petitioner has been convicted vide judgement dated 28/3/2012 passed by VII Additional Sessions Judge, Gwalior in S.T. No. 6/2011 for the offences punishable under sections 302 read with 34 of the IPC, 498A of the IPC and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. In criminal appeal having been preferred, the custodial sentence has been suspended vide order dated 5/4/2013. Petitioner's prayer for grant of pensionary benefits or reinstatement in service as he has not been placed under suspension nor his services have been terminated by the Authorities, cannot be considered for the reason that petitioner is a convicted employee. He has been found guilty of committing the offences as detailed above. Similar issue came for consideration before the Full Bench of this Court in the case of Lal Saheb Bairagi (Supra), wherein it has been held as under:-
14. The Rule 8(2) enables the authority to exercise power under Rule 8(1)(b) upon conviction of serious crime in the light of the Judgment of the criminal court. While doing so, it must consider whether his NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:543 conduct which has led to his conviction was such as warrants the withholding/withdrawing of pension. For that purpose it will have to peruse the judgment of the criminal court and consider all the facts and circumstances of the case. This, however, has to be done by it ex parte and by itself and without hearing the concerned pensioner reason of the exclusionary effect of the starting words of Rule 8(3) upon exercise of powers under Rule 8(2) of the 1976 Rules.
15. In view of the law laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of Tulsiram (supra), which is fully applicable to the present case as well, the authority must, however, bear in mind that a conviction on a criminal charge does not automatically entail withdrawal or withholding of pension. This can be done in the light of the judgment of the Court relating to such conviction. No direction for taking action in the judgment of the criminal Court is necessary or required for taking action under Rule 8(2) of the Rules of 1976. This authoritative judgment of the Supreme Court was completely overlooked by the learned Single Bench while deciding Dau Ram Maheshwar case (supra) on the basis of decision of Chhatisgarh High Court. The majority view in Ram Sewak Mishra (supra) wrongly did not apply the decision of Tulsi Ram Patel (supra) to the Rules of 1976. On the other hand the earlier Full Bench in Laxmi Narayan Hayaran v. State of M.P. reported in 2004 (4) MPLJ 555 after considering the relevant case law including Tulsiram Patel (supra), correctly held that no prior hearing is required NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:543 before passing an order under Rule 8(2) of 1976 Rules consequent upon conviction.
***

17. The answer to the questions referred to this Larger Bench is given accordingly by clearly stating that:-

(i) The principles of natural justice are specifically and expressly excluded and have no application to the cases falling under Rule 8(2) of 1976 Rules in view of the opening words of Rule 8(2) of the Rules of 1976, therefore, when an action is taken against the pensioner under Rule 8(2) of the Rules of 1976, no notice is required to be issued to the pensioner nor can he insists upon prior opportunity of representation on the strength of the principles of Natural Justice.
(ii) The decision of the Full Bench in the case of Ram Sewak Mishra (supra) and the decision in the case of Dau Ram Maheshwar (supra) are hereby over-ruled.
(iii) It is held that the authority is not required to issue notice or afford prior opportunity of representation before passing the order under Rule 8(2) of the Pension Rules of 1976, in respect of a pensioner who has been convicted in the criminal cases. However, the power of the authority to take action under the Rules would be subject to the guidelines as stated by the Supreme Court in the case of Tulsiram Patel (supra) and reiterated by this Bench in the preceding paragraphs of this judgment.""
7. Recently, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No. 7437-7438 of 2021 (The Secretary Local Self Government Department & Others Etc. Vs. K.Chandran Etc.) has held that after conviction, the employee is not entitled to claim NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:543 pension or any other retiral dues even though his criminal appeal against conviction is pending before the High Court. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ram Ratan Tiwari Vs. State of M.P. and Others (2002 (5) MPHT 11) has held that criminal appeal is not continuation of trial, therefore, in terms of the provisions of Rule 8 of the Pension Rules, 1976, an employee convicted for a serious offence is not entitled for claiming pensionary benefits.""

17. The Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of K.C. Sareen Vs. CBI, Chandigarh reported in (2001) 6 SCC 584 has held as under:-

""10. A three-Judge Bench of this Court has elaborately considered the scope and ambit of the powers of the appellate court envisaged in Section 389 of the Code (vide Rama Narang v. Ramesh Narang [(1995) 2 SCC 513] ). Ahmadi, C.J., who authored the judgment for the Bench said that what can be suspended under Section 389(1) of the Code is the execution of the sentence or execution of the order and obviously the ""order"" referred to in the sub-section must be an order which is capable of execution. Learned Chief Justice then observed thus:
(SCC p. 524, para 15) ""An order of conviction by itself is not capable of execution under the Code. It is the order of sentence or an order awarding compensation or imposing fine or release on probation which are capable of execution and which, if not suspended, would be required to be executed by the authorities. Since the order of conviction does not on the mere filing of an appeal disappear it is difficult to accept the submission that Section 267 of the Companies Act must be read to apply only to a „final‟ order of conviction. Such an interpretation may defeat the very object and purpose for which it came to be enacted.""
Nevertheless, the three-Judge Bench further stated that in a certain situation the order of conviction can be executable and in such a case the power under NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:543 Section 389(1) of the Code could be invoked. The ratio of the judgment can be traced out in the said paragraph which is extracted below: (SCC pp. 524- 25, para 16) ""16. In certain situations the order of conviction can be executable, in the sense, it may incur a disqualification as in the instant case. In such a case the power under Section 389(1) of the Code could be invoked. In such situations the attention of the appellate court must be specifically invited to the consequences which are likely to fall to enable it to apply its mind to the issue since under Section 389(1) it is under an obligation to support its order „for reasons to be recorded by it in writing‟. If the attention of the court is not invited to this specific consequence which is likely to fall upon conviction how can it be expected to assign reasons relevant thereto? No one can be allowed to play hide and seek with the court; he cannot suppress the precise purpose for which he seeks suspension of the conviction and obtain a general order of stay and then contend that the disqualification has ceased to operate.""

11. The legal position, therefore, is this: though the power to suspend an order of conviction, apart from the order of sentence, is not alien to Section 389(1) of the Code, its exercise should be limited to very exceptional cases. Merely because the convicted person files an appeal in challenge of the conviction the court should not suspend the operation of the order of conviction. The court has a duty to look at all aspects including the ramifications of keeping such conviction in abeyance. It is in the light of the above legal position that we have to examine the question as to what should be the position when a public servant is convicted of an offence under the PC Act. No doubt when the appellate court admits the appeal filed in challenge of the conviction and sentence for the offence under the PC Act, the NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:543 superior court should normally suspend the sentence of imprisonment until disposal of the appeal, because refusal thereof would render the very appeal otiose unless such appeal could be heard soon after the filing of the appeal. But suspension of conviction of the offence under the PC Act, dehors the sentence of imprisonment as a sequel thereto, is a different matter.

12. Corruption by public servants has now reached a monstrous dimension in India. Its tentacles have started grappling even the institutions created for the protection of the republic. Unless those tentacles are intercepted and impeded from gripping the normal and orderly functioning of the public offices, through strong legislative, executive as well as judicial exercises the corrupt public servants could even paralyse the functioning of such institutions and thereby hinder the democratic polity. Proliferation of corrupt public servants could garner momentum to cripple the social order if such men are allowed to continue to manage and operate public institutions. When a public servant is found guilty of corruption after a judicial adjudicatory process conducted by a court of law, judiciousness demands that he should be treated as corrupt until he is exonerated by a superior court. The mere fact that an appellate or revisional forum has decided to entertain his challenge and to go into the issues and findings made against such public servants once again should not even temporarily absolve him from such findings. If such a public servant becomes entitled to hold public office and to continue to do official acts until he is judicially absolved from such findings by reason of suspension of the order of conviction, it is public interest which suffers and sometimes, even irreparably. When a public servant who is convicted of corruption is allowed to continue to hold public office, it would impair the morale of the other persons manning such office, and consequently that would erode the already shrunk confidence of the people in such public institutions besides NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:543 demoralising the other honest public servants who would either be the colleagues or subordinates of the convicted person. If honest public servants are compelled to take orders from proclaimed corrupt officers on account of the suspension of the conviction, the fallout would be one of shaking the system itself. Hence it is necessary that the court should not aid the public servant who stands convicted for corruption charges to hold only (sic) public office until he is exonerated after conducting a judicial adjudication at the appellate or revisional level. It is a different matter if a corrupt public officer could continue to hold such public office even without the help of a court order suspending the conviction.""

18. There is no dispute with respect to the fact that petitioner stood convicted vide judgment of conviction dated 12/07/2018 against which Criminal Appeal is pending. He is held guilty and stands convicted. There is no stay on his conviction. Only sentence is suspended. Merely getting a suspension of sentence does not entitle the petitioner for grant of pension and gratuity. Learned counsel for the petitioner has failed to point out any law or statutory provision which entitles the petitioner for grant of pension or gratuity during the pendency of criminal appeal after his conviction.

19. Under these circumstances, no relief can be extended to the petitioner.

20. The petition sans merit and is accordingly dismissed. No order as to costs.

Kuldeep Seth vs State Of U.P. And Another ,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/180755086/,"Allahabad High Court
Kuldeep Seth vs State Of U.P. And Another on 6 January, 2025
1. Supplementary affidavit filed on behalf of applicant is taken on record.

2. Heard learned counsel for the applicant, learned counsel for the opposite party no.2 and learned A.G.A. for the State.

3. This application u/s 482 has been filed by the applicant with the prayer to quash the entire proceedings including the impugned charge sheet dated 06.03.2022 as well as cognizance / summoning order dated 20.04.2022 passed by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Banda in Case No.1960/IX/2022, (State versus Kuldeep Seth and others) arising out of Case Crime No.88 of 2022, under Sections 498-A, 323, 506 IPC & 3/4 D.P. Act, Police Station Kotwali Nagar, District Banda, pending in the Court of learned First Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Banda in pursuance of the compromise dated 27.10.2023 verified by the first Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Banda dated 13.08.2024.

4. Earlier application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. No.12505 of 2022 was filed by Kuldeep Seth and 3 others, wherein, the following order was passed on 26.05.2022 by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court :-

""Sri Pankaj Shukla, Advocate has already filed his power on behalf of opposite party no.2, but his name is not shown in the cause list.
Heard Sri Diwakar Tiwari, Advocate holding brief of Sri Gyanendra Singh, learned counsel for the applicants, Sri Pankaj Shukla, learned counsel for the opposite party no.2, Sri Arvind Kumar, learned AGA for the State and perused the record of the case.
By way of present application, applicants made prayer to quash the charge-sheet dated 06.03.2022, cognizance and summoning order dated 20.04.2022 and proceedings of Case No. 1960/IX/22 (State Vs. Kuldeep Seth and others) arising out of Case Crime No. 88 of 2022, under Sections 498A, 323, 506 IPC and 3/4 D.P. Act, Police Station Kotwali Nagar, District Banda.
Learned counsel for the applicants submitted that opposite party no.2 is the wife of applicant no.1 and applicant nos. 2 and 3 are her in-laws, while applicant no.4 is her brother-in-law (Jeth). He further submitted that totally on the basis of false allegation, opposite party no.2 lodged FIR of the present case against the applicant no.1, the husband and his family members. He further submitted that neither applicant no.1 nor rest of the applicants ever harassed her nor demanded any dowry from opposite party no.2 and without any proper investigation in routine manner the charge-sheet has been filed. He further submitted that as far as case of applicant nos. 2 to 4 are concerned, their case are distinguishable from the case of applicant no.1, the husband and there is no specific allegation against the applicant nos. 2 to 4 either in the FIR or in the statement of opposite party no.2 recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C., therefore, at least indulgence of this Court is required in respect of applicants 2, 3 and 4.
Per contra, learned AGA and learned counsel for the opposite party no.2 submitted that there is specific allegation of torture and demand of dowry against applicant no.1, the husband. Learned counsel for the opposite party no.2 vehemently submitted that when opposite party no.2 informed about the cruelty done by the applicant no.1 to applicant nos. 2 and 3, her in-laws, then applicants 2 and 3 also started taking favour of applicant no.1 and also started demand of dowry, therefore, perusal of the FIR and the statement of opposite party no.2 recorded under Sections 161 and 164 Cr.P.C. discloses cognizable offence under Sections 498A, 323, 506 IPC and 3/4 D.P. Act, therefore, application of applicants is liable to be dismissed.
I have heard both the parties and perused the record of the case. Admittedly, applicants 2 and 3 are in-laws of opposite party no.2 and applicant no.4 is Jeth of opposite party no.2 and specific allegation in the FIR has been made only against applicant no.1, the husband and also in the statement of opposite party no.2 recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. As, applicants 2 and 3 are in-laws of opposite party no.2 and applicant no.4 is Jeth, therefore, their case are distinguishable from the case of applicant no.1, the husband, therefore, in respect of applicants 2, 3 and 4, namely, Kripashankar Seth, Smt. Indu Seth and Deepak Seth, matter requires consideration.
Learned Government Advocate has accepted notice on behalf of the State/opposite party no.1.
Sri Pankaj Shukla, Advocate has already appeared on behalf of opposite party no.2. He prays for and is granted two weeks time to file counter affidavit. Rejoinder affidavit, if any, may be filed by the applicant within two weeks thereafter.
List this case on 26.07.2022. When the case is listed next, the name of Sri Pankaj Shukla, Advocate be shown as counsel for the opposite party no.2.
Till the next date of listing, no coercive action shall be taken against the applicants 2, 3 and 4, namely, Kripashankar Seth, Smt. Indu Seth and Deepak Seth.
As far as, the case of applicant no.1, namely, Kuldeep Seth, the husband of opposite party no.2, is concerned, there is specific allegation of cruelty and harassment to opposite party no.2, therefore, application of applicant no.1, namely Kuldeep Seth is rejected.""
5. Subsequently, during pendency of the aforesaid application, the parties have entered into compromise, therefore, on 29.07.2024, the following order was passed by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court :-

""1. Heard Sri Gyanendra Singh, learned counsel for the applicants, Sri Vishal Mohan Gupta, Advocate holding brief of Sri Punit Kumar Gupta, learned counsel for the opposite party no. 2 and Sri Ajay Singh-I, learned counsel for State.
2. Learned counsel for the applicants argued that the parties have entered into compromise, copy of which is annexed as annexure no. S.A.-1 to the supplementary affidavit. It is argued that as such the present proceedings be quashed.
4. Looking to the facts of the case, it is provided that the applicants shall file the said compromise within a period of two weeks from today before the court concerned who shall verify the same within two weeks thereafter and send his report to this Court.
5. List on 09.09.2024.
6. Till the next date of listing, no coercive action shall be taken against the applicants, namely, Kuldeep Seth, Kripashankar Seth, Smt. Indu Seth and Deepak Seth in Case No. 1960/IX/22 (State vs. Kuldseep Seth and others) arising out of Case Crime No. 88 of 2022, under Sections 498-A, 323, 506 IPC and 3/4 D.P. Act, P.S. Kotwali Nagar, District Banda, pending in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Banda.
7. Learned counsels for the parties are also at liberty to file the order of compromise through an affidavit in the present matter. ""
6. The parties including the applicant-Kuldeep Seth appeared before the Court concerned for verification of the compromise. As the case of husband was rejected by earlier order of this Court but in the light of the compromise dated 17.09.2024 proceedings against Kripa Shanker Seth, Indu Seth and Deepak Seth were quashed in the light of the compromise which was verified in compliance of the order of this Court.

7. The present application has been filed with respect to Kuldeep Seth which can be taken as second application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. under change circumstances. This Court finds while verifying the compromise Kuldeep Seth had appeared before the Court concerned and in presence of all the parties compromise has been verified by order dated 13.08.2024, certified copy of the order has been annexed on page no.7 of the supplementary affidavit filed today.

8. In the interest of justice, it would not be appropriate to linger the matter and sent the matter for verification of the compromise again. As applicant has already appeared before the Court concerned while the compromise was being verified in compliance of earlier order of this Court.

9. Sri Devendra Mishra, learned counsel for the opposite party no.2 does not dispute the aforesaid facts and admits that compromise between the parties has been verified.

10. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that since the compromise entered between the parties has been verified by the court below, the entire proceedings of the aforesaid criminal case may be quashed by this Court.

11. Learned A.G.A. for the State as well as learned counsel for the opposite party no.2 also accept that the parties have entered into a compromise and the copy of the same has also been enclosed along with verification order, they have no objection, if the proceedings in the aforesaid case are quashed.

12. This Court is not unmindful of the following judgements of the Apex Court:

(i). B.S. Joshi and others Vs. State of Haryana and Another; (2003)4 SCC 675,
(ii). Nikhil Merchant Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation; (2008) 9 SCC 677,
(iii). Manoj Sharma Vs. State and Others; (2008) 16 SCC 1,
(iv). Gian Singh Vs. State of Punjab; (2012); 10 SCC 303,
(v). Narindra Singh and others Vs. State of Punjab; ( 2014) 6 SCC 466,

Coram: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE PRADEEP KUMAR SRIVASTAVA


                                JUDGMENT
Dated- 06.01.2025 By Court:- Heard Ms. Swati Shalini, learned counsel appearing for the appellants as well as Mr. Bishwambhar Shatri, learned A.P.P. appearing for the State.

2. Instant appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 10th July, 2006 and 11th July, 2006 passed by Additional Sessions Judge Ghatshila, East Singhbhum in Sessions Trial Case No. 461 of 2004, whereby and whereunder both the appellants were held guilty and convicted under Section 306/34 of the I.P.C. Appellant no.1 was directed to undergo seven years of R.I., and Appellant Page | 1 no.2 was directed to undergo five years of R.I. Factual Matrix

3. The prosecution case is that the deceased was married with the accused no.1 (Samir Maity) on 26/05/2003 and the deceased had been living a happy life in her matrimonial home. On 13.05.2004, the father of the deceased received a telephonic message that his daughter has sustained severe burn injuries and she had been taken to hospital for treatment. Upon the said information, the informant reached at the matrimonial house of his daughter and got information that his daughter had died due to burn injuries and her body was sent for post-mortem. It is further urged by the informant that his daughter was subjected to cruelty for demand of additional dowry.

4. On the basis of aforesaid information, F.I.R. being Behragoda (Barsol) P.S. Case No. 29/2004 was registered against both accused persons for the offences under Sections 498A, 304B and 201 of the Indian Penal Code.

5. After completion of investigation, charge-sheet was submitted and accordingly, cognizance was taken under Sections 498A, 304B and 201 of the Indian Penal Code and the case was committed to Court of Sessions where appellants pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

6. In order to substantiate the charges leveled against all accused persons, altogether six witnesses were examined by the prosecution.


Page | 2

7. Apart from oral evidence of ocular witnesses, following documentary evidences were also adduced.

Exhibit 1 : Signature of Pashupati Nath Bhuiyan. Exhibit 2 : Post mortem report.

Exhibit 3 : Formal F.I.R.

Exhibit 1/1: Fard Beyan Exhibit 4: Inquest Report.

8. The case of defence is denial from the charge and further defence is that appellants are innocent who have not committed any offence and they have been falsely implicated in this case.

9. After conclusion of trial the learned trial court, after appraisal of the evidence available on record, held the appellants guilty for the offences under Section 306/34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced as stated above.

10. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that offence under Section 306 I.P.C. could not be said to be minor offence in relation to Section 304B I.P.C. within meaning of Section 222 Cr.P.C., hence, conviction could not be sustained. The appellants have not been held guilty for the offence under Section 498A of the I.P.C. Learned counsel for the appellants has placed reliance upon the judgment of this Court passed in Cr. Appeal No. 78 of 1995 (R) dated 06.07.2001. Therefore, it is prayed that impugned judgment and order of conviction of appellant is absolutely illegal and liable to be set aside and this appeal may be allowed.

Page | 3

11. On the other hand, learned A.P.P. appearing for the State has also fairly admitted that in case of charge under Section 304B of the I.P.C. and without alteration of charges during the trial under Section 306 of the I.P.C. conviction cannot be sustained for the offence under Section 306 of the I.P.C.

12. I have gone through the record of the case and contentions raised on behalf of both side along with impugned judgment and order. It appears that in the instant case, F.I.R. was lodged against the appellants under Sections 498A, 304B and 201 of the I.P.C. for commission of dowry death of the daughter of the informant by alleging additional dowry demand by the appellants and charge- sheet was submitted for the offences under Sections 304B and 498A of the I.P.C. The appellants had faced the trial for the charges under Section 304B/34 and 498A of the I.P.C. It also appears that no materials constituting the offence under Section 304B of the I.PC. was found by the learned trial court. Accordingly, the appellants were held guilty for the offence under Section 306 of the I.P.C. due to unnatural death of the deceased at her matrimonial house.

Learned trial court while convicting the appellant for the offence under Section 306 I.P.C. held in Para 14 as under:-

""The informant is very much consistent about the fact that his daughter was not permitted by the accused to visit her mother at the time when her mother had fracture in her leg and she was very sad because of it. Out of sadness and frustration it appears Page | 4 that she had slapped her small child, as has been deposed by the informant. Refusal of permission by the husband and her mother in law might be immediate cause of taking such a drastic step like to commit suicide""
From above observations and findings of learned trial court, it cannot be said that the appellants have abetted the deceased to commit suicide which is an essential ingredient of the Section 306 I.P.C. There is no iota of evidence that appellants have instigated/abetted the deceased to commit suicide. It is also apparent from the record that entire house of the appellants burnt due to which the deceased sustained burn injuries resulting in her death and appellants were not present in the house.

From the aforesaid discussion, it is quite obvious that the essential ingredient of offence under Section 306 of the I.P.C. is abetment to commit suicide which is absolutely lacking in this case and there was no charge at all for the offence under Section 306 of the I.P.C. It is also quite obvious that both the offences under Sections 304B and 306 of the I.P.C. are mutually exclusive, distinct and different offences having different constituents. Therefore, conviction and sentence of the appellants for the offences under Section 306 of the I.P.C. in the instant case is not warranted under law.

13. In view of the above discussions and reasons, this appeal is Allowed and impugned order of conviction and sentence of appellants is hereby, set aside.


Page | 5

14. Appellants are on bail, they are discharged from the liability of their respective bail bonds and sureties are also be discharged.

15. Pending I.A., if any stands disposed of.

16. Let a copy of this judgment along with trial court record be sent to the concerned court forthwith for information and needful.

                                    ORDER
Dated, this the 06th day of January, 2025 B.S.Joshi and Others v. State of Haryana and another [(2003) 4 SCC 675] held that the offence under Section 498A can be quashed by the High Court exercising its inherent power under Section 482 Cr.P.C (now Section 528 of BNSS, 2023), though such offence is not compoundable under Section 320. Relying on State of Karnataka v. L. Muniswamy [(1977) 2 SCC 699], a two Judges Bench in B.S. Joshi (Supra) held that ends of justice are higher than ends of mere law, though justice has got to be administered according to laws made by legislature. The fact that there is no reasonable likelihood of conviction, in the wake of settlement between the parties, was taken stock of. The following findings in B.S.Joshi (supra) are relevant and extracted here below:

""What would happen to the trial of the case where the wife does not support the imputations made in the FIR of the type in question. As earlier noticed, now she has filed an affidavit that the FIR was registered at her instance due to temperamental differences and implied imputations.
2025:KER:266 There may be many reasons for not supporting the imputations. It may be either for the reason that she has resolved disputes with her husband and his other family members and as a result thereof she has again started living with her husband, with whom she earlier had differences or she has willingly parted company and is living happily on her own or has married someone else on the earlier marriage having been dissolved by divorce on consent of parties or fails to support the prosecution on some other similar grounds. In such eventuality, there would almost be no chance of conviction. Would it then be proper to decline to exercise power of quashing on the ground that it would be permitting the parties to compound non- compoundable offences? The answer clearly has to be in the ""negative"". It would, however, be a different matter if the High Court on facts declines the prayer for quashing for any valid reasons including lack of bona fides.""
2. The dictum laid down in B.S.Joshi (supra) was doubted along with that laid down in other cases and referred to and considered by a three Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303]. B.S.Joshi (supra), along with other cases, were confirmed by the Supreme Court. It is relevant to note that the subject matter in B.S.Joshi (supra) was specifically 2025:KER:266 with reference to the offences under Section 498A and 406 of the Indian Penal Code.


3. In the facts at hand, petitioners are accused 1 to 3 in Crime No.1581/2023 of Kundara Police Station, Kollam, now pending as C.C.No.1587/2023 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kollam. As per the final report, the offence alleged is under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. The petitioners seek quashment of entire proceedings in the above Calendar Case, on the strength of the settlement arrived at by and between the parties.

4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners, learned counsel for the 2nd respondent/defacto complainant and the learned Senior Public Prosecutor. Perused the records.

5. When this Crl.M.C was moved, this Court directed to record the statement of the defacto complainant. The said direction was complied and the statement was handed over. On perusal of the same, it is clear that the issues between the petitioners and the defacto complainant are settled amicably. The instant Crl.M.C. was filed with the knowledge 2025:KER:266 and consent of the defacto complainant and she is not any more interested to prosecute the matter. The defacto complainant has no objection in quashing the criminal proceedings against the petitioners. That apart, it is noticed that along with this Crl.M.C, an affidavit has been sworn to by the defacto complainant (2 nd respondent herein) as Annexure 3, wherein she would unequivocally state that the disputes have been settled out of the Court. The defacto complainant would also swear that she has no grievance against the petitioners and that the affidavit is sworn to on her volition, without any compulsion, whatsoever.

6. In the light of the above referred facts, this Court is of the opinion that the necessary parameters, as culled out in B.S.Joshi (supra) and Gian Singh (Supra), are fully satisfied. This court is convinced that further proceedings against the petitioners will be a futile exercise, inasmuch as the disputes have already been settled. There is little possibility of any conviction in the crime. Dehors the settlement arrived at by and between the parties, if they are compelled to face the criminal proceedings, the same, in 2025:KER:266 the estimation of this Court, will amount to abuse of process of Court. The quashment sought for would secure the ends of justice.

In the circumstances, this Crl.M.C. is allowed. Annexure 2 F.I.R. and F.I.S. in Crime No.1581/2023, Annexure II Final Report and all further proceedings in C.C.No.1587/2023 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kollam are hereby quashed.

               HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE K.SURENDER

               CRIMINAL APPEAL No.191 OF 2016

JUDGMENT:
The present appeal is preferred by the appellant/accused Nos.1 to 3 questioning the conviction under Section 304-B of Indian Penal Code (for short I.P.C) sentencing them to undergo 10 years of imprisonment.

2. Pending the appeal, accused No.2 expired. Accordingly, the appeal stands abated against accused No.2.

3. Briefly, the case of the prosecution is that on 05.11.2011 the appellant/accused No.1 was married to the daughter of PW-1. According to PW-1 at the time of marriage Rs.5,00,000/- cash, gold ornaments worth Rs.1,00,000/- and house-hold articles worth Rs.1,00,000/- were given as dowry.

4. After the marriage the deceased started living with accused Nos.1 to 3 at Karimnagar. They were happy for a period of 15 days, thereafter appellant/accused Nos.1 to 3 started harassing the deceased for bringing additional dowry of Rs.3,00,000/-. The harassment was informed by the deceased to PW-1, then, PW-1 requested accused Nos.1 to 3 not to ill-treat his daughter. However, the harassment continued for additional dowry. On 04.01.2012 accused No.1 took the deceased to the house of PW-1 and dropped her saying that the demand of Rs.3,00,000/- has to be met for continuing to lead conjugal life. On 05.01.2012 at 8:30 A.M. the deceased went into her room, closed the doors and hanged herself with her chunni. PW-1 went to the police station and lodged written complaint which is Ex- P1.

5. The police conducted scene of offence panchanama. Thereafter, inquest proceedings were also completed and the body was sent for postmortem examination.

6. The police concluded investigation and filed charge sheet against accused Nos.1 to 3 for the offences under Section 304-B of I.P.C.

7. The learned Sessions Judge having framed charge for the said offence, examined the witnesses cited by the prosecution who are PWs-1 to 11 and also marked Ex-P1 to P8 documents.

8. The learned Sessions Judge found that the death happened within two months of marriage and there is a specific allegation for demand of additional dowry of Rs.3,00,000/-, accordingly, convicted the appellants sentencing them to undergo imprisonment for a period of 10 years.

9. The learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants submits that the incident took place within two months from the date of marriage and the entire evidence that was brought on record is only hearsay, since the deceased informed PW-1 and PW-3. It appears that the deceased was not interested in the marriage with A.1 and PW-1 and PW-3 forcibly got her married to accused No.1 on the ground that accused No.1 would get a job in police department on compassionate grounds. He further submits that in the cross examination of PW-3 it is stated that one month prior to the marriage, the accused came to them with a marriage proposal, however, it is important to note that father of accused No.1 died on 09.08.2011 and normally marriages will not be performed within one year after the death of the father.

10. Learned Senior counsel further contended that there is no specific allegation against the accused with regard to harassment for additional dowry but vague and omnibus allegations were made. With regard to accused No.3, he is younger brother of accused No.1 and he has nothing to do with the marital life of accused No.1. A.3 had just completed intermediate at the time of incident. According to PW-1, panchayat will be held regarding disputes between husband and wife in their community, but in the present case, no panchayat was held. PW-1 in his cross examination has stated that he knew the father of accused No.1 since 25 years. He further contended that after the registration of the crime, accused No.1 could not get job on compassionate grounds. PW-2 categorically states that police came to the house of PW-1 and PW-3 after fifteen minutes of the incident. But, however, no report was given at that time. The F.I.R. was registered only after PW-1 went to the police station and gave a report to PW-11 at 10:30 A.M. Therefore, there is every possibility of the report being given implicating the accused after due deliberations. Insofar as accused No.1 is concerned, there is no material to attract Section 304-B IPC as the demand of additional dowry was not proved beyond reasonable doubt.

11. The learned Senior counsel relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Durga Prasad v. State of Madhya Pradesh. The Hon'ble Supreme Court while dealing with the situation of dowry death reversed the conviction giving benefit of doubt on the ground that the statements of the victim woman and brother did not disclose regarding cruelty and harassment prior to the death.

12. Reliance is also placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Chabi Karmakar v. The State of West Bengal. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that soon before death, there was no force or compelling reasons for the deceased to commit suicide, in the said circumstances, benefit of doubt was extended.

13. In the case of Chabi Karmakar v. The State of West Bengal, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under:

In paragraph 9 of Rajinder Singh (Supra), this Court had discussed the ingredients of Section 304-B of IPC as follows:
""9. The ingredients of the offence under Section 304-B IPC have been stated and restated in many judgments. There are four such ingredients and they are said to be:
a) death of a woman must have been caused by any burns or bodily injury or her death must have occurred otherwise than under normal circumstances;
b) such death must have occurred within seven years of her marriage;
c) soon before her death, she must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband; and
d) such cruelty or harassment must be in connection with the demand for dowry.""
14. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor would submit that the death occurred within two months of the marriage and presumption arises under Section 113 B of Indian Evidence Act. No married woman would commit suicide within two months unless there was constant harassment meted out by the accused.

15. An unfortunate incident of the deceased committing suicide within two months has happened. The allegation is that there was a demand for Rs.3,00,000/-. Even the evidence of PWs-1, 3 and 4 show that the demand of Rs.3,00,000/- was made. The case is that the deceased was ill-treated by accused Nos.1 to 3. However, what was the ill-treatment that was meted out by the appellant/accused is not specified. Though allegation of ill-treating the deceased for Rs.3,00,000/- and thereafter leaving the deceased in the house of PW-1 on 04.01.2012 is the case of the prosecution, however, neither PW-1 or PW-3 stated about any additional demand of dowry that was made by the accused. The information regarding the additional dowry was through the deceased. However, PW-1, PW-3 and PW-4 stated that they requested the appellant/accused not to harass the deceased.

16. Placing reliance on the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Durga Prasad v. State of Madhya Pradesh and in the case of Chabi Karmakar v. The State of West Bengal, since the allegation of harassment in the present case is vague and omnibus and nothing specific is stated against either husband or the accused No.3 who is the younger brother of the husband, it creates any amount of doubt. Accused No.3 was studying at that relevant time.

17. In view of the general allegations made by PW-1, PW-3 and PW-4, the conviction cannot be maintained insofar as accused No.3 is concerned.

18. Though the alleged harassment pursuant to the demand of Rs.3,00,000/- was made, however, nothing specific is stated by any of the witnesses as already discussed above.

19. The fact remains that there was a demand and the deceased was left at her parents' house. Accordingly, since the prosecution has failed to prove that there was ill-treatment pursuant to the alleged demand, offence under Section 304-B of IPC is not made out. However, accused No.1 is liable under Section 498-A of IPC.

20. Though no separate charge was framed under Section 498-A of IPC, however the charge framed under Section 304-B of IPC reflects that there was harassment for dowry and there was a demand for additional dowry and unable to bear that alleged harassment, the deceased committed suicide. The said charge framed under Section 304-B of IPC reflects cruelty as such no separate charge under Section 498A needs to be framed. Accused No.1 is convicted under Section 498-A of IPC and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for a period of one year. Since accused No.1 is on bail, he shall be summoned by the trial court and on such surrender; the trial court shall send him to prison to serve out the remaining part of the sentence.

21. In view of the above, the instant appeal stands partly allowed.

Miscellaneous applications, if any, pending shall stand dismissed.

Hon'ble Mrs. Manju Rani Chauhan,J.
 
1. Heard Mr. Pushpendra Singh, learned counsel for the applicants as well as Mr. Amit Singh Chauhan, learned A.G.A. for the State and perused the record.

2. The present application has been filed by the applicants to quash the impugned charge sheet dated 16.12.2020 along with Cognizance order dated 16.04.2022 and the entire proceeding of Case No.1169 of 2022 (State vs. Manoj and Others), arising out of Case Crime No.0162 of 2020, under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506, 354A I.P.C. and Section 3/4 D.P. Act, Police Station- Agauta, District- Bulandshahr as well as stay the further proceeding of the aforesaid case, pending in the court of A.C.J. (J.D.)/J.M., Court No.3, Bulandshahr.

3. At the very outset, learned A.G.A. submits that once the charges have already been framed on 09.09.2024, this Court cannot examine the veracity of the said order while exercising the inherent powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

4. A three Judges Bench of Apex Court in Bhawna Bai Vs. Ghanshyam and others, reported in 2020 (2) SCC 217, wherein Court has held as follows in paragraphs:

?15. Considering the scope of Sections 227 and 228 Crl.P.C., in Amit Kapoor v. Ramesh Chander and another (2012) 9 SCC 460, the Supreme Court held as under:-
""17. Framing of a charge is an exercise of jurisdiction by the trial court in terms of Section 228 of the Code, unless the accused is discharged under Section 227 of the Code. Under both these provisions, the court is required to consider the ""record of the case"" and documents submitted therewith and, after hearing the parties, may either discharge the accused or where it appears to the court and in its opinion there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence, it shall frame the charge. Once the facts and ingredients of the section exists, then the court would be right in presuming that there is ground to proceed against the accused and frame the charge accordingly. This presumption is not a presumption of law as such. The satisfaction of the court in relation to the existence of constituents of an offence and the facts leading to that offence is a sine qua non for exercise of such jurisdiction. It may even be weaker than a prima facie case. There is a fine distinction between the language of Sections 227 and 228 of the Code. Section 227 is the expression of a definite opinion and judgment of the Court while Section 228 is tentative. Thus, to say that at the stage of framing of charge, the Court should form an opinion that the accused is certainly guilty of committing an offence, is an approach which is impermissible in terms of Section 228 of the Code. ........?
19. At the initial stage of framing of a charge, the court is concerned not with proof but with a strong suspicion that the accused has committed an offence, which, if put to trial, could prove him guilty. All that the court has to see is that the material on record and the facts would be compatible with the innocence of the accused or not. The final test of guilt is not to be applied at that stage. We may refer to the well-settled law laid down by this Court in State of Bihar v. Ramesh Singh (1977) 4 SCC 39: (SCC pp. 41-42, para 4) ""4. Under Section 226 of the Code while opening the case for the prosecution the Prosecutor has got to describe the charge against the accused and state by what evidence he proposes to prove the guilt of the accused. Thereafter comes at the initial stage the duty of the court to consider the record of the case and the documents submitted therewith and to hear the submissions of the accused and the prosecution in that behalf. The Judge has to pass thereafter an order either under Section 227 or Section 228 of the Code. If ''the Judge considers that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused, he shall discharge the accused and record his reasons for so doing', as enjoined by Section 227. If, on the other hand, ''the Judge is of opinion that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence which -- ... (b) is exclusively triable by the court, he shall frame in writing a charge against the accused', as provided in Section 228. Reading the two provisions together in juxtaposition, as they have got to be, it would be clear that at the beginning and the initial stage of the trial the truth, veracity and effect of the evidence which the Prosecutor proposes to adduce are not to be meticulously judged. Nor is any weight to be attached to the probable defence of the accused. It is not obligatory for the Judge at that stage of the trial to consider in any detail and weigh in a sensitive balance whether the facts, if proved, would be incompatible with the innocence of the accused or not. The standard of test and judgment which is to be finally applied before recording a finding regarding the guilt or otherwise of the accused is not exactly to be applied at the stage of deciding the matter under Section 227 or Section 228 of the Code. At that stage the court is not to see whether there is sufficient ground for conviction of the accused or whether the trial is sure to end in his conviction.
Strong suspicion against the accused, if the matter remains in the region of suspicion, cannot take the place of proof of his guilt at the conclusion of the trial. But at the initial stage if there is a strong suspicion which leads the court to think that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence then it is not open to the court to say that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. The presumption of the guilt of the accused which is to be drawn at the initial stage is not in the sense of the law governing the trial of criminal cases in France where the accused is presumed to be guilty unless the contrary is proved. But it is only for the purpose of deciding prima facie whether the court should proceed with the trial or not. If the evidence which the Prosecutor proposes to adduce to prove the guilt of the accused even if fully accepted before it is challenged in cross-examination or rebutted by the defence evidence, if any, cannot show that the accused committed the offence, then there will be no sufficient ground for proceeding with the trial. An exhaustive list of the circumstances to indicate as to what will lead to one conclusion or the other is neither possible nor advisable. We may just illustrate the difference of the law by one more example. If the scales of pan as to the guilt or innocence of the accused are something like even at the conclusion of the trial, then, on the theory of benefit of doubt the case is to end in his acquittal. But if, on the other hand, it is so at the initial stage of making an order under Section 227 or Section 228, then in such a situation ordinarily and generally the order which will have to be made will be one under Section 228 and not under Section 227.""
16. After referring to Amit Kapoor, in Dinesh Tiwari v. State of Uttar Pradesh and another (2014) 13 SCC 137, the Supreme Court held that for framing charge under Section 228 Crl.P.C., the judge is not required to record detailed reasons as to why such charge is framed. On perusal of record and hearing of parties, if the judge is of the opinion that there is sufficient ground for presuming that the accused has committed the offence triable by the Court of Session, he shall frame the charge against the accused for such offence.?

5. The aforesaid view has also been held in case of Ravindra Pratap Shahi @ Pappu Shahi vs. State of U.P. and Another, reported in 2021 SCC Online ALL 778.

6. Learned counsel for the applicants could not dispute the aforesaid proposition of law.

7. In view of the aforesaid discussion, this Court does not find any error in the order impugned, accordingly the application u/s 482 is dismissed.

8. The Court below is directed to proceed in accordance with law.

(PER : HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE DEVAN M. DESAI)

1. By way of this appeal, the appellant has prayed for quashing and setting aside the judgment and decree dated 1.12.2008 passed by the learned Family Court, NEUTRAL CITATION C/FA/1189/2009 JUDGMENT DATED: 06/01/2025 undefined Ahmedabad vide Exh.53 by which the divorce petition filed under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 being HMP Case No.678 of 2003 was rejected.


2. With consent of the learned advocates for the respective parties, the matter is taken up for final hearing today

3. Heard Mr. Mrudul M. Barot, learned advocate for the appellant and Mr. A. V. Prajapati, learned advocate for the respondent at length. Perused the record.

4. The brief facts of the case are as under:

* On 07/05/1982, the marriage between appellant-original plaintiff and defendant-original respondent took place and out of the wedlock parties have a son named Krunal. For at least a year after the marriage, they lived harmoniously. However, the NEUTRAL CITATION C/FA/1189/2009 JUDGMENT DATED: 06/01/2025 undefined situation changed when the defendant, influenced by her family members, began demanding money from the appellant. When appellant refused, the defendant would instigate quarrels and subject the appellant to mental harassment. Eventually, the defendant deserted appellant's house without any reasonable cause.
* On 17/04/1987, the defendant settled the maintenance case she had previously filed against the appellant and returned to the house of appellant. The defendant had also lodged a complaint under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, against the appellant, which was resolved through a compromise on 26/08/1986. Thereafter, the mother of defendant passed away, and defendant went to her matrimonial home, since then she has neither come to appellant nor performed any of the conjugal rights.
NEUTRAL CITATION C/FA/1189/2009 JUDGMENT DATED: 06/01/2025 undefined * On 14/05/1999, the appellant sent a legal notice to defendant for restitution of conjugal rights which was registered as HMP No. 1682/2000, but the case was later on withdrawn by appellant. On 28/08/2000, the appellant again sent a legal notice to defendant alleging that wife has deserted him without any sufficient reason and asked for restitution of conjugal rights. The defendant has deserted the appellant from 10/07/1998; therefore appellant filed a divorce petition u/s 13 of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 being HMP No. 678 of 2003 before the learned Family Court. The learned Family Court dismissed the divorce petition. Being aggrieved, the appellant - original plaintiff is before this Court.
5. Learned advocate for the appellant submitted that marriage between the appellant and respondent was solemnized on 7.5.1982 as per the custom and out of the said wedlock, a son was born on 15.2.1984. After passing of a year of the marriage, disputes started NEUTRAL CITATION C/FA/1189/2009 JUDGMENT DATED: 06/01/2025 undefined cropping up between the parties and the respondent

- defendant used to unnecessarily quarrel with the appellant - plaintiff by demanding money and if the request of money was not acceded to, respondent used to leave the matrimonial house without any reasonable cause and appellant used to take her back. On 17.04.1987, the respondent filed a criminal case for maintenance and a criminal case was filed against the plaintiff for the offence punishable under Section 498A of IPC. Pursuant to a settlement on 26.8.1986, the matrimonial relations restarted between the appellant and respondent. Upon the death of respondent's mother on 6.4.1998, respondent went to her house. On 10.7.1998, the brother and sisters of the respondent wife came to appellant and demanded money and jewelry of the respondent. Despite rigorous attempts to bring back the respondent - wife back to the matrimonial home, respondent did not return back and resultantly the appellant was constrained to issue a notice dated NEUTRAL CITATION C/FA/1189/2009 JUDGMENT DATED: 06/01/2025 undefined 14.5.1999 calling upon the respondent to resume the marital life. HMP Case No.1682 of 2000 was filed by the appellant against respondent for a relief of restitution of conjugal rights under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act. A settlement was arrived at between the appellant and respondent, resultantantly, said HMP case came to be withdrawn. Thereafter, respondent did not resume marital life with the appellant, hence, another notice dated 28.8.2000 was given to the respondent. It is submitted that without any reasonable cause, respondent has deserted the appellant and without the consent of the appellant left the matrimonial house. The respondent and his family members manhandled the appellant on 14.12.2000 near the gate of Family Court and the appellant was severely beaten up by the relatives of the respondent whereby the appellant had to take treatment in the V.S. Hospital, Ahmedabad. Appellant filed a Criminal Case being No.10 of 2001 before the learned NEUTRAL CITATION C/FA/1189/2009 JUDGMENT DATED: 06/01/2025 undefined Metropolitan Magistrate Court, Ahmedabad against the relatives of the respondent. It is submitted that the respondent has filed her Written Statement vide Exh.6 but did not enter into the witness box and depose in support of her statements made in the Written Statement. It is further submitted in the cross examination of the appellant, nothing adverse could be extracted by respondent. However, the learned trial Court has dismissed the suit on the ground that appellant has not established the allegations of cruelty and desertion. It is submitted that the appellant and respondent are living separately since more than 20 years and there are no chances of reconciliation. The son is also about almost 40 years of age. The attempts for the reunion has failed and looking to the age of the parties, no fruitful purpose would be served if the decree of divorce is not granted.


6. Per contra, learned advocate Mr. Prajapati for NEUTRAL CITATION C/FA/1189/2009 JUDGMENT DATED: 06/01/2025 undefined respondent - wife has submitted that the learned Family Court has rightly considered the evidence on record and there is no illegality committed by the learned Family Court in dismissing the suit. It has been observed by the learned Family Court that appellant - plaintiff has failed to establish the allegation of cruelty alleged to have been inflicted upon by the wife. It is further submitted that in the proceedings of maintenance, the learned Court has passed an order of Rs.4,000/- per month as maintenance in favour of the wife. The learned trial Court has also observed that settlement was made by the appellant just to see that he has not to face the criminal trial for the offence punishable u/S.498A of the IPC and it has been also observed by the learned Family Court that the appellant has failed to establish that the respondent has deserted him without any reasonable cause. It is submitted that when the learned Family Court has assessed the evidence, this Court may not re-appreciate the NEUTRAL CITATION C/FA/1189/2009 JUDGMENT DATED: 06/01/2025 undefined evidence and may not interfere in the finding of fact.

7. We have heard the learned advocates for the parties at length and also perused the impugned judgment and decree together with Record & Proceedings of the suit. The undisputed facts which emerge from the record is that the marriage between the parties was solemnized on 7.5.1982 and a son named; Krunal is born out of the wedlock on 15.2.1984. Appellant and respondent are staying separately since the year 2000 and learned Family Court has observed in its judgment that during the process of conciliation, appellant and respondent were not ready for talks and also did not see each other's face.

8. The appellant has deposed at Exh.26 and has reiterated the allegations which are made in the plaint in his affidavit in lieu of examination in chief. If cross examination of the appellant is perused, it is found that the respondent has not put any questions NEUTRAL CITATION C/FA/1189/2009 JUDGMENT DATED: 06/01/2025 undefined on the allegation of desertion. Respondent has not controverted the appellant on the allegation of cruelty. Moreover, it is worthwhile to observe that vide Exh.40 (Page No.238 of R & P), the wife has declared by a Purshis that she does not want to lead any written or oral evidence against the application of the plaintiff for a relief of divorce. Thus, it transpires that respondent - wife has chosen not to enter in the witness box and has not controverted any of the allegations of the plaintiff - husband. In the background of the above undisputed fact, it would be apposite to refer the decision of Vidhyadhar v. Manik Rao reported in 1999(3) SCC 573. The relevant portion of the said decision is reproduced hereunder:


""Where a party to the suit does not appear in the witness-box and states his own case on oath and does not offer himself to be cross-examined by the other side, a presumption would arise that the case set up by him is not correct.""
NEUTRAL CITATION C/FA/1189/2009 JUDGMENT DATED: 06/01/2025 undefined

9. When the party has not offered herself to be cross examined by the other party, a presumption can be drawn that the allegations and contentions raised by party has been accepted, has also accepted the case of the other party. In the present case, when the plaintiff has specifically alleged cruelty and desertion in the examination in chief, in absence of any challenge and contrary material shown by the respondent, we are of the opinion that the learned Family Court has committed an error of interpreting the evidence and further committed an error by dismissing the suit. The interference in the finding of the learned Family Court is required on two aspects; firstly, the defendant wife has kept herself away from contradicting the allegations made by the plaintiff against her and further kept herself away from leading any oral evidence. Secondly, looking to the period of separation which is more than 20 years and both the parties are in their early age of 60s, we are of the opinion that the marriage between the parties NEUTRAL CITATION C/FA/1189/2009 JUDGMENT DATED: 06/01/2025 undefined has been irretrievably broken down and we do not see any reason or cause for reconciliation.

10. It would be in the fitness of the things to refer the decision of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Rishikesh Sharma v. Saroj Sharma (2007) 2 SCC 263, (2006) 12 Scale 282, wherein, the Court observed that the respondent wife was living separately from the year 1981 and the marriage had broken down irretrievably with no possibility of the parties living together again. The Court further observed that it will not be possible for the parties to live together and therefore there was no purpose in compelling both the parties to live together. Therefore the best course was to dissolve the marriage by passing a decree of divorce so that the parties who were litigating since 1981 and had lost valuable part of life could live peacefully in remaining part of their life. The Court further observed that her desire to live with her husband at that stage and at NEUTRAL CITATION C/FA/1189/2009 JUDGMENT DATED: 06/01/2025 undefined that instance of time was not genuine.

11. When the parties have crossed their major portion of life in prosecuting litigations, we feel sorry about the bitter relationship between the parties. Even the son which is born out of the wedlock, is almost 40 years of age and as per the submissions of the learned advocates for the parties, the son is also having his family. We are unequivocally of the view that nothing really subsists in the marriage except mutual accrimony. In this peculiar set of circumstances, we are of the opinion that the appeal deserves to be allowed.


12. In view of above, the appeal is allowed. The judgment and decree passed by the learned Family Court, Ahmedabad vide Exh.53 in HMP Case No.678 of 2003 is hereby quashed and set aside. HMP Case No.678 of 2003 is allowed. Decree be drawn accordingly.

NEUTRAL CITATION C/FA/1189/2009 JUDGMENT DATED: 06/01/2025 undefined

13. Record & Proceedings, if any, be sent back to the concerned Court. No order as to costs.

14. Connected Civil Applications stand disposed of as they would not survive.

Mritunjay Tiwari And 6 Others vs State Of U.P. And Another on 6 January, 2025
1. Heard Mr. Anand Pal Singh, learned counsel for the applicants, Mr. Sanjay Kumar Mishra, learned counsel for the opposite party no.2 as well as Mr. Amit Singh Chauhan, learned A.G.A. for the State and perused the record.

2. The present application has been filed by the applicants to quash the order dated 18.09.2024 passed by Additional Session Judge, F.T.C.-II, Kushinagar at Padrauna rejecting the discharge application moved by the applicants dated 26.09.2023 and in continuation passed the another order on 24.09.2024 framing the charge against the applicants under Sections 498A, 304B, 201 (Alternative under Section 302) I.P.C. and Section 3/4 D.P. Act, in S.T. No.958 of 2023, arising out of Case Crime No.1203/2016 (State vs. Mritunjay Tiwari and Others), Police Station- Kotwali Padrauna, District- Kushinagar, pending before the court of Additional Session Judge, F.T.C.-II, Kushinagar at Padrauna.

3. At the very outset, learned A.G.A. as well as learned counsel for the opposite party no.2 points out that earlier the applicants had approached this Court with a prayer to quash the charge sheet and the entire proceedings by means of filing Application U/S 482 No.13307 of 2020 and the aforesaid case has been dismissed by a detailed order on merits passed by Co-ordinate Bench of this Court on 11.09.2024 after which the discharge application has been rejected on 18.09.2024 and the charges have been framed on 24.09.2024, therefore, this Court cannot examine the veracity of the said order while exercising the inherent powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

4. A three Judges Bench of Apex Court in Bhawna Bai Vs. Ghanshyam and others, reported in 2020 (2) SCC 217, wherein Court has held as follows in paragraphs:

""15. Considering the scope of Sections 227 and 228 Crl.P.C., in Amit Kapoor v. Ramesh Chander and another (2012) 9 SCC 460, the Supreme Court held as under:-
""17. Framing of a charge is an exercise of jurisdiction by the trial court in terms of Section 228 of the Code, unless the accused is discharged under Section 227 of the Code. Under both these provisions, the court is required to consider the ""record of the case"" and documents submitted therewith and, after hearing the parties, may either discharge the accused or where it appears to the court and in its opinion there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence, it shall frame the charge. Once the facts and ingredients of the section exists, then the court would be right in presuming that there is ground to proceed against the accused and frame the charge accordingly. This presumption is not a presumption of law as such. The satisfaction of the court in relation to the existence of constituents of an offence and the facts leading to that offence is a sine qua non for exercise of such jurisdiction. It may even be weaker than a prima facie case. There is a fine distinction between the language of Sections 227 and 228 of the Code. Section 227 is the expression of a definite opinion and judgment of the Court while Section 228 is tentative. Thus, to say that at the stage of framing of charge, the Court should form an opinion that the accused is certainly guilty of committing an offence, is an approach which is impermissible in terms of Section 228 of the Code. ........?
19. At the initial stage of framing of a charge, the court is concerned not with proof but with a strong suspicion that the accused has committed an offence, which, if put to trial, could prove him guilty. All that the court has to see is that the material on record and the facts would be compatible with the innocence of the accused or not. The final test of guilt is not to be applied at that stage. We may refer to the well-settled law laid down by this Court in State of Bihar v. Ramesh Singh (1977) 4 SCC 39: (SCC pp. 41-42, para 4) ""4. Under Section 226 of the Code while opening the case for the prosecution the Prosecutor has got to describe the charge against the accused and state by what evidence he proposes to prove the guilt of the accused. Thereafter comes at the initial stage the duty of the court to consider the record of the case and the documents submitted therewith and to hear the submissions of the accused and the prosecution in that behalf. The Judge has to pass thereafter an order either under Section 227 or Section 228 of the Code. If ''the Judge considers that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused, he shall discharge the accused and record his reasons for so doing', as enjoined by Section 227. If, on the other hand, ''the Judge is of opinion that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence which -- ... (b) is exclusively triable by the court, he shall frame in writing a charge against the accused', as provided in Section 228. Reading the two provisions together in juxtaposition, as they have got to be, it would be clear that at the beginning and the initial stage of the trial the truth, veracity and effect of the evidence which the Prosecutor proposes to adduce are not to be meticulously judged. Nor is any weight to be attached to the probable defence of the accused. It is not obligatory for the Judge at that stage of the trial to consider in any detail and weigh in a sensitive balance whether the facts, if proved, would be incompatible with the innocence of the accused or not. The standard of test and judgment which is to be finally applied before recording a finding regarding the guilt or otherwise of the accused is not exactly to be applied at the stage of deciding the matter under Section 227 or Section 228 of the Code. At that stage the court is not to see whether there is sufficient ground for conviction of the accused or whether the trial is sure to end in his conviction.
Strong suspicion against the accused, if the matter remains in the region of suspicion, cannot take the place of proof of his guilt at the conclusion of the trial. But at the initial stage if there is a strong suspicion which leads the court to think that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence then it is not open to the court to say that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. The presumption of the guilt of the accused which is to be drawn at the initial stage is not in the sense of the law governing the trial of criminal cases in France where the accused is presumed to be guilty unless the contrary is proved. But it is only for the purpose of deciding prima facie whether the court should proceed with the trial or not. If the evidence which the Prosecutor proposes to adduce to prove the guilt of the accused even if fully accepted before it is challenged in cross-examination or rebutted by the defence evidence, if any, cannot show that the accused committed the offence, then there will be no sufficient ground for proceeding with the trial. An exhaustive list of the circumstances to indicate as to what will lead to one conclusion or the other is neither possible nor advisable. We may just illustrate the difference of the law by one more example. If the scales of pan as to the guilt or innocence of the accused are something like even at the conclusion of the trial, then, on the theory of benefit of doubt the case is to end in his acquittal. But if, on the other hand, it is so at the initial stage of making an order under Section 227 or Section 228, then in such a situation ordinarily and generally the order which will have to be made will be one under Section 228 and not under Section 227.""
16. After referring to Amit Kapoor, in Dinesh Tiwari v. State of Uttar Pradesh and another (2014) 13 SCC 137, the Supreme Court held that for framing charge under Section 228 Crl.P.C., the judge is not required to record detailed reasons as to why such charge is framed. On perusal of record and hearing of parties, if the judge is of the opinion that there is sufficient ground for presuming that the accused has committed the offence triable by the Court of Session, he shall frame the charge against the accused for such offence.""

5. The aforesaid view has also been held in case of Ravindra Pratap Shahi @ Pappu Shahi vs. State of U.P. and Another, reported in 2021 SCC Online ALL 778.

6. Learned counsel for the applicants could not dispute the aforesaid proposition of law.

7. In view of the aforesaid discussion, this Court does not find any error in the order impugned, accordingly the application u/s 482 is dismissed.

8. The Court below is directed to proceed in accordance with law.

Noushad vs State Of Kerala on 6 January, 2025
Dated, this the 06th day of January, 2025 B.S.Joshi and Others v. State of Haryana and another [(2003) 4 SCC 675] held that the offence under Section 498A can be quashed by the High Court exercising its inherent power under Section 482 Cr.P.C (now Section 528 of BNSS, 2023), though such offence is not compoundable under Section 320. Relying on State of Karnataka v. L. Muniswamy [(1977) 2 SCC 699], a two Judges Bench in B.S. Joshi (Supra) held that ends of justice are higher than ends of mere law, though justice has got to be administered according to laws made by legislature. The fact that there is no reasonable likelihood of conviction, in the wake of settlement between the parties, was taken stock of. The following findings in B.S.Joshi (supra) are relevant and extracted here below:

""What would happen to the trial of the case where the wife does not support the imputations made in the FIR of the type in question. As earlier noticed, now she has filed an affidavit that the 2025:KER:216 FIR was registered at her instance due to temperamental differences and implied imputations. There may be many reasons for not supporting the imputations. It may be either for the reason that she has resolved disputes with her husband and his other family members and as a result thereof she has again started living with her husband, with whom she earlier had differences or she has willingly parted company and is living happily on her own or has married someone else on the earlier marriage having been dissolved by divorce on consent of parties or fails to support the prosecution on some other similar grounds. In such eventuality, there would almost be no chance of conviction. Would it then be proper to decline to exercise power of quashing on the ground that it would be permitting the parties to compound non- compoundable offences? The answer clearly has to be in the ""negative"". It would, however, be a different matter if the High Court on facts declines the prayer for quashing for any valid reasons including lack of bona fides.""
2. The dictum laid down in B.S.Joshi (supra) was doubted along with that laid down in other cases and referred to and considered by a three Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303]. B.S.Joshi (supra), along with other cases, were 2025:KER:216 confirmed by the Supreme Court. It is relevant to note that the subject matter in B.S.Joshi (supra) was specifically with reference to the offences under Section 498A and 406 of the Indian Penal Code.


3. In the facts at hand, petitioners are accused 1 to 3 in Crime No.514/2022 of Kolathur Police Station, Malappuram, now pending as C.C.No.813/2022 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Perinthalmanna. As per the final report, the offences alleged are under Sections 406, 498A and 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The petitioners seek quashment of entire proceedings in the above Calendar Case, on the strength of the settlement arrived at by and between the parties.


4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners, learned counsel for the 3rd respondent/defacto complainant and the learned Senior Public Prosecutor. Perused the records.

5. When this Crl.M.C was moved, this Court directed to record the statement of the defacto complainant. The said direction was complied and the statement was handed over. On 2025:KER:216 perusal of the same, it is clear that the issues between the petitioners and the defacto complainant are settled amicably. The defacto complainant and the 1 st petitioner have dissolved their marriage and both have re-married subsequently. The defacto complainant has no objection in quashing the criminal proceedings against the petitioners. That apart, it is noticed that along with this Crl.M.C, an affidavit has been sworn to by the defacto complainant (3 rd respondent herein) as Annexure 3, wherein she would unequivocally state that the disputes have been settled out of the Court. She would also state that pursuant to divorce, she received the entire amount as per the dissolution agreement. The defacto complainant would also swear that she has no grievance against the petitioners and that the affidavit is sworn to on her volition, without any compulsion, whatsoever.


6. In the light of the above referred facts, this Court is of the opinion that the necessary parameters, as culled out in B.S.Joshi (supra) and Gian Singh (Supra), are fully satisfied. This Court is convinced that further proceedings 2025:KER:216 against the petitioners will be a futile exercise, inasmuch as the disputes have already been settled. There is little possibility of any conviction in the crime. Dehors the settlement arrived at by and between the parties, if they are compelled to face the criminal proceedings, the same, in the estimation of this Court, will amount to abuse of process of Court. The quashment sought for would secure the ends of justice.

In the circumstances, this Crl.M.C. is allowed. Annexure 1 FIR in Crime No.514/2022, Annexure 2 Final Report and all further proceedings in C.C.No.813/2022 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Perinthalmanna, are hereby quashed.

N. Jagadeeswaran vs The Inspector Of Police on 6 February, 2020
This Criminal Original Petition has been filed to quash the proceedings in S.C.No.102 of 2018 on the file of the Mahila Court at Trichy.

http://www.judis.nic.in

2. The case of the prosecution is that the third daughter of the defacto complainant one petitioner Nithya was married to the accused on 18.01.2016 at Akilandeeswari Temple Mandapam as per hindu rites and customs. At the time of marriage three sovereigns of jewels were given to Nithya and half sovereign of ring was given to the first accused. Apart from that sreedhana articles two wheeler were given. After the marriage the victim Nithya was living with her in-laws in her husband's house as joint family. Six months after marriage the first accused/husband had left to Singapore and that the first accused/ husband used to send money to the petitioner/ fourth accused who is his friend and he used to hand over the money to the family. Further allegation is that the in-laws had committed cruelty on the victim. Further the second accused mother-in-law had objected her in attending a marriage resulting in her committing suicide on 22.01.2017. Therefore the First Information Report has been registered and the respondent police after completion of investigation filed the final report for the offence under Sections 306 and 498(A)of IPC and the case had been taken up in S.C.No.102 of 2018.

http://www.judis.nic.in

3.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would submit that the petitioner is arrayed as A4 in S.C.No.102 of 2018 on the file of the Mahila Court Trichy. He would also submit that the petitioner being friend of A1 does not fall within the category of “relative “ of the husband and further there is absolutely no allegation against the petitioner that he either committed cruelty of abetted the victim to commit suicide. He would submit that this Court finding that there is absolutely no material against the petitioner had stayed all further proceedings in respect of the petitioner alone. Thereafter PW.1 to PW. 10 have been examined before the trial Court. Even in their deposition nothing had been stated about the petitioner. There is absolutely no direct of indirect evidence against the petitioner and thereby the entire proceedings is an abuse of process of law.

4. In support of his contention he relied on the judgement of the Honourable Apex Court in the case of U.Suvetha -Vs- The Inspector of Another, reported in CDJ 2009 SC 996 wherein it is held as follows:

“9. Ingredients of 498A of the Indian Penal Code are :-
a). The woman must be married
b) She must be subjected to cruelty or harassment;
and http://www.judis.nic.in

c) Such cruelty or harassment must have been show neither by husband of the woman or by the relative of her husband.""

10. Appellant herein had not been charged for abetment of a crime. Any conspiracy amongst the accused persons has also not been alleged. A woman in terms of the aforementioned provision must be subjected to cruelty by her husband and/or his relative. The word `cruelty' has also been defined in the explanation appended thereto. It is in two parts. Clause (a) of the said explanation refers to a conduct which is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to her life, limb or health (whether mental or physical); clause (b) provides for harassment of the woman, where such harassment, is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security.It is not the case of the first informant that the appellant had any role to play with regard to demand of dowry.

11. The word `cruelty"" having been defined in terms of the aforesaid explanation, no other meaning can be attributed thereto. Living with another woman may be an act of cruelty on the part of the husband for the purpose of judicial separation or dissolution of marriage but the same, in our opinion, would not attract the wrath of Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

An offence in terms of the said provision is committed by the persons specified therein. They have to be the `husband' or his `relative"". Either the husband of the woman or his relative must be subjected to her to cruelty within the aforementioned provision.

If the appellant had not been instigating the husband of the first informant to torture her, as has been noticed by the High Court, the husband would be committing some offence punishable under the other provisions of the Indian Penal Code and appellant may be held guilty for abetment of commission of such an offence but not an offence under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

12. In the absence of any statutory definition, the term `relative' must be assigned a meaning as is commonly understood. Ordinarily it would include father, mother, husband or wife, son, daughter, brother, sister, nephew or niece, grandson or grand-daughter of an individual or the spouse of any person. The meaning of the word `relative' would depend upon the nature of the statute. It principally includes a person related by blood, marriage or adoption.

The word `relative' has been defined in P. Ramanatha Aiyar Advanced Law Lexicon - Volume 4, 3rd Edition as under :-

http://www.judis.nic.in ""Relative, ""RELATIVE"" includes any person related by blood, marriage or adoption. [Lunacy Act ].The expression ""REALTIVE"" means a husband wife, ancestor, lineal descendant, brother or sister. [Estate Duty Act].""RELATIVE"" means in relation to the deceased,
a) the wife or husband of the deceased;

5. He further relied on the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Vijeta Gajra -Vs- State of NCT of Delhi, reported in CDJ 2010 SC 564 wherein it is held as follows:

“7. Shri U.U. Lalit, Learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the appellant argued that in U. Suvetha v. State By Inspector of Police & Anr. [(2009) 6 SCC 757], it was specifically held that in order to be covered under Section 498A, IPC one has to be a `relative' of the husband by blood, marriage or adoption. He pointed out that the present appellant was not in any manner a `relative' as referred to in Section 498A, IPC and, therefore, there is no question of any allegation against her in respect of the ill- treatment of the complainant. The Court in this case examined the ingredients of Section 498A, IPC and noting the specific language of the Section and the Explanation thereof came to the conclusion that the word `relative' would not include a paramour or concubine or so. Relying on the dictionary meaning of the word `relative' and further relying on R. Ramanatha Aiyar's Advance Law Lexicon, Volume 4, 3rd Edition, the Court went on to hold that Section 498A, IPC being a penal provision would deserve strict construction and unless a contextual meaning is required to be given to the statute, the said statute has to be construed strictly. On that behalf the Court relied on the judgment in T. Ashok Pai v. CIT [(2007) 7 SCC 162]. A reference was made to the decision in Shivcharan Lal Verma & Anr. v. State of M.P. [(2007) 15 SCC 369]. After quoting from various decisions of this Court, it was held that reference to the word `relative' in Section 498A, IPC would be limited only to the blood relations or the relations by marriage.
8. Relying heavily on this, Shri Lalit contended that there is no question of any trial of the appellant for the offence under Section 498A, IPC. The argument is undoubtedly correct, though opposed by the Learned Counsel appearing for the State. We are of the opinion that there will be no question of her prosecution under Section 498A, IPC. Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the complainant, Shri Soli J. Sorabjee, also did not seriously dispute this proposition. Therefore, we hold that the FIR insofar as it concerned Section 498A, IPC, would be of no consequence and the appellant shall not be tried for the offence under Section 498A, IPC.
6. This Court directed the second respondent/ defacto complainant to be present before the Court and the second respondent http://www.judis.nic.in also present before the Court. This Court enquired the defacto complainant and he submitted that he has no grievance against the petitioner and that neither himself nor his relative have deposed anything against the petitioner.


7. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor would submit that sofar 10 witnesses have been examined and none of the witnesses have spoken anything either directly or indirectly about the involvement of the petitioner. He would also submit that they have not deposed anything against the petitioner before the trial Court and there is no other material available against the petitioner for implicating him. He would also submit that due to the pendency of this quash petition the trial court is unable to proceed with the trial against the other accused. Hence, he would pray that a direction may be issued to the trial court to complete the proceedings in respect of other accused as expeditiously as possible.


8. This Court is of the opinion that no useful purpose will be served in keeping the proceedings pending against the petitioner. http://www.judis.nic.in

9. Accordingly, this Criminal Original Petition stands allowed and as a sequel, the proceedings in S.C.No.102 of 2018 on the file of the Mahila Court at Trichy , is quashed insofar as the petitioner alone. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petition is also closed. Further the trial court is directed to complete the trial proceedings in respect of other accused persons within a period of four months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.

Jayakumar S vs State Of Kerala on 6 January, 2025
Dated, this the 6th day of January, 2025 B.S.Joshi and Others v. State of Haryana and another [(2003) 4 SCC 675] held that the offence under Section 498 A can be quashed by the High Court exercising its inherent power under Section 482 Cr.P.C (now Section 528 of B.N.S.S, 2023), though such offence is not compoundable under Section 320. Relying on State of Karnataka v. L. Muniswamy [(1977) 2 SCC 699], a two Judges Bench in B.S.Joshi (supra) held that ends of justice are higher than ends of mere law, though justice has got to be administered according to laws made by legislature. The fact that there is no reasonable likelihood of conviction, in the wake of settlement between the parties, was taken stock of. The following findings in B.S.Joshi (supra) are relevant and extracted here below:

""What would happen to the trial of the case where the wife does not support the imputations made in the FIR of the type in question. As earlier noticed, now she has filed an affidavit that the FIR was registered at her instance due to temperamental differences and implied imputations. There may be many reasons for not supporting the imputations. It
-: 2 :-
2025:KER:422 may be either for the reason that she has resolved disputes with her husband and his other family members and as a result thereof she has again started living with her husband, with whom she earlier had differences or she has willingly parted company and is living happily on her own or has married someone else on the earlier marriage having been dissolved by divorce on consent of parties or fails to support the prosecution on some other similar grounds. In such eventuality, there would almost be no chance of conviction. Would it then be proper to decline to exercise power of quashing on the ground that it would be permitting the parties to compound non-compoundable offences? The answer clearly has to be in the ""negative"". It would, however, be a different matter if the High Court on facts declines the prayer for quashing for any valid reasons including lack of bona fides.""
2. The dictum laid down in B.S.Joshi (supra) was doubted along with that laid down in other cases and referred to and considered by a three Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303]. B.S.Joshi (supra), along with other cases, were confirmed by the Supreme Court. It is relevant to note that the subject matter in B.S.Joshi (supra) was specifically with

2025:KER:422 reference to the offences under Section 498A and 406 of the Indian Penal Code.
3. In the facts at hand, petitioners are accused nos.1 to 4 in crime no.1282/2023 of Njarakkal Police Station, Ernakulam, now pending as C.C.No.566/2024 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Njarakkal. As per the Final Report the offences alleged is under Section 498 A of the Indian Penal Code. The petitioners seek quashment of entire proceedings in the above Calendar Case, on the strength of the settlement arrived at by and between the parties.

4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners; learned counsel for the 2nd respondent/defacto complainant and the learned Senior Public Prosecutor. Perused the records.

5. When this Crl.M.C was moved, this Court directed to record the statement of the defacto complainant. The said direction was complied and the statement was handed over. On perusal of the same, it is clear that the issues between the petitioners

2025:KER:422 and the defacto complainant are settled, pursuant to which divorce on mutual consent is sought before the Family Court, North Paravur. The defacto complainant has no objection in quashing the criminal proceedings against the petitioners. That apart, it is noticed that, along with this Crl.M.C, an affidavit has been sworn to by the defacto complainant (2nd respondent herein) as Annexure-A4, wherein she would unequivocally state that the disputes have been settled. The defacto complainant would also swear that she has no surviving grievance against the petitioners and that the affidavit is sworn to on her own volition, without any compulsion, whatsoever. Moreover, this Court has also perused Annexure-A3 agreement between the 1st petitioner and the 2nd respondent/defacto complainant in O.P.Nos.375/2024 and 1750/2023 before the Family Court, North Paravur, which also speaks about the settlement between the parties. This Court is therefore convinced that the settlement arrived at is genuine and bonafide. Learned counsel for the 2 nd respondent/defacto complainant would also endorse that the quashment sought for can be allowed.

6. In the light of the above referred facts, this Court                         is

of the opinion that the necessary parameters, as culled out in B.S.Joshi (supra) and Gian Singh (supra), are fully satisfied. This court is convinced that further proceedings against the petitioners will be a futile exercise, inasmuch as the disputes have already been settled. There is little possibility of any conviction in the crime. Dehors the settlement arrived at by and between the parties, if they are compelled to face the criminal proceedings, the same, in the estimation of this Court, will amount to abuse of process of Court. The quashment sought for would secure the ends of justice.
7. In the circumstances, this Crl.M.C. is allowed.
Annexure-A2 Final Report and all further proceedings in C.C. No.566/2024 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Njarakkal are hereby quashed.

K.Ramesh vs State Represented By on 5 July, 2019
1. This Criminal Appeal is filed by the Appellant/ A1, against the judgement of conviction and sentence, dated 10.09.2009, made in SC.No.9 of 2008, by the Mahila Court, Chengalpattu, finding the Appellant/A1 guilty for the offence under Section 498A and convicting and sentencing him to undergo two years Rigorous Imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/-, in default to undergo Simple Imprisonment for a period of six months and acquitting the Appellant/A1 for the offence under Sections 304B and 306 of IPC and acquitting A2 for the offences under Sections 304B, 306 and 498A of IPC http://www.judis.nic.in

2. The brief facts of the Prosecution are as follows:-

a) The Deputy Superintendent of Police, Kancheepuram District had filed a final report, against the Appellant/A1 and one Parameshwari/A2, for the offences under Sections 304B, 306 and 498A of IPC, alleging that the marriage between the Appellant/A1 and the deceased Dhanalakshmi, took place on 24.05.2007 and at the time of marriage, as against the demand of 15 sovereigns of jewels and a motorcycle made by the family of the Appellant/A1, 10 sovereigns of jewels and Rs.28,000/- worth of household articles were given to the Appellant/A1. After 10 days of marriage, during post marriage ceremony (jhyp gphpj;J nfhh;f;Fk; tpHh) Rs.10,000/- worth of golden beads were given to the Appellant/A1. After the marriage, deceased Dhanalakshmi was living in a joint family along with the Appellant/A1 in the North Mada Lane, Govindavadhi Agaram and till the post marriage ceremoney (jhyp gphpj;J nfhh;f;Fk; tpHh), the Appellant/A1 and the deceased were living happily together. Thereafter, within one month Appellant/A1 is stated to have harassed the deceased, by demanding the balance jewels and motorcycle.
b) It is further alleged in the final report that the Appellant/A1 was having illicit intimacy with one Parameshwari/A2, which was questioned by the deceased, stating that the Appellant/A1 should not go to the house of A2 and should not bring the children of A2 to their house. Four days prior to the occurrence, the Appellant/A1 and A2-Parameshwari had assaulted the deceased and again on 25.06.2007, Appellant/A1 had brought the http://www.judis.nic.in children of A2 and had given food to them, which act was questioned and warned by the deceased. Again on 26.06.2007, at about 8.30.a.m., the deceased saw the Appellant/A1 and A2 talking with each other near Throuwbadhi Amman Temple and that the deceased asked her husband/A1 to come to the house immediately by pulling his hands and saying that if he would not come to the residence, she would commit suicide by hanging, to which, the Appellant/A1 had told her to do so in a lethargic manner. Unable to bear the illicit relationship of her husband with A2 and harassment by demanding dowry and due to mental agony, the deceased committed suicide by hanging.
3. The final report was filed before the learned Judicial Magistrate-II, Kancheepuram and the learned Magistrate, finding that the case was exclusively triable by the Court of Sessions, had forwarded the case to the learned Principal District and Sessions Judge, Chengalpattu. The learned Principal District and Sessions Judge, Chengalpattu, made over to the Mahila Court, Chengalpattu.

4. The case was taken on file in SC.No.9 of 2008, by the Mahila Court, Chengalpattu and necessary charges were framed. The accused had denied the charges and sought for trial. In order to bring home the charges against the accused, the prosecution examined PW.1 to PW.12 and also marked Exs.P1 to P11 and marked Mos.1 and 2. No evidence was let in on the side of the defence.

5. On completion of the evidence on the side of the prosecution, the Appellant/A1 was questioned under Section 313 Cr.PC as to the http://www.judis.nic.in incriminating circumstances found in the evidence of prosecution witnesses and the Appellant/A1 has come with the version of total denial and stated that he has been falsely implicated in this case.

6. The court below, after hearing the arguments advanced on either side and also looking into the materials available on record, while acquitting the Appellant/A1 for the offences under Sections 304B and 306 of IPC, found the Appellant/A1 guilty for the offence under Section 498A of IPC and awarded punishments, as referred to above, which is challenged in this Criminal Appeal, by the Appellant/A1. In and by the impugned judgement, A2 was acquitted for the offences under Sections 304B, 306 and 498A of IPC.

7. This court heard the learned counsel on either side.

8. The learned counsel for the appellant has assailed the impugned judgement of conviction and sentence on the following grounds:-

a) The Trial Court, having found the Appellant/A1 not guilty for the offences under Sections 304B and 306 of IPC, ought not have convicted the Appellant/A1 for the offence under Section 498A of IPC on the same set of facts and evidence.
b) The prosecution has failed to prove the charges against the Appellant/A1 for the offence under Section 498A of IPC, by letting in evidence to satisfy the ingredients of Section 498A. The Trial Court had convicted the Appellant/A1 on presumptions, when no legal evidence has been let in by the prosecution to prove that there was an illicit affair between the Appellant/A1 and A-2. Admittedly, even as per the evidence, there was false notion and suspicion by the deceased with regard to the relation http://www.judis.nic.in ship between the Appellant/A1 and A2. Though according to the Prosecution, the deceased was aggrieved over the Appellant/A1, feeding the children of A2, but no evidence was let in by the prosecution in this regard.
c) No legal evidence had been let in by the prosecution to prove that there was an illicit relationship between the Appellant/A1 and A2 and that the deceased committed suicide due to such illicit relationship.
d) The independent witnesses have not supported the case of Prosecution.
PW.4 - Ramu, who has been examined from the Village has also not supported the case of the prosecution.

e) Though, the incident had happened within one month after marriage, it is the admitted case that there was no demand of dowry. Further, the evidence of P.W.4 is categoric that they were living happily even few days prior to the occurrence. The evidence of P.Ws.2 and 3 cannot be believed, as it is nothing but exaggeration and none of the villagers have supported the case of the prosecution.

9. In support of his contentions, the learned counsel for the Appellant/A1 would rely on the judgements of the Hon'ble Apex Court reported in (2015) 11 SCC 753 (Ghusabhai Raisangbhai Chorasiya and others Vs. State of Gujarat) and 2017 11 SCC 176 (K.V.Prakash Babu Vs. State of Karnataka),, wherein, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, relying on its earlier Judgements has acquitted the Appellant/A1, finding that the Prosecution has not proved the ingredients of Section 498A.

10.Per contra, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the Respondent http://www.judis.nic.in would submit that P.W.1-Father, P.W.2-Brother, P.W.3- Friend of P.W.2 have spoken about the victim, being subjected to cruelty by the Appellant/A1 and that the Prosecution has proved its case, by adducing clear and cogent evidence and that considering the evidence, both oral and documentary, in a proper perspective, the Trial Court had, rightly convicted and sentenced the Appellant/accused, by the impugned judgement, which warrants no interference by this Court. He would rely on the recent judgement of the Honourable Supreme Court reported in (2018) 9 SCC 621 (Siddaling Vs. State, Through Kalagi Police Station).

11.I have given my careful and anxious consideration to the rival contentions put forward by either side and thoroughly scanned through the entire evidence available on record and also perused the impugned judgement of conviction.

12.In this case, there are two accused, namely, the Appellant/A1 and one Parameshwari/A2. The charges against both the accused are under Sections 304B, 306 and 498A of IPC. The second accused was acquitted of all the charges levelled against her. The Trial Court, while acquitting the Appellant/A1 for the offences under Sections 304B of 306 of IPC, had convicted and sentenced the Appellant/A1 only for the offence under Section 498A of IPC.

13.Now, the point that arises consideration is as to whether the Trial Court was right in convicting the Appellant/ A1 for the offence under section 498A IPC, on the same set of facts and evidence, while acquitting him for the offences under Sections 304B and 306 of IPC, relying on the same evidence. http://www.judis.nic.in

14.Though an acquittal under Sections 304B and 306 of IPC itself is not a ground for acquittal under section 498A IPC, there must be a cogent material and evidence in the case of the Prosecution to bring home the guilt of the accused for the offence under section 498A of IPC. The evidence of the witnesses on the side of the Prosecution runs as under.

15.PW.1-Gopal, who is the father of the deceased had deposed that the Appellant/A1 is his son in law and A2 is Aunt of A1 and that his daughter Dhanalakshmi was married to A1 and that at the time of marriage, they had given jewels and that 28 days after the marriage, he had received a phone call, informing that the Appellant/A1 had beaten her daughter and killed her and immediately he along with his sons had gone to Govindavadhi Agaram and found that her daughter had died. He had further deposed that he had seen rope marks in the neck of his daughter and that he had given a complaint to Baluchetty Chatiram Police Station.

He had deposed that he had gone to his sister's house after hearing news and he had seen the body of the deceased let on the cot outside the house.

He had further deposed that he had taken her to a nearby Temple and asked her to come to his place and that on 26.06.2007, P.W.2 had informed about the death of his sister and both of them went to the house of the Appellant/A1.

18.P.W4-Ramu, is a witness to speak about the quarrel between the Appellant/A1 and the deceased, due to illicit intimacy between the Appellant/A1 and A-2 and he had not supported the case of prosecution and thereby he had been treated as hostile.

Explanation —For the purpose of this section, ""cruelty"" means— (a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or (b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.”
26.In the case on hand, the fact that the deceased had committed suicide by hanging is not disputed. In order to attract the provisions of Section 498A of IPC, the cruelty or harassment meted out to the wife by her husband or relatives of her husband should be to the extent that it became unbearable. Thus, the essential ingredients of Section 498A of IPC are (1) a woman must be married, (2) she must be subjected to cruelty and (3) cruelty must be of any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life and (4) the nature of harassment of such woman, with a view to coerce her to meet unlawful demand for property or valuable security.

27.As per the evidence of PW.1, father of the deceased, since the Appellant was having illicit intimacy, with his Aunt, A2 and he had given food to the http://www.judis.nic.in children of A2, there was a quarrel between the Appellant/A2 and the deceased and that they were living happily till the post marriage ceremony. PW.2, brother of the deceased and PW.3, friend of PW.2 and PW.4, a resident of the Village, had also deposed in similar lines. PW.6 is a hearsay witness.

28.PW.11, Revenue Divisional Officer had deposed that the death of the deceased was not on account of dowry demand. In Ex.P7, inquest report, PW.11 had opined that it came to light, from his enquiry with the witnesses that the death of the deceased did not occur due to dowry demand and that the Panchayatars, in their statements, had told that the deceased would appear to have died due to depression and due to poverty of the appellant and that there was a quarrel arisen between the Appellant/A1 and the deceased since she suspected illicit intimacy between Appellant/A1 and A2 and due to such quarrel and due to mental agony, the deceased committed suicide by hanging and that there were no injuries on her body, except the rope marks on her neck due to hanging.

29.It is seen from the analysis of the entire evidence that the deceased committed suicide, by hanging, due to mental agony caused by the alleged illicit intimacy, the Appellant/A1 had with A2 and due to the act of the Appellant/A1 in giving food to the children of his Aunt/A2.

30. The mere fact that the husband has developed some intimacy with another woman, during the subsistence of marriage and failed to discharge his marital obligations, would not amount to cruelty, but it must be of such a nature as is likely to drive the spouse to commit suicide to fall with the http://www.judis.nic.in explanation to Section 498A of IPC. The alleged extra-marital relationship is not of such a nature as to drive the wife to commit suicide. Even assuming that there is illicit relationship, unless some other acceptable evidence is let in to establish such high degree of mental cruelty, the explanation (a) to Section 498A of IPC, which includes cruelty to drive the woman to commit suicide, would not be attracted. But, in the case on hand, there is no material to prove that such an illicit intimacy existed between the Appellant/A1 and A2.

31.In 2015 11 SCC 753 (Ghusabhai Raisangbhai Chorasiya Vs. State of Gujarat), it was held as under:-

“21. ..... True it is, there is some evidence about the illicit relationship and even if the same is proven, we are of the considered opinion that cruelty, as envisaged under the first limb of Section 498A IPC would not get attracted. It would be difficult to hold that the mental cruelty was of such a degree that it would drive the wife to commit suicide. Mere extra-marital relationship, even if proved, would be illegal and immoral, as has been said in Pinakin Mahipatray Rawal [Pinakin Mahipatray Rawal v. State of Gujarat, (2013) 10 SCC 48 : (2013) 4 SCC (Civ) 616 : (2013) 3 SCC (Cri) 801] , but it would take a different character if the prosecution brings some evidence on record to show that the accused had conducted in such a manner to drive the wife to commit suicide. In the instant case, the accused may have been involved in an illicit relationship with Appellant 4, but in the absence of some other acceptable evidence on record that can establish such high degree of mental cruelty, the Explanation to Section 498A IPC which includes cruelty to drive a woman to commit suicide, would not be attracted.
32.In 2017 11 SCC 176 (K.V.Prakash Babu Vs. State of Karnataka), wherein the wife had committed suicide on suspicion of her husband having an extra- marital affair and it was held that if the husband gets involved in an extra- marital affair, that may not in all circumstances invite conviction under http://www.judis.nic.in Section 498A or 306 of IPC, but definitely that can be a ground for divorce or other reliefs in a matrimonial dispute under other enactments.

33.Though an acquittal under Section 306 of IPC itself is not a ground for acquittal under section 498A IPC, there must be a cogent material in the case of the prosecution to bring home the guilt of the accused for the offence under section 498A IPC. Further, the wilful act or conduct ought to be the proximate cause in order to bring home the charge under section 498A IPC.

34.Mere fact that the Appellant/A1 was alleged to have some intimacy A2 would not amount to cruelty and the cruelty must be of such a nature as likely to the spouse to commit suicide. In the opinion of this Court, the Prosecution has even failed to prove, by legal evidence that there was an illicit intimacy between the Appellant/A1 and A-2. When such being so, the evidence was let in by the prosecution falls short of the ingredients to bring the Act of the appellant within the explanation to Section 498A and the Prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond all reasonable doubts.

35.On perusal of the entire records and evidence in consonance with the above provisions, this Court is of the view that the Prosecution has not let in sufficient evidence to show that the Appellant/A1 had subjected the deceased/victim-his wife to cruelty, which was of such a nature as was likely to drive the victim to commit suicide or cause grave injury or danger to her life, limb or health, thereby satisfying the requirements of section 498A IPC.

36.Further, in the case on hand, the Trial Court, having found that there was no evidence for demand of dowry and the Appellant/A1 having abetted the victim to commit suicide, had acquitted the appellant/accused for the charges under sections 304(B) and 306 of IPC. However, strangely, on the same set http://www.judis.nic.in of facts, the Trial Court had found the Appellant/A1 guilty of the offence under Section 498A of IPC without there being any evidence that the Appellant/A1 by any wilful conduct committed cruelty which was of such a nature which had driven the victim to commit suicide and thereby, such a finding of guilty under Section 498A of IPC, in the opinion of this Court, is erroneous.

37.In view of the above findings,discussions and in the light of the decisions cited supra,, this Court is of the considered view that the impugned judgement of the Trial Court warrants interference and has to be set aside.

38.In so far as the decision of the Honourable Supreme Court, reported in 2018 9 SCC 621 (Siddaling Vs. State, Through Kalagi Police Station), relied by the learned Additional Public Prosecutor is concerned, since the facts of the said decision are different from that of the case on hand, it cannot be made applicable to the case on hand. In 2018 9 SCC 621 (Siddaling Vs. State, Through Kalagi Police Station), cited supra, the fact remains that the prosecution had led in evidence to prove the illicit relationship wherein the accused had admitted the illicit relationship whereas in this case, when the Prosecution has failed to prove that there was an illicit intimacy between the Appellant/A1 and A2 (acquitted accused), he cannot be convicted on mere presumptions and assumptions, without any legal evidence on record.

39. In the result, this criminal appeal is allowed. The impugned judgement of conviction and sentence is set aside. The Appellant/A1 is acquitted of the charges levelled against him. The bail bond if any executed by the Appellant/A1 shall stand cancelled and the fine amount if any paid by the http://www.judis.nic.in Appellant/A1 shall be refunded to him. This Court had earlier issued Non Bailable Warrant, to the Appellant/A1 and in view of the appeal is being allowed, the Non Bailable Warrant has been recalled. This Court places on record its appreciation for the active participation and assistance rendered by interns Mr.P.K.Suriya, Ms.Arumina Das, Ms.P.Elakkiya and Mr.Mohamed Ismail, Advocate is entitled to remuneration from the Tamil Nadu State Legal Service Authority as per norms.

                              ORAL ORDER
(PER: THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE M.NAGAPRASANNA)

1. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that in the connected matter, concerning co-accused, parole sought by a co-accused is dismissed in W.P.No.105032/2024. In that light, the learned counsel would submit that the same order would be applicable to the petitioner as well.


2. The Coordinate Bench of this Court while dismissing the petition, has held as follows:

""Heard learned counsel for the petitioner Sri Raghavendra Purohit and learned HCGP for respondents- State.
2. Petitioner is before this Court seeking to quash the proceedings of respondent No.5- vide Annexure-C, who on the basis of report submitted by respondent No.4 has rejected the parole request. Petitioner has been convicted for the offences punishable under Sections 498A, 302 and 506 of IPC in Sessions Case No.204/2008 is undergoing imprisonment for life by the order dated 30.07.2014. Despite an appeal being preferred against the Judgment of conviction and order of sentence, the same came to be dismissed confirming the Judgment of conviction rendered by the trial Court.
NC: 2025:KHC-D:2
3. It is the case of petitioner that she is in judicial custody since the year 2008 for more than 16 years. Petitioner was once released on parole on 27.04.2023 by virtue of an order passed in Writ Petition No.102358/2023 by this Court. It is contended by learned counsel for the petitioner that petitioner does not have any other criminal antecedents and she gave a representation to respondent No.5 five to release her on parole for the reason that she wants to cultivate her land. The said letter was forwarded to respondent No.4 for securing information and opinion with regard to releasing the petitioner on parole. Respondent No.4 has evaluated and provided a negative opinion for the request of release of parole of the petitioner on the ground that there is life threat to the relatives of victim by the petitioner. Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that based on the opinion expressed by respondent No.4, respondent No.5 issued endorsement rejecting the application of the petitioner for release on parole, which is questioned here.
4. It is the vehement contention of learned counsel for the petitioner that father of the petitioner died on 21.11.2023 and her mother is 75 years aged and due to her old age, she is unable to look after the agricultural land, which is lying barren and vacant. Hence, there is requirement of the petitioner to be released on parole for taking care of the land and to plough the land. Hence a requisition was made for release on parole which has been arbitrarily rejected without application of mind and the same requires to be set aside and consequently, the petitioner to be granted parole.
NC: 2025:KHC-D:2
5. Per contra, the learned HCGP representing the State vehemently contends that the only reason sought for release on parole is on the ground that the land of petitioner's mother requires to be ploughed and cultivated. There is no inherent requirement of the petitioner for taking care of the land. It is contended that some other persons could be engaged and on the contrary, there are complaints and objections raised by the complainant-victims contending that there is an imminent threat to the complainants in case of release of parole of the petitioner and their life would be in danger. Considering these aspects of threat and complaints and objections raised and on the opinion of respondent No.4, respondent No.5 rejected the application, seeking parole which is correctly done it does not stem from any ill will or arbitrariness. Under the circumstances, learned HCGP seeks to dismiss the petition as being devoid of merits.
6. Having heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned HCGP for respondents, it is to be seen while granting parole, what is the requirement and imminent urgency for grant of parole. The urgency shown is only with regard to cultivation of land and ploughing of land, which could be organized by the petitioner or the surviving members through another person other than the petitioner. The second important aspect is the opinion expressed by respondent No.4 on the basis of complaint received by the complainant and victims that there being an apparent imminent threat to their life and safety and security, if the petitioner is released on parole. This being the main reason, a negative opinion is given by NC: 2025:KHC-D:2 respondent No.4 for release of parole, which is accepted by respondent No.5 and has rightly rejected the application for parole.
7. As stated earlier, parole can be granted to the petitioner to fulfill certain requirements, which could only be done by the petitioner and no one else and on the basis of her antecedents and on a clean chit or a report given by respondent No.4 on the basis of opinion, complaints from the complainants/victims. In the present case on hand, both the points for consideration being negative. The respondent No.5 has rightly rejected the application for parole. This Court does not find any urgency or immediate requirement or need for the petitioner to be released on parole. Under the circumstances, the reasons assigned by respondent No.5 do not call for any interference. This petition is devoid of merits. Accordingly, I pass the following:
ORDER This petition is dismissed.""
3. In the aforesaid light, petition is dismissed.

Sri. Jithendra P vs The State Of Karnataka on 6 January, 2025
This petition by accused No.4 in C.C.No.1884/2022 on the file of the Principal Civil Judge (Jr.Dn.) and JMFC, Kanakapura, Ramanagara District (for short ""the Trial Court"") is filed seeking the following reliefs:

""(i) Quash the criminal proceedings pending against the petitioner in C.C.No.1884/2022 for the offences punishable under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506, 114, 149 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 at Annexure-A NC: 2025:KHC:103 pending on the file of the Principal Civil Judge (Jr.Dn.) & JMFC Court, Kanakapura, Ramanagara District.
ii) Quash the Charge Sheet at Annexure-B in C.C.No.1884/2022, for the offences punishable under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506, 114, 149 of the IPC, 1860 at Annexure-A pending on the file of Principal Civil Judge (Jr. Dn.) & JMFC Court, Kanakapura, Ramanagara District.""
2. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned Additional State Public Prosecutor for respondent No.1 and perused the material on record.


3. In addition to reiterating the various contentions urged in the petition and referring to the material on record, learned counsel for the petitioner invited my attention to the FIR in Crime No.133/2022 as well as the charge sheet and documents produced along with the charge sheet in order to point out that there is no material to establish commission of the offence under Section 498-A, 323, 504, 506, 114, 149 of IPC in so far as the petitioner is concerned. It is submitted that respondent No.2 is the wife of one Praveen and merely because the petitioner was an acquaintance of the said Praveen, who was the husband of the complainant, the petitioner has been falsely dragged into the said matrimonial NC: 2025:KHC:103 dispute between respondent No.2 and her husband - accused No.2 and their family members and as such, the impugned proceedings qua the petitioner deserves to be quashed.

4. Respondent No.2 having been served with notice of this petition, has chosen to remain unrepresented and has not contested the present petition.


5. As rightly contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner, a perusal of the contents of the FIR, charge sheet and charge sheet material accompanying the charge sheet is sufficient to come to the conclusion that no prima facie offence is made out as against the petitioner, particularly when the allegations against the petitioner, who merely happens to be the friend of husband of respondent No.2 are vague and bald and no specific overt acts, deeds or things alleged against the petitioner. Under these circumstances, in the light of the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Digambar and Another Vs. The State of Maharashtra and Another - (2024) SCC OnLine SC 3836, which deals with the provisions contained in Section 498-A IPC, I am of the considered opinion that continuation of the proceedings as against the NC: 2025:KHC:103 petitioner would tantamount to abuse of process of the Court warranting interference in the present petition.

6. In the result, I pass the following:

ORDER
(i) The Criminal Petition is allowed.
(ii) The impugned criminal proceedings in C.C.No.1884/2022 pending on the file of the Principal Civil Judge (Jr.Dn.) and JMFC, Kanakapura, Ramanagara District, are hereby quashed qua the petitioner - accused No.4 is concerned.

Ram Kewal Verma vs State Of U.P.,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/76202283/,"Allahabad High Court
Ram Kewal Verma vs State Of U.P. And Another on 6 January, 2025
1. List has been revised.

2. Heard Sri Dharmendra Kumar Pandey, learned counsel for the applicant and Sri Ramakant Singh, learned counsel for the informant as well as Sri Ram Mohit Yadav, learned A.G.A. for the State and perused the record.

3. Applicant seeks bail in Case Crime No. 168 of 2024, under Sections 498A, 304B, 302 I.P.C. and Section 3/4 of D.P. Act, Police Station Ubhaon, District Ballia, during the pendency of trial.

PROSECUTION STORY:

4. The marriage of the sister of the informant was solemnized with the applicant as per Hindu rites on 21.04.2022. The applicant and other family members are stated to have subjected her to cruelty for demand of dowry.

5. The informant got the information of the death of his sister on 03.06.2024 whereby it was found that the deceased person had committed suicide along with her 16 months old daughter. The deceased was pregnant at that time.

ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF APPLICANT :

6. The applicant has been falsely implicated in the present case and he has nothing to do with the said offence.

7. The FIR is delayed by about two days and there is no explanation of the said delay caused.

8. The applicant had informed the police about the said suicide and the police had come to the house of the applicant and broke open the door. The said fact finds mention in the inquest proceeding itself.

9. The applicant is the panch witness no.3 to the said inquest proceedings.

10. The brother of the informant had reached the place of occurrence on 03.06.2024 which finds mentioned in the FIR itself.

11. The said inordinate delay speaks volume of false implication.

12. The deceased was depressed and had committed the said offence of murder of her daughter along with her own suicide.

13. The applicant had filed an application before the District Magistrate, Ballia on 09.10.2023 whereby he has suspected that the deceased might commit suicide and commit the murder of other family members, as such, the prosecution story falsified.

14. Several other submissions have been made on behalf of the applicant to demonstrate the falsity of the allegations made against him. The circumstances which, as per counsel, led to the false implication of the applicant have also been touched upon at length.

15. There is no criminal history of the applicant. The applicant is languishing in jail since 10.07.2024. The applicant is ready to cooperate with trial. In case, the applicant is released on bail, he will not misuse the liberty of bail.

ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF INFORMANT :

16. The bail application has been vehemently opposed but the submissions raised by the learned counsel for the applicant could not be disputed.

CONCLUSION:

17. The well-known principle of ""Presumption of Innocence Unless Proven Guilty,"" gives rise to the concept of bail as a rule and imprisonment as an exception.

18. A person's right to life and liberty, guaranteed by Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, cannot be taken away simply because the person is accused of committing an offence until the guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt. Article 21 of the Indian Constitution states that no one's life or personal liberty may be taken away unless the procedure established by law is followed, and the procedure must be just and reasonable. The said principle has been recapitulated by the Supreme Court in Satender Kumar Antil Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and Ors., 2022 INSC 690.

19. Reiterating the aforesaid view the Supreme Court in the case of Manish Sisodia Vs. Directorate of Enforcement 2024 INSC 595 has again emphasised that the very well-settled principle of law that bail is not to be withheld as a punishment is not to be forgotten. It is high time that the Courts should recognize the principle that ""bail is a rule and jail is an exception"".

20. Learned AGA could not bring forth any exceptional circumstances which would warrant denial of bail to the applicant.

21. It is settled principle of law that the object of bail is to secure the attendance of the accused at the trial.

Arunkumar vs The State,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/180949592/,"Madras High Court
Arunkumar vs The State Rep By on 30 September, 2020
This petition has been filed to quash the proceedings in C.C.No.415 of 2019 on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate-1, Tiruvallur, thereby taken cognizance for the offences under Sections 498A & 406 of IPC as against the petitioner.


2. The learned counsel would submit that the petitioner is a sole accused. Initially the second respondent herein lodged complainant on 20.06.2019 and the same was registered in Crime No.13 of 2019 for the offences under Section 498A, 406 & 506(i) of IPC as against four accused persons. After completion of investigation, the first respondent filed final report for the offences under Sections 498A & 406 of IPC as against the petitioner alone. The allegations are that the marriage took place between the petitioner and the second respondent on 26.06.2015 and at that time of marriage, the second respondent was presented 50 sovereign of jewels, 1½ Kg silver articles and other house hold articles by her parents. After their marriage, they lived in the mother-in-law's house only for 10 days and thereafter shifted their residence to Kerala, since her husband was working at Kerala. Thereafter, the family members of the petitioner harassed her and also demanded huge http://www.judis.nic.in dowry to live with her husband. In fact, they also hided the petitioner herein and refused to live with the petitioner herein. On 07.08.2016 the defacto complainant was driven out from the matrimonial house. Thereafter on 24.08.2016, the petitioner issued notice for seeking divorce to the second respondent herein. All the accused persons are threatened her to give consent for divorce between the petitioner and second respondent. Further alleged that the gold jewels and also silver articles have been under custody of her in-laws and demanded huge dowry to re-union between the petitioner and the second respondent.


2.1. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner further submitted that the entire allegations are completely false and the complaint itself lodged after period of three years. Admittedly, the second respondent was driven out from the matrimonial house on 07.08.2016, whereas the complaint lodged only on 20.06.2019. On the date of receipt of the complaint itself, the first respondent registered the case and on same day the investigating officer examined almost all the witnesses shown in the list of witnesses. He further submitted that in fact the in-laws of the petitioner filed a petition for not to harass before this Court in Crl.O.P.No.15937 of 2019 and this Court by an http://www.judis.nic.in order dated 21.06.2019, directed the first respondent to conduct enquiry and take further action in accordance with law. Further observed that it is made clear that if the first respondent finds that it is a matrimonial dispute, the first respondent police shall relegate the parties to approach appropriate family Court. It clearly shows that this Court by an order dated 21.06.2019 only directed the first respondent to conduct enquiry. However the FIR has been registered on 20.06.2019. If at all the FIR registered on that day, definitely the respondent police would have represented before this Court that already FIR has been registered. Therefore, the FIR itself pre-dated one and on the date registration of FIR itself, all the list of witnesses have been examined by the first respondent.


2.2. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would further submit that the petitioner issued notice to the second respondent on 24.08.2016, thereby called upon the second respondent that the petitioner no longer wants to live with the second respondent at Thiruvallur and intended to file petition for divorce. On receipt of the same, on 27.08.2016, the second respondent's father along with one Rajakumar and others came to the petitioner's house and assaulted the parents of the petitioner herein and also http://www.judis.nic.in abused them with filthy language, and threatened them with dire consequences. Therefore, the petitioner's father lodged complaint before the Inspector of Police, Thiruvallur and the same was registered in Crime No.671 of 2016 for the offences under Sections 294(b), 323 & 506(1) of IPC and it is pending for investigation.


2.3. The petitioner filed petition for divorce on the ground of cruelty in H.M.O.P.No.103 of 2016 against the second respondent herein on the file of the Family Court, Tiruvallur. In fact, the matter was referred before Lok Adalath for compromise on several occasions but, no negotiation had been taken place and the second respondent did not come for any settlement. Therefore, the matter was again referred back to Court for trial. Thereafter, she filed a petition for restitution of conjugal rights in H.M.O.P.No.504 of 2017 on the file of the learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Chennai. The second respondent also filed a transfer petition in Tr.C.M.P.194 of 2017 to transfer the divorce petition to the Family Court, Chennai. This Court by an order dated 09.06.2017 transferred the both O.Ps. filed by the petitioner as well as the second respondent to the Subordinate Court, Tambaram and renumbered as H.M.O.P.Nos.692 & 830 of 2017 respectively. In the said proceedings, there is http://www.judis.nic.in absolutely no whisper about the allegations made in FIR. In fact, the second respondent also filed domestic violence case in D.V.C.No.30 of 2018 as against the petitioner on the file of the Additional Mahila Court, Allikulam. It is also seen that in the restitution of conjugal rights petition, the trial Court ordered maintenance of Rs.10,000/- and the same was challenged by the petitioner in C.R.P.No.3856 of 2018 and this Court by order dated 14.03.2019 reduced the same to Rs.7,000/- per month. While being so, the second respondent suppressed the above events between them and only to harass the petitioner, lodged the present complaint with false allegations on 20.06.2019. Therefore, the entire proceedings are nothing but clear abuse of process of law.

2.4. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner further submitted that no witness has been spoken about the role played by the petitioner and there is no specific allegations are made out from the entire material produced by the first respondent herein as against the petitioner to attract the offence under Section 498A of IPC. There is no explanations from the second respondent for the belated complaint. Admittedly she left the matrimonial home on 07.08.2016 and lodged the present complaint only on 20.06.2019 that too suppressing the entire facts with regard to filing of divorce petition and http://www.judis.nic.in restitution of conjugal rights petition and also domestic violence cases. Therefore, it is nothing but clear abuse of process of law and only with an intention to wreck vengeance as against the petitioner, this false complaint has been lodged as against the petitioner. To support of his contention, he relied upon the following judgments :-

i) (2009) 10 SCC 604 - Bhaskar Lal Sharma and anr Vs. Monica
ii) (2009) 14 SCC 466 - Shakson Belthissor Vs. State of Kerala and anr
iii) (2014) 13 SCC 567 - Swapnil and ors Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh
iv) (2017) 9 SCC 413 - Varala Bharath Kumar Vs. State of Telangana and anr.
v) (2018) 13 SCC 747 - Kartik chandra Majee and ors Vs. State of Jarkhand and anr.
Therefore, he sought for quashment of the entire proceedings.

3. Per contra, the learned counsel appearing for the second respondent/defacto complainant filed counter and submitted that other proceedings pending between the petitioner and the second respondent are not impediment for her to lodge this complaint for the offences committed by the petitioner herein. The offence under Section 498A of IPC is a continuous offence and cause of action arose even immediately after the marriage between the petitioner and the second respondent. The family members of the petitioner harassed the second respondent by demanding huge dowry. Till the lodgement of the complaint, there was harassment by the petitioner and his family http://www.judis.nic.in members demanding huge dowry from the second respondent and her family members.


3.1. He further submitted that the witnesses categorically have spoken about the overt-act of the petitioner in respect of harassment and also demand of huge dowry. The observation Mahazar witnesses have spoken about the overtact and also independent witnesses viz., the neighbours have also spoken about the overtact of the petitioner herein to attract the offence under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC. He further submitted that during the marriage, her parents presented 50 sovereign of gold and 1½ Kg of silver articles. Her husband was working as software engineer in Kerala and therefore the second respondent stayed along with the petitioner at Kerala. During the month of March, 2016, when they came to Chennai, the petitioner left the second respondent in her parents house stating that he would take her back after shifting the residence at Kerala. Thereafter, when the parents of the second respondent had taken her to the house of the petitioner at Thiruvallur, the second respondent was not even permitted to enter into the house, and the parents of the petitioner abused them with filthy language and also threatened them only after receiving the huge dowry, they will allow the second http://www.judis.nic.in respondent to live with her husband. The petitioner and her family members continuously harassed the second respondent to the core and demanded huge sum of dowry.


3.2. He further submitted that the second respondent is also taking steps to impleade the parents of the petitioner in the present proceedings. The grounds raised by the petitioner are factually disputed and it cannot be considered by this Court under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. Further the evidences and materials cannot be appreciated by this Court that too under the quash petition filed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. He also relied upon the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as follows:-

i) Crl.A.No.579 of 2019 dated 02.04.2019 - Devendra Prasad Singh Vs. State of Bihar & Anr.
ii) Crl.A.No.1572 of 2019 dated 17.10.2019 -Central Bureau of Invstigation Vs. Arvind Khanna.
iii) Crl.A.No.1817 of 2019 dated 02.12.2019 - M.Jayanthi Vs. K.R.Meenakshi & anr.
Therefore, he sought for dismissal of the quash petition. http://www.judis.nic.in

4. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that on the complaint lodged by the second respondent, the first respondent registered a case in Crime No.13 of 2019 for the offences punishable under Section 498(A), 406 and 506(i) of IPC, as against the four accused persons, in which the petitioner is arrayed as A1. On the date of registration of FIR, the first respondent recorded the statements of L.Ws.1 to 8, 14, 16. Other witnesses have been examined on the next day viz., 21.06.2019. Thereafter the first respondent filed final report only as against the petitioner, after filing alteration report thereby deleting the other accused persons 2 to 4 on 19.10.2019 and filed final report. The same has been taken cognizance by the trial Court in C.C.No.415 of 2019 and it is pending.


4.1. He further submitted that there are specific allegations and overtact as against the petitioner for the offences under Sections 498(A) and 406 of IPC. The offence under Section 498A of IPC is a continuous offence and as such though the second respondent lodged complaint on 20.06.2019, there were continuous harassment by the petitioner herein by demanding huge dowry. He further submitted that the jewels and silver articles, which were presented in her marriage also under the custody of the petitioner and his http://www.judis.nic.in family members. Therefore the offence under Section 406 of IPC is also clearly attracted as against the petitioner and all the points raised by the petitioner herein are mixed questions of fact and it cannot be considered here. Therefore, he sought for dismissal of this petition.


5. Heard Mr.J.Saravanavel, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, Mr.P.Kumaresan, learned counsel appearing for the second respondent and Mr.S.Karthikeyan, learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the first respondent.


6. The petitioner is a sole accused. On the complaint lodged by the second respondent on 20.06.2019, the first respondent registered FIR in Crime No.13 of 2019 for the offences punishable under Sections 498(A), 406, 506(1) of IPC as against four accused persons in which the petitioner is arrayed as A1. The first respondent after completion of investigation, filed final report on 19.10.2019 thereby deleting the accused A2 to A3 and filed the charge sheet as against the petitioner alone for the offences under Sections 498(A) and 406 of IPC.

http://www.judis.nic.in

7. Admittedly, the petitioner was married with the second respondent on 20.06.2015 and after their marriage they stayed at Kerala, since the petitioner was employed at Kerala. Thereafter, the second respondent left the matrimonial home 07.08.2016 for the reason that the petitioner and his family members harassed the second respondent and also demanded huge dowry. Thereafter the parents of the second respondent had threatened the petitioner's father over telephone as such, the petitioner's father lodged complaint before the Inspector of Police, Town Police Station, Thiruvallur, and on receipt of the same the petitioner's father was issued CSR on 07.08.2016.

8. Thereafter, the petitioner caused legal notice dated 25.08.2016 to the second respondent stating that the second respondent harassed the petitioner and also every day there was a threat by the second respondent through police. Therefore, he did not want to live with the second respondent and call upon the second respondent that longer wanted to live with her and intended to file a petition for divorce. On receipt of the same, the second respondent did not send any reply to the petitioner. In fact on 27.08.2016, the petitioner's father lodged complaint alleging that the second respondent and one Rajkumar had come to the petitioner's house and assaulted the parents' and http://www.judis.nic.in also threatened them with dire consequences. Therefore, the petitioner's father lodged complaint and the same was registered in Crime No.671 of 2016 for the offences under Sections 294(b), 323, 506(i) of IPC as against the second respondent's father and one Rajkumar and it is pending for investigation.

9. Thereafter, the petitioner filed petition for divorce on the ground of cruelty in H.M.O.P.No.103 of 2016 on the file of the Family Court, Tiruvallur. There was a mediation between the petitioner and the second respondent and all are went to vain. Further, the second respondent filed a petition for restitution of conjugal rights in H.M.O.P.No.504 of 2017 on the file of the Principal Judge, Family Court, Chennai. The second respondent also filed a transfer petition in Tr.C.M.P.194 of 2017 to transfer the divorce petition to the Family Court, Chennai. The petitioner also filed a transfer petition in Tr.C.M.P.No.363 of 2017 to transfer the restitution of conjugal rights petition to the Family Court, Tiruvallur. This Court considered both the transfer petitions and by an order dated 09.06.2017 transferred both the petitions filed by the petitioner as well as the second respondent to the Subordinate Court, Tambaram, and both petitions are pending for trial. http://www.judis.nic.in

10. The second respondent also filed a complaint under the Domestic Violence Act in D.V.C.No.30 of 2018 on the file of the Additional Mahila Court, Allikulam, Chennai and it is pending for trial. In fact, an interim maintenance was ordered as against the petitioner to pay a sum of Rs.10,000/- to the second respondent and as against which, the petitioner filed a Civil Revision Petition in C.R.P.No.3856 of 2018 and this Court by an order dated 14.03.2019, reduced the monthly maintenance from Rs.10,000/- to Rs.7,000/-.

11. On perusal of the records, it shows that the petitioner's parents filed a petition before this Court for direction directing the first respondent not to harass, in Crl.O.P.No.15937 of 2019. This Court by an order dated 21.06.2019, directed the first respondent to conduct an enquiry and take further action in accordance with law. This Court further observed that if the first respondent finds that it is a matrimonial dispute, the first respondent police shall relegate the parties to approach the appropriate family Court. It is unfortunate to state that the first respondent did not represent anything before this Court about the registration of FIR as against the petitioner herein in Crime No.13 of 2019 on 20.06.2019. In fact, the first respondent have examined and recorded the statements under Section 161(3) of Cr.P.C., almost http://www.judis.nic.in from all the witnesses on 21.06.2019. The first respondent completed the investigation and filed final report on 19.10.2019. It would clearly show that in a single day, the first respondent registered the FIR and also examined all the list of witnesses.


12. It is also seen from the statements, all are stereo type and in fact the neighbours have stated that there was no dowry harassment. In fact, the pendency of the proceeding between the petitioner and the second respondent are not at all considered by the first respondent and since the second respondent and her supporting evidences did not even whisper about those proceedings. It is settled law that the offence under Section 498A is a continuous offence. But in this case on hand, there is no explanation for the delay in lodgement of complaint by the second respondent. Admittedly, she left the matrimonial home on 07.08.2016. Thereafter there are so many proceedings, including the domestic violence complaint between the petitioner and the second respondent. All the matters are now pending for trial before the respective Courts. The second respondent suppressing all those facts and lodged complaint without any date of occurrence, place of occurrence and without any specific overtact as against the petitioner. The first respondent http://www.judis.nic.in registered the case on the receipt of complaint itself without conducting any enquriy on 20.06.2019 and on the same day the first respondent recorded the statement under Section 161(3) of Cr.P.C., from all the witnesses expect two witness. This Court and the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India repeatedly held that in the matter related to the family Court offences, the police official has to conduct preliminary enquiry and only thereafter if any cognizable offence is made out can register the case. In the case on hand, on the same day, everything has been done and filed final report. Fortunately, the first respondent deleted other accused persons viz., the parents and relatives of the petitioner herein from the charge sheet.


13. In this regard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner relied upon the judgment reported in (2009) 14 SCC 466 in the case of Shakson Belthissor Vs. State of Kerala and anr, in which the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held as follows :-

""28. The said section contains an explanation, which defines ""cruelty"" as understood under Section 498A IPC. In order to understand the meaning of the expression `cruelty' as envisaged under Section 498A, there must be such a conduct on the part of the husband or http://www.judis.nic.in relatives of the husband of woman which is of such a nature as to cause the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health whether mental or physical of the woman.
29. When we examine the facts of the present case particularly the FIR and the charge sheet we find that there is no such allegation either in the FIR or in the charge sheet making out a prima facie case as narrated under explanation
(a). There is no allegation that there is any such conduct on the part of the appellant which could be said to be amounting to cruelty of such a nature as is likely to cause the Respondent No. 2 to commit suicide or to cause any injury to her life. The ingredient to constitute an offence under explanation (a) of Section 498A IPC are not at all mentioned either in FIR or in charge sheet and in absence thereof, no case is made out. Therefore, explanation (a) as found in Section 498A IPC is clearly not attracted in the present case.
30. We, therefore, now proceed to examine as to whether the case would fall under explanation (b) of Section 498A of IPC constituting cruelty of the nature as mentioned in explanation (b). In order to constitute cruelty http://www.judis.nic.in under the said provision there has to be harassment of the woman with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or a case is to be made out to the effect that there is a failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand. When the allegation made in the FIR and charge sheet is examined in the present case in the light of the aforesaid provision, we find that no prima facie case even under the aforesaid provision is made out to attract a case of cruelty.
31. The marriage between the appellant and Respondent No. 2 was performed on 23.10.1997 when it is alleged that Rs. 5 lakhs was given by the parents of Respondent No. 2 to the family of appellant as dowry. The FIR was filed in the month of April, 2002 and in the said FIR there is no allegation that subsequent thereto any harassment was made by the appellant with a view to coercing her or any person related to Respondent No. 2 to meet any unlawful demand or any property. In that view of the matter neither explanation (a) nor explanation (b) of Section 498 A of IPC is attracted in the present case.
http://www.judis.nic.in

32. It is crystal clear that neither in the FIR nor in the charge sheet there is any ingredient of Section 498A IPC, which could prima facie constitute a case of cruelty as defined in that Section. It is thus established that on a reading of the FIR as also the charge sheet filed against the appellant no case under Section 498A is made out on the face of the record, and therefore, both the FIR as also the charge sheet are liable to be quashed in exercise of the powers under Section 482 of the CrPC. Clearly, the High Court failed to appreciate the facts in proper perspective, and therefore, committed an error on the face of the record.""


14. He also relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India reported in (2014) 13 SCC 567 in the case of Swapnil and ors Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, as follows :-

“11. The second respondent has been living separately since April, 2011 and hence, there is no question of any beating by the appellants as alleged by her. The relationship having got strained ever since April, 2011, even application for restitution of conjugal rights having been http://www.judis.nic.in withdrawn on 16.04.2012 as the second respondent was not interested to live together, it is difficult to believe that there is still a demand for dowry on 30.04.2012 coupled with criminal intimidation. The allegations are vague and bereft of the details as to the place and the time of the incident. We had called for the records and have gone through the same. The materials before the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Indore are not sufficient to form an opinion that there is ground for presuming that the accused appellants have committed the offence under the charged Sections. The Additional Sessions Court and the High Court missed these crucial points while considering the petition filed by the appellants under Section 397 and Section 482 of the Cr.PC respectively. The veiled object behind the lame prosecution is apparently to harass the appellants. We are, hence, of the view that the impugned prosecution is wholly unfounded.""
15. In another judgment reported in (2017) 9 SCC 413 in the case of Varala Bharath Kumar Vs. State of Telangana and anr, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held as follows:-

                                       “8.   We     are   conscious     of   the   fact

http://www.judis.nic.in



                                 that, Section 498A was added to the Code with a
view to punish the husband or any of his relatives, who harass or torture the wife to coerce her or her relatives to satisfy unlawful demands of dowry. Keeping the afore-mentioned object in mind, we have dealt with the matter. We do not find any allegation of subjecting the complainant to cruelty within the meaning of Section 498A of IPC. The records at hand could not disclose any willful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the complainant to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the complainant. So also, there is nothing on record to show that there was a demand of dowry by the appellants or any of their relatives, either prior to the marriage, during the marriage or after the marriage. The record also does not disclose anywhere that the husband of the complainant acted, with a view to coerce her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand of any property or valuable security.

9. The ingredients of criminal breach of trust are also not forthcoming from the records as against the appellants. The allegations contained in the complaint and the charge sheet do not http://www.judis.nic.in satisfy the definition of criminal breach of trust, as contained in Section 405 of the I.P.C. In view of the blurred allegations, and as we find that the complainant is only citing the incidents of unhappiness with her husband, no useful purpose will be served in continuing the prosecution against the appellants. This is a case where there is a total absence of allegations for the offences punishable under Section 498A and Section 406 of the I.P.C. In the matter on hand, the allegations made in the First Information Report as well as the material collected during the investigation, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety, do not prima facie constitute the offences punishable under Section 498A and 406 of the IPC against the accused/appellants. So also the uncontroverted allegations found against the appellants do not disclose the commission of the offence alleged and make out a case against the accused. The proceedings initiated against the appellants are liable to be quashed.” In the above cases, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held that the word ""cruelty"" has envisage under Section 498A of IPC there must be such a conduct on the part of the husband or relatives of the husband of woman which http://www.judis.nic.in is of such a nature as to cause the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health whether mental or physical of the woman.


16. In the case on hand, there is no such allegations in the FIR as well as the statement of the witnesses. The ingredients to constitute the offence under explanation A of 498 of IPC are not at all mentioned in the FIR and also in the statement of the witnesses. When the absence there of, no offence is made out under Section 498A of IPC as against the petitioner. Insofar as the offence under Section 406 of IPC is concerned the allegation made in the FIR as well as the statements do not satisfy the definition of the criminal breach of trust as contained in Section 405 of IPC. It is relevant to extract the offence under Sections 405 of IPC as follows :-

""405. Criminal breach of trust — Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that property, or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal http://www.judis.nic.in contract, express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any other person so to do, commits ""criminal breach of trust"".
406. Punishment for criminal breach of trust — Whoever commits criminal breach of trust shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.""

The entire allegations are bald and vague and no ingredient is there to attract the offence under Section 406 of IPC.


17. On perusal of the petition filed by the second respondent in H.M.O.P.No.504 of 2017 for restitution of conjugal rights, she stated that only because of the parents of the petitioner herein, there was misunderstanding between them. She further stated that there is no difference of opinion whatsoever between the petitioner and the second respondent and their separation was not on account of them and it is because of her in-laws. Therefore the present impugned proceeding is nothing but after thought and it is clear abuse of process of law. After filing the divorce petition, restitution of conjugal rights petition and also the domestic violence complaint, the present complaint has been lodged by the second respondent. Therefore it is nothing http://www.judis.nic.in but only to wreck vengeance as against the petitioner, the complaint has been lodged by the second respondent.


18. In this regard it is relevant to relay upon the judgment reported in (1992) SCC Crl. 426 in the case of Bajanlal v. State of Haryana, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has listed out the following category of case in which the criminal proceedings can be quashed using the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C.:

""102..................
7. Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with malafide and/or where the proceedings is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wrecking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.""
19. Therefore the entire proceedings is liable to be quashed and it cannot be sustained, since no offence is made out as against the petitioner as alleged by the prosecution. There is absolutely no ingredient to prove the charges for the offences punishable under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC, as against the petitioner. The allegations made in the final report as well as the http://www.judis.nic.in materials collected during the investigation, even if they are taken their face value, the acceptability of their entirety do not constitute the offences punishable under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC as against the petitioner herein. Therefore, there is absolutely no possibility of conviction to the petitioner for the offences under Sections 498A and 406 of IPC. Therefore, the petitioner need not go for ordeal of trial. As such the judgments cited by the learned counsel for the second respondent are not helpful to the case of the second respondent.


20. Accordingly, this criminal original petition is allowed and the proceeding in C.C.No.415 of 2019 on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate-1, Tiruvallur, is hereby quashed. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are also closed.

---- Respondent For Petitioner : Mr. Vivek Mishra, Advocate For Respondent No.1 : Mr. Avline Juneja Gambhir, P.L. For Respondent No. 2 : Mr. Manoj Chauhan, Advocate ___________________________________________________________ Hon'ble Shri Justice Arvind Kumar Verma, Order on Board 06.01.2025

1. The present petitioner has filed this petition under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 with the following prayer:-

""It is therefore most humbly prayed that the Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to allow the instant petition and may kindly pleased to quash the criminal case No. 10314/2021 pending before the court of JMFC Raipur (CG) in the interest of justice""
2. Case of the prosecution, as per first information report is that the complainant was regularly facing harassment and cruelty due to demand of dowry and she was not taken care by her husband and his family members during her ill health and she was restrained to go to her parental house during major Hindu festivals. With the aforesaid allegation, the FIR was lodged against husband, mother-in-law, father- in-law, sister-in-law and brother-in-law. The case was taken into investigation and during the course of investigation, the police recorded the statement under Section 161 of Cr.P.C. of the complainant, her mother, father, brother and sister. On the basis of allegation, charge- sheet was submitted before the learned judicial magistrate. The brother- in-law was exonerated from the charges levelled against him. All four accused persons were granted bail by the learned court below and now the matter is fixed for framing of charges before the Trial Court.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner who is sister-in-law of the complainant got married in the year 2015 and She was appointed as Sikha Karmi Grade-2 at Govt. School and posted at District Bemetara. She is living with husband separately since her marriage, therefore there is no possibility to give ill treatment to the complainant by the petitioner and there is also no allegation of demand of dowry and cruelty due to such demand against the present petitioner. No offence under Section 498A IPC is made out as no role is attributed by the petitioner in causing any kind of physical or mental harassment to the complainant. In support of his contention, learned counsel for petitioner relied upon a decision of the Supreme Court in the case of State of Haryana Vs. Bhajan Lal report in (1992 Supp. (1) SCC 335) whereby it has held that High Court can quash the Fir to protect the accused from malicious prosecution.

4. Further, learned counsel for the petitioner also relied upon a decision of the Division Bench of this High Court in the matter of Manoj Singh V. State of Chhattisgarh passed in CRMP No. 2637/2019, whereby the Division Bench has held in para 21 as under:-

21 In the matter of K. Subba Rao and others V. State of Telangana represented by its Secretary, Department of Home and others reported in (2018) 14 SCC 452 their Lordships of the Supreme Court delineated the duty of the criminal Courts while proceeding against relatives of victim's husband and held that the Court should be careful in proceeding against distant relatives in crime pertaining to matrimonial disputes and dowry deaths and further held that relatives of husband should not be roped in on the basis of omnibus allegations, unless specific instances of their involvement in offences are made out.
5. Learned State counsel for respondent No. 1 and learned counsel for respondent No. 2 would further submit that after due investigation the petitioner has been charge-sheeted for the aforesaid offences and prima- facie material collected are sufficient to put the petitioner at trial. They would further submit that taking into consideration the material available on record, it cannot be held that no prima-facie case against the petitioner is made out. They would also submit that jurisdiction of this Court under Section 482 of the CrPC is extremely limited as FIR and charge-sheet cannot be quashed particularly when there is sufficient evidence available on record to put the accused person to trial. They would rely upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court as well as Hon'ble High Court in the matters of ""State of Harayana Vs. Bhajan Lal"" reported in AIR 1992 SC 604 and State of Orissa & Ors. Versus Ujjal Kumar Burdhan reproted in (2012) 4 SCC 547 and also Jeffrey J. Diermeier & Anr. Vs. State of West Bengal & Anr. reported in (2010) 6 SCC 243. In view of the abovementioned judgments, the instant petition under Section 482 may not be maintainable as no facts and grounds have been urged by the petitioner warranting any interference by Hon'ble court. The instant petition deserves to be dismissed being baseless and devoid of merits.

6. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the pleadings and prayers made in the petition and documents available on record.

7. It is admitted facts that written complaint was made by respondent No.2- Vaishali Alias Kiran Sahu on 02.07.2021 in Police Station Raipur in which it has been alleged that from the very beginning of the marriage, the petitioner along with her husband and her in-laws have physically and mentally tortured the complainant and assaulted her, hence, she has left the house of the husband.

8. Perusal of the charge-sheet indicates that the allegation levelled against the petitioner for the offence under Section 498-A of IPC are general and bald. There is also no dates and details of any incident has been mentioned in the complainant. The petitioner is sister-in-law of the complainant and she is married and relative of husband of the complainant and is living separately at Bemetara. She is also working woman and posted as Teacher at Government School. The incident took place at Ama Naka Raipur. The main allegation against the husband, mother-in-law and father-in-law. Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that the criminal Courts while proceeding against relatives of victim's husband should be careful in proceeding against distant relatives in crime pertaining to matrimonial disputes and dowry and relatives of husband should not be roped in on the basis of omnibus allegations, unless specific instances of their involvement in offences are made out.

9. In view of above, so far as the petitioner is concerned, criminal proceeding in criminal case No. 10314/2021 pending before the Court of JMFC Raipur only against the present petitioner namely Deepmala Sahu is set aside/quashed.

10. Accordingly, the present petition deserves to be and is hereby allowed and disposed of.

11. Office is directed to send a certified copy of this order to the concerned Court for necessary information and its compliance.

Rajesh.C vs State Of Kerala,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/71779122/,"Kerala High Court
Rajesh.C vs State Of Kerala on 6 January, 2025
Dated, this the 06th day of January, 2025 B.S.Joshi and Others v. State of Haryana and another [(2003) 4 SCC 675] held that the offence under Section 498A can be quashed by the High Court exercising its inherent power under Section 482 Cr.P.C (now Section 528 of BNSS, 2023), though such offence is not compoundable under Section 320. Relying on State of Karnataka v. L. Muniswamy [(1977) 2 SCC 699], a two Judges Bench in B.S. Joshi (Supra) held that ends of justice are higher than ends of mere law, though justice has got to be administered according to laws made by legislature. The fact that there is no reasonable likelihood of conviction, in the wake of settlement between the parties, was taken stock of. The following findings in B.S.Joshi (supra) are relevant and extracted here below:

""What would happen to the trial of the case where the wife does not support the imputations made in the FIR of the type in question. As earlier noticed, now she has filed an affidavit that the FIR was registered at her instance due to 2025:KER:292 temperamental differences and implied imputations. There may be many reasons for not supporting the imputations. It may be either for the reason that she has resolved disputes with her husband and his other family members and as a result thereof she has again started living with her husband, with whom she earlier had differences or she has willingly parted company and is living happily on her own or has married someone else on the earlier marriage having been dissolved by divorce on consent of parties or fails to support the prosecution on some other similar grounds. In such eventuality, there would almost be no chance of conviction. Would it then be proper to decline to exercise power of quashing on the ground that it would be permitting the parties to compound non- compoundable offences? The answer clearly has to be in the ""negative"". It would, however, be a different matter if the High Court on facts declines the prayer for quashing for any valid reasons including lack of bona fides.""
2. The dictum laid down in B.S.Joshi (supra) was doubted along with that laid down in other cases and referred to and considered by a three Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303]. B.S.Joshi (supra), along with other cases, were confirmed by the Supreme Court. It is relevant to note that 2025:KER:292 the subject matter in B.S.Joshi (supra) was specifically with reference to the offences under Section 498A and 406 of the Indian Penal Code.


3. In the facts at hand, petitioner is the 1 st accused in Crime No.1275/2009 of Aluva East Police Station, Ernakulam, now pending as C.C.No.172/2014 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Aluva. As per the final report, the offences alleged are under Section 498A and 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The petitioner seeks quashment of entire proceedings in the above Calendar Case, on the strength of the settlement arrived at by and between the parties.

4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, learned counsel for the 2nd respondent/defacto complainant and the learned Senior Public Prosecutor. Perused the records.

5. When this Crl.M.C was moved, this Court directed to record the statement of the defacto complainant. The said direction was complied and the statement was handed over. On perusal of the same, it is clear that the issues between the petitioner and the defacto complainant are settled in 2025:KER:292 Court mediation and the entire amount stipulated in the mediaiton agreement has been fully disbursed. The defacto complainant has no objection in quashing the criminal proceedings against the petitioner. That apart, it is noticed that along with this Crl.M.C., an affidavit has been sworn to by the defacto complainant (2 nd respondent herein) as Annexure 9, wherein she would unequivocally state that the disputes have been settled in mediation and that Rs.6,00,000/- stipulated in the agreement has been given. The defacto complainant would also swear that she has no surviving grievance against the petitioner and that the affidavit is sworn to on her own volition, without any compulsion, whatsoever. Learned Counsel for the 2 nd respondent would endorse that the quashment sought for can be allowed.


6. In the light of the above referred facts, this Court is of the opinion that the necessary parameters, as culled out in B.S.Joshi (supra) and Gian Singh (Supra), are fully satisfied. This Court is convinced that further proceedings against the petitioner will be a futile exercise, inasmuch 2025:KER:292 as the disputes have already been settled. There is little possibility of any conviction in the crime. Dehors the settlement arrived at by and between the parties, if they are compelled to face the criminal proceedings, the same, in the estimation of this Court, will amount to abuse of process of Court. The quashment sought for would secure the ends of justice.

In the circumstances, this Crl.M.C. is allowed. Annexure 4 FIR in Crime No.1275/2009, Annexure 5 Final Report and all further proceedings in C.C.No.172/2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Aluva are hereby quashed.

Ponnazhagu vs The State Represented By Sub Inspector ... on 9 January, 2025
1. This Criminal Revision Case has been filed, against the judgement of conviction and sentence, dated 21.10.2021, passed in CA.No.19 of 2016, by the Additional District Judge (FTMC), Mayiladudurai, confirming the judgement of conviction and sentence, dated 13.10.2016, passed in CC.No.137 of 2004, by the Judicial Magistrate, Sirkazhi, thereby convicting and sentencing the Revision Petitioner /A1, Ponnazhagu for the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis offences under Section 498A of IPC to undergo six months Rigorous Imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/-, in default to undergo one month imprisonment and acquitting him from the offences under Sections 506(ii) read with 34 of IPC and Sections 4 and 6 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.

2. The case of the Prosecution, arisen on the basis of the complaint, Ex.P1, First Information Report, given by the complainant, PW.1, Nagajayam, W/o.Ponnazhagu, against four persons, namely, (1) Ponnazhagu Perumal, (2) Maheswari Kannaiyan, (3) Padmavathy Kanniyan and (4) Kannaiyan Perumal, who were arrayed as A1, A2, A3 and A4, registered in Crime No.12 of 2003 at the All Women Police Station, Sirkazhi, on 08.10.2003, for the offences punishable under Sections 498A and 506(ii) read with 34 of IPC and Sections 4 and 6 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, is as follows:-

(a) The Revision Petitioner/A1 is the husband of the complainant, PW.1. A2 is the daughter of sister of A1. A3 is the sister of A1 and A4 is the husband of A3. The marriage between PW.1 and the Revision Petitioner, namely, Ponnazhugu was solemnized on 14.07.2002. At the time of marriage, 50 sovereigns of gold ornaments, house hold articles worth about Rs.1,50,000/-, a sum of Rs.50,000/- by way of cash for purchase of two wheeler and another sum of Rs.1,00,000/- in cash were given to the Revision Petitioner.
(b) Within three months from the date of the marriage, dispute arose between them. The Revision Petitioner/A1 used to threaten and torture https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis her to sign in blank papers, by saying that he is going to marry A2, as a second wife. In a Panchayat held on 13.04.2003 convened and presided by the President of Melaiyur Panchayat, the Revision Petitioner/A1 said that he would live with her peacefully. After the Panchayat, they were living peacefully for three months. On 23.09.2003 at 8.00 p.m. in the house of A1, all the accused have threatened her not to interfere with the second marriage of A1 with A2, failing which, they threatened to kill her by pouring kerosene on her. All the accused again demanded a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- to perform the marriage of A2, if PW.1 was not willing to give consent for the second marriage.
(c) On 27.09.2003 at 6.00 a.m., the Revision Petitioner again demanded a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- from the brother of PW.1, Bairavanathan and her elder brother's son, when they came to meet him. Thereafter, again all the accused demanded a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- from PW.1 to continue the matrimonial life with the Revision Petitioner/A1. Since she refused to pay the amount, A2 to A4 started to torture her. PW.1 was driven out of the matrimonial home and she was living in her mother's house.
(d) Hence, for such acts, the Respondent Police, after conducting investigation, had filed a charge sheet against the accused/A1 to A4 for the offences under Sections 498A and 506(ii) of IPC read with 34 and 4 and 6 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, before the Judicial Magistrate, Sirkazhi.
3. The case was taken on file in CC.No.137 of 2004 by the Judicial https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Magistrate, Sirkazhi. After receipt of summons from the Trial Court, when the accused appeared in person before the Trial Court, copies of the documents were served on them under Section 207 of Cr.PC. After giving sufficient time to the accused and after hearing the accused and considering the documents, necessary charges were framed for the offences under Sections 498A and 506(ii) read with 34 of IPC and Sections 4 and 6 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. Since the accused had denied the charges and pleaded not guilty of the aforeaid charges and claimed to be tried, in order to bring home the charges against the accused, the Prosecution examined the following 11 witnesses, as PW.1 to PW.11 and marked 5 documents as Ex.P1 to Ex.P5.

1. PW.1 = Nagajeyan (Complainant)

2. PW.2 = Ganapathi Thevar

3. PW.3 = Bairavanathan

4. PW.4 = Veeraiyan

5. PW.5 = Manickavasagam

6. PW.6 = Nithyanandam

7. PW.7 = Vellaiyan

8. PW.8 = Maruthavanan

9. PW.9 = A.K.Murthy

10. PW.10 = Mullaikodi

11. PW.11 = Lakshmi Prabha, Sub Inspector of Police

1. Ex.P1 = Complaint given by PW.1

2. Ex.P2 = Resolution passed in the Panchayat held on 13.04.2003

3. Ex.P3 = Observation Mahazar

4. Ex.P4 = First Information Report in Cr.No.12 of 2003

5. Ex.P5 = Rough Sketch

4. On completion of the evidence on the side of the Prosecution, when the accused were questioned under Section 313 of Cr.PC, as to the incriminating circumstances found in the evidence of prosecution https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis witnesses against them, the accused had come with the version of total denial and stated that they had been falsely implicated in this case. On the side the accused, neither any witness was examined nor any document was marked.

5. The Trial Court, after hearing the arguments advanced on either side and also looking into the materials available on record, found the Revision Petitioner/A1 guilty and awarded punishments, as referred to above and acquitted A2 to A4 from all the charges levelled against them, by the impugned judgement of conviction and sentence. On the appeal, the lower appellate court had, by its impugned judgement of conviction and sentence, confirmed the judgement of conviction and sentence of the Trial Court. Aggrieved over the same, this Criminal Revision Case has been filed by the Revision Petitioner/A1.

6. This Court heard Mr.R.Shanmugasundaram, the learned senior counsel for the Revision Petitioner, assisted by Ms.A.G.Shakeena and Mr.A.Gopinath, the learned Government Advocate (Criminal Side) for the Respondent. Translated copies of the judgements and the other connected documents were supplied by learned counsel for the parties in the Court for consideration.

7. The learned senior counsel for the Revision Petitioner has submitted that the trial courts have not appreciated the facts and evidence in a proper and perspective manner and that though there is no valid, reliable and cogent evidence, both oral and documentary evidence, to base conviction https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis on the Revision Petitioner/A1 for the offence under Section 498A of IPC, the trial courts erred in convicting the Revision Petitioner/A1 only based on the evidence of the interested witnesses, who are only hearsay witnesses.

8. The learned senior counsel for the Revision Petitioner has further submitted that the impugned judgements of conviction and sentence of the trial courts are not sustainable on the following material contradictions, infirmities and discrepancies found in the case of the Prosecution:-

a) After the conciliation meeting in the Panchayat, PW.1 and the Revision Petitioner/A1 were living together in the matrimonial home peacefully and when PW.1 became three months pregnant, she went to her mother's house on her own. There is no presumption clause for an offence under Section 498A of IPC and the Prosecution has to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubt, by letting in valid and cogent evidence. However, the trial courts, presuming that if the Revision Petitioner/A1 really did not commit any cruelty or harassment on PW.1, why he did not go to bring PW.1 back to his house, erroneously held that the offence of 498A of IPC is made out against him.
b) As per the oral evidence of PW.1, it is only A3 and A4, who demanded the alleged sum that too only to perform the marriage of A2. PW.1 has not stated anything about any demand of the alleged amount on the part of the Revision Petitioner/A1. Hence, on this ground also, the trial courts, while acquitting A3 and A4 from the charges under Section 498A of IPC, ought to have acquitted the Revision Petitioner/A1 also for the said https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis charges under Section 498A of IPC, as the allegation is not proved against the Revision Petitioner/A1.
c) When the other co-accused, namely, A2 to A4, along with the Revision Petitioner/A1 were tried for the same set of similar and identical charges and when there are similar and identical evidence for all the accused, acquitting A2 to A4 alone from the same set of similar and identical evidence from all the charges would amount to discrimination, that too when there is no concrete evidence against the Revision Petitioner/A1.
Hence, the trial courts ought to have acquitted the Revision Petitioner/A1 also on the same set of similar and identical evidence.

d) All the Prosecution witnesses, namely, PW.1 to PW.5, who are relatives and PW.6 to PW.10 are not the direct eye witnesses and they are only hearsay witnesses. The evidence of PW.1 has not been corroborated by any other Prosecution witnesses. As per the evidence of PW.1, her father, mother and brothers have no personal or direct knowledge about any cruelty caused to her by the Revision Petitioner/A1 and only they came to know about the cruelty only on the information given by PW.1 and as such, the evidence of all the Prosecution witnesses are only hearsay evidence and hence, it cannot be taken into consideration. However, the trial courts erred in relying on the evidence of such hearsay witnesses to base conviction on the Revision Petitioner/A1 for the offence under Section 498A of IPC.

e) Though it is alleged that the demand of the amount was made on https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 23.09.2003 and 27.09.2003, the complaint was made only on 07.10.2003. Though it is alleged that the accused committed cruelty on those dates, there is no immediate complaint or at least on the next day of such alleged occurrence and hence, the alleged demand of the amount and cruelty meted out to PW.1 by the Revision Petitioner/A1 becomes doubtful.

f) As per the evidence of PW.2, father of the PW.1, there was an earlier complaint given by PW.1 on 04.10.2003 and it has been suppressed.

g) PW.3, brother of PW.1, in his evidence, has stated that after lodging the complaint to the Police on 07.10.2003, PW.1 came to her own Village, but whereas PW.1 in her cross examination has deposed that after lodging of the complaint on 07.10.2003, PW.2, father of PW.1 stayed with her in the matrimonial house for 4 or 5 days. Hence, the evidence of PW.1 and PW.3 are contradictory with each other and cannot be relied upon.

h) The alleged demand of money on 23.09.2003 and 27.09.2003 for the marriage of A2 would not amount to unlawful demand and to cruelty.

i) As per the evidence of PW.11, the Investigating Officer, Ex.P1, First Information Report was said to have been registered on 08.10.2003 and PW.11 had arrested two accused on 07.10.2003, which is prior to registration of Ex.P1. Though the neighbours of the Revision Petitioner/ A1 knew about the cruelty caused to PW.1, PW.11 did not examine any of such neighbours or Villagers, but only the relatives and interested https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis witnesses of PW.1. Hence, the investigation had not been done in a fair manner.

j) Since the Revision Petitioner was a Government Servant, he could not have any intention for the second marriage, even with the consent of PW.1, since the allegation of second marriage will be against the Tamil Nadu Government Servants Conduct Rules, warranting disciplinary action under the Tamil Nadu Civil Services (D&A) Rules.

9. The learned senior counsel for the Revision Petitioner has ultimately submitted that in view of the above said grounds, the case of the Prosecution appears to be wholly unreliable and that the Prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case beyond the realm of reasonable doubts and that in view of the above said discrepancies, infirmities and material contradictions in the evidence of the Prosecution and in the absence of valid, convincing and cogent evidence against the Revision Petitioner/A1 for the offence under Section 498A of IPC, the impugned judgements of conviction and sentence are not sustainable.

10. In support of his contentions, the learned senior counsel for the Revision Petitioner/A1 has relied on the following decisions:-

a) 2023 9 SCC 164 (Javed Shaukat Ali Qureshi Vs. State of Gujarat)
b) 2024 4 SCC 208 (Ram Singh Vs. State of UP)
c) 2024 SCC Online SC 2609 (Yogarani Vs. State)
d) 2024 SCC Online SC 3682 (Dara Lakshmi Narayana and others Vs. State of Telungana)
11. Per contra, the learned Government Advocate (Criminal Side) for the Respondent has, while supporting the impugned judgements of conviction https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and sentence of the trial courts, submitted that the Prosecution has proved its case beyond all reasonable doubts, by letting in valid and cogent evidence and that though the Prosecution witnesses are interested witnesses, their evidence is sufficient to base conviction on the Revision Petitioner/A1 for the offence under Section 498A of IPC and that therefore, the impugned judgements of conviction and sentence need not be interfered with.

12. I have given my careful and anxious consideration to the rival contentions put forward by the learned counsel on either side and thoroughly scanned through the entire evidence available on record and also perused the impugned judgements of conviction and sentence, including the various decisions referred to by the learned counsel for the parties.

13. In the present case, there are four accused persons, namely, A1 to A4.

The Revision Petitioner herein is A1. The case of the Prosecution mainly rests on the evidence of PW.1 to PW.5.

14. PW.1, Complainant, is the wife of the Revision Petitioner/ A1. A2 is the daughter of sister of A1. A3 is the sister of A1 and A4 is the husband of A3.

15. PW.2 is the father of PW.1. PW.3 is the brother of PW.1. PW.4 and PW.5 are the relatives of PW.1. PW.6 is a participant of the Panchayat. PW.7 is the President of the Panchayat concerned. PW.8 and PW.9 are the Panchayatars. PW.10 is a witness to the charge sheet. PW.11 is the Investigating Officer.

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

16. The charges against A1 to A4 are under Sections 498A and 506(ii) read with Section 34 of IPC and Sections 4 and 6 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. A2 to A4 stood acquitted of all the charges by the trial courts. Both the trial courts convicted and sentenced the Revision Petitioner/A1 alone for the offence under Section 498A of IPC, while acquitting him from the other charges, as stated above.

17. Now, the question is whether the impugned judgements of conviction and sentence of the trial courts, convicting and sentencing the Revision Petitioner/A1 alone under Section 498A of IPC are justifiable or not?

18. In the present case, in order to come to a conclusion as to whether the Prosecution has proved its case against the Revision Petitioner/A1 under the provisions of Section 498A of IPC by valid and cogent evidence and whether the trial courts are right in coming to the conclusion that the Revision Petitioner/A1 is guilty of the offence under Section 498A of IPC, it has become necessary for this Court to analyse the entire evidence, both oral and documentary evidence, in a proper and perspective manner.

19. Sections 498A of IPC reads as under:-

“498A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty.—Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.
Explanation.— For the purpose of this section, “cruelty” means—
(a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
(b)harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.
20. It is also pertinent to state that in order to attract the provisions of Section 498A of IPC, the Prosecution has to prove the essential ingredients of Section 498A of IPC, by letting in valid and cogent evidence that the cruelty or harassment meted out to the wife by her husband or relatives of her husband should be to the extent that it became unbearable and that cruelty must be of the nature of harassment of such woman, with a view to coerce her to meet unlawful demand for property or valuable security.

21. As contended by the learned senior counsel for the Revision Petitioner, there is no presumption under Section 498A of IPC. It is seen from the evidence that after the conciliation meeting in the Panchayat, PW.1 and the Revision Petitioner/A1 were living together in the matrimonial home peacefully and when PW.1 became three months pregnant, she went to her mother's house on her own. The only ground, on which the trial courts convicted and sentenced the Revision Petitioner/A1, is presumption of 498A of IPC, thereby meaning that there is no convincing and cogent evidence, against the Revision Petitioner/A1 for the offence under Section 498A of IPC. As stated above, there is no presumption clause for an offence punishable under Section 498A of IPC. The Prosecution has to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubts, by letting in valid and cogent evidence and not by presumptions and assumptions. However, the trial https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis courts have erroneously presuming that if the Revision Petitioner/A1 really did not cause any harassment or cruelty on PW.1, PW.1 would have returned to the matrimonial home and no reason was adduced as to why A1 did not go to bring PW.1 back to his house, held that the offence of 498A of IPC is made out against the Revision Petitioner/A1, which is not justifiable.

22. Further, as regards the other infirmities and the discrepancies in the case of the Prosecution, as contended by the learned senior counsel for the Revision Petitioner, it is seen that the case of the Prosecution is that the money was demanded by the Revision Petitioner/A1 to continue the matrimonial life with PW.1, thereby causing cruelty on PW.1. But, it is seen from the entire evidence, particularly, the oral evidence of PW.1, it is seen that nowhere, the Revision Petitioner/A1 demanded money and threatened and tortured PW.1. It is only A3 and A4, who demanded the alleged sum that too only to perform the marriage of A2 with someone else and threatened and caused mental cruelty to PW.1, by saying that if PW.1 did not give the money, they would kill her by pouring kerosene on her. In her evidence, PW.1 has not stated anything about any demand of the alleged amount on the part of he Revision Petitioner/A1 or he caused cruelty on her. Thus, the oral evidence of PW.1 and other Prosecution witnesses and the case of the Prosecution are totally contradictory with each other. Hence, the trial courts, while acquitting A2 to A4 on such evidence, ought to have acquitted the Revision Petitioner/A1 also for the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis said charges, but the trial courts erroneously convicted the Revision Petitioner/A1 under Section 498A of IPC, which is illegal.

23. It is seen from the records that in this case, the other co-accused, namely, A2 to A4, along with the Revision Petitioner/A1 were tried for the same set of similar and identical charges, namely, offences under Sections 498A, 506(ii) read with 34 of IPC and Section 4 and 6 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. The other co-accused, namely, A2 to A4 were acquitted from all the charges levelled against them, on the same set of similar and identical evidence and that the Revision Petitioner/A1 alone was convicted for the offence under Section 498A of IPC and acquitted from the other charges, on the same and identical evidence. Hence, this Court is of the view that acquitting the other co-accused and convicting the Revision Petitioner/A1 alone on the same set of similar and identical evidence would amount to disparity and discrimination. Hence, on this ground alone, the trial courts ought to have acquitted the Revision Petitioner/A1 for the offence under Section 498A of IPC and accordingly, the impugned judgements of conviction and sentence of the trial courts are not sustainable.

24. The Honourable Supreme Court, in the case of Javed Shaukat Ali Qureshi Vs. State of Gujarat; 2023 9 SCC 164, which was relied on by the Honourable Supreme Court in its subsequent decisions reported in the case of Ram Singh Vs. State of UP; 2024 4 SCC 208 and Yogarani Vs. State; 2024 SCC Online SC 2609, was pleased to observe as under:-

“15. When there is similar or identical evidence of eyewitnesses https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis against two accused by ascribing them the same or similar role, the court cannot convict one accused and acquit the other. In such a case, the cases of both the accused will be governed by the principle of parity. This principle means that the criminal court should decide like cases alike and in such cases, the Court cannot make a distinction between the two accused, which will amount to discrimination.”
25. Insofar as the ground of hearsay evidence is concerned, as stated above, the trial courts mainly relied on the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses, namely, PW.2 to PW.5, who are the relatives of PW.1. PW.2 is the father of PW.1. PW.3 is the brother of PW.1. PW.4 and PW.5 are the relatives of PW.1. PW.6 is a participant of the Panchayat. PW.7 is the President of the Panchayat concerned. PW.8 and PW.9 are the Panchayatars. PW.10 is a witness to the charge sheet. PW.11 is the Investigating Officer.

26. PW.1 has stated in her cross examination that her father, mother and brother did not know directly about the alleged acts of cruelty and demand, on the part of the Revision Petitioner/A1 and that only on her information, they came to know about the same.

27. It is established from the above evidence of PW.1 that her father (PW.2), mother and brother (PW.3) have no personal knowledge about any cruelty caused to her by the Revision Petitioner/A1 and only they came to know about the cruelty only on the information given by PW.1. Thus, as stated above, all the Prosecution witnesses are not the direct eye witnesses to the alleged demand of money and cruelty and they are only hearsay witnesses and interested witnesses. Hence, it is unsafe to rely solely on the deposition of PW.1 alone and in the absence of sufficient corroboration https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis to the evidence of PW.1, to base conviction on the Revision Petitioner/A1. However, the trial courts grossly erred in considering the hearsay evidences to base conviction on the Revision Petitioner/A1 under Section 498A of IPC, by the impugned judgements of conviction and sentence, which are unsustainable.

28. Witnesses may be categorized into three distinct categories. They may be wholly reliable. Similarly there may be witnesses, who can be considered wholly unreliable. There is no difficulty in placing reliance or disbelieving his evidence when an evidence is wholly reliable or wholly un-reliable, but difficulty arises in case of third category i.e. where witness is neither wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable. Hostile witness ordinarily falls in category of those witnesses who are neither wholly reliable nor wholly un-reliable. The Honourable Supreme Court, in Khujji @ Surendra Tiwari Vs. State of M.P; AIR 1991 SC page 1853, was pleased to observe as under:-

""The evidence of a prosecution witness cannot be rejected in toto merely because the prosecution chose to treat him as hostile and cross-examined him. The evidence of such witnesses cannot be treated as effaced or washed off the record altogether, but the same can be accepted to the extent their version is found to be dependable on a careful scrutiny thereof.""
29. The term ""hostile witness"" does not find a place in the Evidence Act 1872 (herein after referred to as the Act of 1872 for brevity). It is a term borrowed from the English Law. Though in the English Law to allow a party to contradict its own witness was not acceptable view. The theory of contradicting its own witness was resisted on the ground that party should be permitted to discard or contradict his own witness, which turns https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis unfavorable to the party calling him, however, this rigidity of rule was sought to be relaxed by evolving a term ""hostile"" or ""unfavourable witness""

in common law.
30. It is relevant to quote Section 154 (1) of the Act of 1872, as under:-

“""the Court may, in its discretion, permit the person, who calls a witness to put any question to him, which might be put in cross examination by the adverse party"".
31. Sub-Section (2) of Section 154 of Act of 1872, further provides as under:-

""Nothing in this section shall disentitle the person so permitted under sub-section (1), to rely on any part of evidence of such witness"".
32. Thus, discretion is vested in Court to permit a person to put such question, which may be put by an adverse party, if Court deems it appropriate. Thus, the term ""hostile witness"" has been borrowed from the English Law and developed in through case Laws.

33. The principle of ""falsus in uno falsus in omnibus"" (false in one thing, false in everything) has no application in India. It is the duty of the Court to separate grain from chaff. Keeping in view the above principles, the Honourable Supreme Court, in the case of Sucha Singh v. State of Punjab; AIR 2003 SC 3617, was pleased to observe as under :-

""even if major portion of the evidence is found to be deficient, in case residue is sufficient to prove guilt of an accused, it is the duty of the court to separate grain from chaff. Falsity of particular material witness or material particular would not ruin it from the beginning to end. The maxim falsus in uno falsus in omnibus (false in one thing, false in everything) has no application in India and the witness cannot be branded as a liar. In case this maxim is applied in all the cases it is to be feared that administration of criminal justice would come to a dead stop. Witnesses just cannot help in giving embroidery to a story, however, truth is the main. Therefore, it has to be appraised in each case as to what extent the evidence is worthy of credence, and merely because in some respects the court https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis considers the same to be insufficient or unworthy of reliance, it does not necessarily follow as a matter of law that it must be disregarded in all respects as well.""
34. Though the alleged demand of the amount was made on 23.09.2003 and 27.09.2003, the complaint was made only on 07.10.2003. Though it is alleged that the accused committed cruelty on those dates, there is no immediate complaint or at least on the next day of such alleged occurrence and hence, the alleged demand of the amount and cruelty meted out to PW.1 by the Revision Petitioner/A1 become doubtful.

35. As per the evidence of PW.2, father of the PW.1, there was an earlier complaint given by PW.1 on 04.10.2003 and it has been suppressed and it is not known as to what had happened after that complaint and nothing has been stated further by PW.1 in this regard.

36. Another glaring infirmity in the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses, brought to the notice of this Court by the learned senior counsel for the Revision Petitioner/A1, regarding the whereabouts of PW.1 after lodging the complaint on 07.10.2003, is the material contradiction in the evidence of PW.1 and PW.3, namely, PW.3, brother of PW.1, in his evidence, has stated that after lodging the complaint to the Police on 07.10.2003, PW.1 came to her own Village, but whereas PW.1 in her cross examination has deposed that after lodging the complaint on 07.10.2003, PW.2, father of PW.1 stayed with her in the matrimonial house for about 4 or 5 days. Thus, the evidence of PW.1 and PW.3 are contradictory with each other. Even PW.1 contradicts her own evidence, which also creates doubt on the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Prosecution's case.

37. Even assuming that there was an alleged demand of money on 23.09.2003 and 27.09.2003 by A3 and A4 for the marriage of A2, that would not amount to unlawful demand and to cruelty or harassment. In this regard, the evidence is completely lacking that for that demand, the ill treatment was made to PW.1 by the Revision Petitioner/A1.

38. As per the evidence of PW.11, Investigating Officer, Ex.P1, First Information Report was said to have been registered on 08.10.2003 and PW.11 had arrested two accused on 07.10.2003, which is prior to registration of Ex.P1. Though it is stated by PW.11 in her deposition that the neighbours of the Revision Petitioner/A1 knew about the cruelty caused to PW.1, PW.11 did not examine any of such neighbours or Villagers, but only the relatives and interested witnesses of PW.1. Hence, this Court is of the view that the investigation had not been done in a fair manner and that non-examination of the neighbours of the Revision Petitioner/A1, who are the proper persons to speak about the alleged acts, would be fatal to the case of the Prosecution.

39. Since the Revision Petitioner was a Government Servant, he could not most probably have any intention for the second marriage, even with the consent of PW.1, since the allegation of second marriage will be against the Tamil Nadu Government Servants Conduct Rules, warranting disciplinary action under the Tamil Nadu Civil Services (D&A) Rules. If such being the case, PW.1 would have definitely made a complaint to the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Employer of the Revision Petitioner/A1, but, it is not done so in this case. Hence, the case of PW.1 becomes unreliable.

40. At this juncture, this Court is of the view that through out the web of the Criminal Jurisprudence, one golden thread is always seen that it is the duty of the Prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubts, by letting in valid, convincing and cogent evidence. This burden of proof on the Prosecution to prove guilt is also known as presumption of innocence. The presumption of innocence, some times refer to by the latin expression “ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat” (the burden of proof is on one who declares, not to one who denies) is the principle that one is considered innocence unless proven guilt. In criminal jurisprudence, every accused is presumed to be innocent unless the guilt is proved. The presumption of innocence is a human right. The Prosecution may obtain a criminal conviction only when the evidence proves the guilt of accused beyond reasonable doubt.

41. The Honourable Supreme Court, in the case of Dara Lakshmi Narayana and others Vs. State of Telungana; 2024 SCC Online SC 3682, was pleased to observe as under:-

“28. The inclusion of Section 498A of the IPC by way of an amendment was intended to curb cruelty inflicted on a woman by her husband and his family, ensuring swift intervention by the State. However, in recent years, as there have been a notable rise in matrimonial disputes across the country, accompanied by growing discord and tension within the institution of marriage, consequently, there has been a growing tendency to misuse provisions like Section https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 498A of the IPC as a tool for unleashing personal vendetta against the husband and his family by a wife. Making vague and generalised allegations during matrimonial conflicts, if not scrutinized, will lead to the misuse of legal processes and an encouragement for use of arm twisting tactics by a wife and/or her family. Sometimes, recourse is taken to invoke Section 498A of the IPC against the husband and his family in order to seek compliance with the unreasonable demands of a wife. Consequently, this Court has, time and again, cautioned against prosecuting the husband and his family in the absence of a clear prima facie case against them.”
42. It is not the intention of the legislature that any women, who has suffered cruelty in terms of what has been contemplated under Section 498A of IPC, should remain silent and forbear herself from making a complaint or initiating criminal proceedings. In fact, insertion of the said provision is meant mainly for the protection of a woman, who is subjected to cruelty in the matrimonial home primarily due to unlawful demand for any property or valuable property. However, in the present case, this Court is of the view that it has been misused, in the absence of a clear prima facie case being made out against the Revision Petitioner/A1 under Section 498A of IPC, as discussed above.

43. In sum and substance, in the present case, this Court is of the view that surmises and conjectures or presumptions and assumptions would not take the place of proof. Further, the learned Government Advocate for the Respondent has not been able to point out any evidence on record to prove the charges under Section 498A of IPC against the Revision Petitioner/A1. In other words, exfacie no case has been made out under Section 498A of IPC against the Revision Petitioner/A1. There is absolutely no evidence to show any harassment or cruelty meted out to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis PW.1 by the Revision Petitioner/A1. The evidence of PW.1 is unreliable. As stated above, there is a disparity between the charges framed and the evidence of PW.1, which is also contradictory to the evidence of the other Prosecution witnesses, which has caused prejudice to the Revision Petitioner/A1. When the trial courts acquitted A2 to A4 from the offence under Section 498A of IPC on the same set of similar and identical evidence, they committed a grave error in convicting the Revision Petitioner/A1 alone on the same set of similar and identical evidence under Section 498A of IPC.

44. The Honourable Supreme Court, in the case of Vadivelu Thevar v. State of Madras; 1957 SCR 981: AIR 1957 SC 614, was pleased to observe at para 11 & 12 as under:-

""11...........it is a sound and well-established rule of law that the court is concerned with the quality and not with the quantity of the evidence necessary for proving or disproving a fact. Generally speaking, oral testimony in this context may be classified into three categories, namely:
(1) Wholly reliable, (2) Wholly unreliable (3) Neither wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable.
12. In the first category of proof the court should have no difficulty in coming to its conclusion either way it may convict or may acquit on the testimony of a single witness if it is found to be above reproach or suspicion of interestedness, incompetence, or subornation. In the second category the court equally has no difficulty to its conclusion. It is in the third category of cases that the court has to be circumspect and has to look for corroboration in the material particulars by reliable testimony direct or circumstantial.........""

45. In the present case, after a careful perusal of all the testimonies of the Prosecution witnesses as well as the defence witnesses, this Court finds https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis that the trial courts had failed to circumspect the material on record carefully.

46. Further, a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court, in the case of Suresh Narain Tripathi and others Vs. State of UP and Others; 2005 Cril LJ 2479, granted acquittal for the offence under Section 436 of IPC, where the star witnesses were unreliable and was pleased to observe at para 13 as under:-

""13. Certainly, it is the primary principle that the accused must be and not merely may be guilty before a court can convict and a mental distinction between 'may be' and 'must be' is long and divided vague conjectures from sure conclusions.""
47. It feels pain to observe that in our present system of trial despite having sufficient power to the Judge to ask questions to the witnesses in order to find out truth, most of them do not ask questions to the witnesses to shift the grain from the chaff. Practice of leaving witnesses to the Advocates, when a witness becomes hostile, is not un-common in the trial courts. Time and again the Honourable Supreme Court has reminded that a Judge does not preside over a criminal trial merely to see that no innocent man is punished, but a Judge also presides to see that a guilty man does not escape. Both are public duties, which the Judge has to perform. Therefore, the trial Court must shed their inertia and must intervene in all those cases where intervention is necessary for the ends of justice.

48. In the present case, in the absence of any concrete and convincing evidence to show that PW.1 was subjected to cruelty or she was put to harassment or torture either mentally or physically, this Court is of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis view that no offence under Section 498A of IPC has been proved against the Revision Petitioner/A1. Therefore, it is difficult to sustain the impugned conviction and sentence imposed on the Revision Petitioner/A1 under Section 498A of IPC merely on the unreliable testimony of the Prosecution witnesses, whose evidence is not worthy of credence, as they are hearsay witnesses. Hence, the impugned judgements of conviction and sentence recorded by the trial courts under Section 498A of IPC against the Revision Petitioner/A1 cannot be sustained and accordingly, are liable to be set aside.

49. In the result, in the light of the above said observations and the decisions of the Honourable Supreme Court and after analysis of the circumstances of the present case in the light of the aforesaid settled legal principles and in view of the above said infirmities, discrepancies and material contradictions in the case of the Prosecution, as discussed above, this Criminal Revision Case is allowed. In respect of the Revision Petitioner, Ponnazhagu alone and insofar as the imposition of conviction and sentence under Section 498A of IPC on the Revision Petitioner, Ponnazhagu alone is concerned, the impugned judgements of conviction and sentence, dated 21.10.2021 passed in CA.No.19 of 2016, by the Additional District Judge (FTMC), Mayiladudurai and dated 13.10.2016, passed in CC.No.137 of 2004 by the Judicial Magistrate, Sirkazhi are set aside and reversed. The Revision Petitioner, Ponnazhagu, is acquitted of all the charges levelled against him. The personal bonds and surety https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis bonds, if any executed by the Revision Petitioner, shall stand cancelled and the sureties are discharged. No order as to costs.

Anish Vettath vs State Of Kerala on 6 January, 2025
This Bail Application is filed under Section 482 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita.

2. Petitioners are accused in Crime No.565/2024 of Thiruvambadi Police Station. The above case is registered against the petitioners alleging offences punishable under Sections 406 and 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

3. The prosecution case is that, petitioners are the husband and in laws of the defacto complainant. It is alleged that the petitioners mentally and physically harassed the defacto complainant.

4. Heard counsel for the petitioners and the Public Prosecutor.

5. Admittedly, the marriage relationship between the petitioner and the defacto complainant is in 2025:KER:390 BAIL APPL. NO.10361 OF 2024 existence. The offence alleged are matrimonial in nature. It is also submitted that an application for custody of child is also pending before the Family Court. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, I think bail can be granted to the petitioners after imposing stringent conditions.

6. Moreover, it is a well accepted principle that the bail is the rule and the jail is the exception. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Chidambaram. P v Directorate of Enforcement [2019 (16) SCALE 870], after considering all the earlier judgments, observed that, the basic jurisprudence relating to bail remains the same inasmuch as the grant of bail is the rule and refusal is the exception so as to ensure that the accused has the opportunity of securing fair trial.

7. Recently the Apex Court in Siddharth v State of Uttar Pradesh and Another [2021(5)KHC 353] considered the point in detail. The relevant paragraph of the above judgment is extracted hereunder:

""12. We may note that personal liberty is an important aspect of our constitutional mandate.
2025:KER:390 BAIL APPL. NO.10361 OF 2024 The occasion to arrest an accused during investigation arises when custodial investigation becomes necessary or it is a heinous crime or where there is a possibility of influencing the witnesses or accused may abscond. Merely because an arrest can be made because it is lawful does not mandate that arrest must be made. A distinction must be made between the existence of the power to arrest and the justification for exercise of it. (Joginder Kumar v. State of UP and Others (1994 KHC 189: (1994) 4 SCC 260: 1994 (1) KLT 919: 1994 (2) KLJ 97:
AIR 1994 SC 1349: 1994 CriLJ 1981)) If arrest is made routine, it can cause incalculable harm to the reputation and self-esteem of a person. If the Investigating Officer has no reason to believe that the accused will abscond or disobey summons and has, in fact, throughout cooperated with the investigation we fail to appreciate why there should be a compulsion on the officer to arrest the accused.""
8. In Manish Sisodia v. Central Bureau of Investigation [2023 KHC 6961], the Apex Court observed that even if the allegation is one of grave economic offence, it is not a rule that bail should be denied in every case.

Considering the dictum laid down in the above decision and considering the facts and circumstances of this case, this Bail Application is allowed with the following directions:

2025:KER:390 BAIL APPL. NO.10361 OF 2024
1. The petitioners shall appear before the Investigating Officer within two weeks from today and shall undergo interrogation.
2. After interrogation, if the Investigating Officer propose to arrest the petitioners, they shall be released on bail on executing a bond for a sum of Rs.50,000/-(Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the arresting officer concerned.
3. The petitioners shall appear before the Investigating Officer for interrogation as and when required. The petitioners shall co-operate with the investigation and shall not, directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case 2025:KER:390 BAIL APPL. NO.10361 OF 2024 so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any police officer.
4. Petitioners shall not leave India without permission of the jurisdictional Court.
5. Petitioners shall not commit an offence similar to the offence of which they are accused, or suspected, of the commission of which they are suspected.
6. If the petitioners want to go abroad, the petitioners are free to file appropriate application before the Jurisdictional Court and Jurisdictional Court is free to pass orders in accordance with law.
6. If any of the above conditions are violated by the petitioners, the jurisdictional Court can cancel the bail in accordance to law, even though the bail is granted by this Court. The prosecution and the victim are at 2025:KER:390 BAIL APPL. NO.10361 OF 2024 liberty to approach the jurisdictional Court to cancel the bail, if any of the above conditions are violated.

                                                         JUDGMENT
Challenging the judgment of conviction and sentence imposed by the Mahalir Neethi Mandram (Mahila Court), Coimbatore in Sessions Case No.137 of 2014 dated 28.2.2019, the present Criminal Appeal has been filed by the accused.

2. The case of the prosecution, as evinced from the prosecution witnesses and the complaint lodged by the de facto complainant is as under:-

(i) The marriage between her daughter and the accused, who is the son of the cousin of her husband was conducted on 27.8.2010 at Bishop Ambrose Marriage Hall, Pothanur in the presence of elders belonging to both the families. She had come to know that her daughter Gayathri was in love with A1 Thirupathi and that both the families joined together performed the marriage. After the marriage, her daughter was living at Kasthuribai Nagar, Chettipalayam in her husband's house alongwith her father-in-law and mother-in-law.
(ii) During January 2011, the accused had sent her daughter for money to arrange for a nuclear family and she had given some money https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis at that time. Thereafter, they had sent their daughter during January 2012 asking for money to construct a house. PW1 had told her daughter that she would speak to her father.
(iii) Whileso, on 29.1.2012, at 4.30 pm, she had received an information that her daughter was lying dead in her home and that she had suspected that her delay in paying money would be the cause for the death. On the same day, at 11.55 pm, she had given a complaint, Ex.P1 to the respondent police.
(iv) Based on the complaint, PW21, Sub Inspector of Police, All Women Police Station, Perur registered a case in Crime No.4 of 2012 under Section 174 Cr.P.C. and prepared the First Information Report, Ex.P12 and forwarded copy of the FIR to PW16, the Revenue Divisional Officer, Coimbatore and another copy to PW22, the Deputy Inspector of Police/Investigating Officer and to other officials.
(v) On the same day,PW22, received the FIR and on the next day at 11.30 am, PW22 visited the scene of occurrence and prepared rough sketch Ex.P13 and observation mahazar Ex.P3 in the presence of witnesses Velliangiri and Ramachandran. On the same day, he had recovered M.O.1 nylon saree, which was hanging from the ceiling, M.O.2 Nokia black colour mobile phone and M.O.3 Airtel Sim Card under the recovery mahazar, Ex.P14. He had forwarded the same to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the court under Form 95, Ex.P15. On the same day, after the inequest was conducted by PW16, he had enquired the witnesses PWs.1, 2, 4, 10 and 11. Thereafter, on 31.1.2012, he had altered the FIR to one under Section 498A and 306 IPC. He, thereafter, sent the alteration report, Ex.P16 to the court. On the same day at 11.30 am, he arrested all the accused near Coimbatore Medical College Hospital.
The first accused, thereby had given a voluntary confession and it was recorded in the presence of PW19 and PW14. Thereafter, PW22 had gone to the scene of occurrence alongwith the accused and later took them to Pothanur All Women Police Station and after making entries in the police station, remanded the accused.

(vi) On 2.2.2012, PW22 had enquired P.Ws.3, and 5 and on 5.2.2012, he had enquired P.Ws.2, 9 and 17. Thereafter, he gave a request to the court to send the M.Os. for chemical analysis. Thereafter, on 19.2.2012, he had enquired PW13 and PW6 and recorded their statement. On 25.2.2012, he received files in respect of Petition No.28 of 2011 from Pothanur All Woman Police Station and thereafter, on 10.3.2012, conducted enquiry in respect of the petition and recorded the statement of PW20, Sub Inspector of Police and PW18 and PW7. On 23.3.2018, he examined PW16, the Revenue Divisional Officer and PW12, Dr.Jayasingh, President of Medico Legal https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Department, Coimbatore Medical College Hospital and recorded their statement and received the post mortem report Ex.P7 and thereafter, on 25.3.2012, he examined PW21, Sub Inspector of Police, PW8, photographer and thereafter, on completing the investigation, filed the charge sheet against the accused for offence punishable under Section 498A and 306 IPC read with Section 109 IPC before Judicial Magistrate V, Coimbatore on 7.6.2012.

(vii) The final report was taken in P.R.C.No.204 of 2012. Summons were issued to the accused on their appearance. The learned Judicial Magistrate furnished copies of the relevant documents to the accused under Section 207 Cr.P.C. and finding that the offences alleged are exclusively triable by the court of Sessions, had committed the accused to the Principal Sessions, Coimbatore.

(viii) The case was taken on file in S.C.No.137 of 2014 and was made over to the Mahalir Neethimandram, Coimbatore for trial.

(ix) On appearance of the accused and after hearing both sides, finding that prima facie case is made out, the Trial Court had framed the charges against A1 to A3 for offence punishable under Sections 498A IPC and as against A4 and A5 and for offence punishable under Section 498A read with 109 IPC and as against all the accused for offence punishable under Section 306 IPC. The charges were read https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis over and explained to the accused and when they were questioned, the accused pleaded not guilty and sought to be tried.

(x) In order to prove the case of the prosecution, the prosecution has examined P.Ws.1 to 22 and marked Exs.P1 to P16 and M.Os. 1 to 3. When the accused were questioned with regard to the incriminating circumstances against them under Section 313 Cr.P.C. they have denied the charges and when questioned, the accused had stated that they have got evidence in defence and on the side of the defence, the first examined himself as DW1 and one Dr.Mathumathi, Chief Medical Officer, Mathukkarai Government Hospital as DW2 and Dr.Kaleeswari, Medical Officer, Myleripalayam Primary Health Centre as DW3 and marked Exs.D1 to D3.

(xi) The Trial Court, after hearing the learned counsel for both sides, found A1 to A3 guilty for offence punishable under Section 498A IPC and A4 and A5 guilty for offence punishable under Section 498A read with 109 IPC and sentenced them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years and to pay a fine of Rs.5000/- in default to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months and acquitted the accused for offence punishable under Section 306 IPC. Aggrieved against the judgment of conviction and sentence, the Criminal Appeal has been filed by the accused.

3. The sum and substance of the submissions made by the learned counsel for the appellant is as under:-

(i) The Trial Court failed to take into consideration the exaggeration, contradictions and the embellishments in the evidence of the prosecution. Admittedly, the appellants and the family of the de facto complainant are relatives and the marriage was a love marriage with the concurrence of the members and elders of both families and there had been no demand of dowry at the time of marriage and after the marriage, the deceased and the first accused were living separately away from their in-laws. The victim was depressed for being unable to conceive and that the first appellant had been taking her for treatment for conception even as per the case of the prosecution. There was an earlier complaint dated 24.1.2011 on account of misunderstanding and difference of opinion within the family and thereby A1 and the victim had been living in a separate home and based on such complaint, enquiry was conducted and the victim herself had given a written reply Ex.P2 to All Women Police Station that there was difference of opinion between her and her husband and that her in-laws had agreed not to interfere in their problem and that she had also given an undertaking that she would not attempt to commit suicide in any circumstance. It would show https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis that the victim was sensitive for even small things and difference of opinion within a family on everyday mundane matters.
(ii) The case of the prosecution is that the accused had demanded Rs.2,00,000/- for repairing a house and that he had made the victim to do the household chores. The allegation of demanding of Rs.2,00,000/- is vague and bald and it is only an improvement made during the trial and the same is not reflected in the RDO Report, Ex.P10 dated 30.1.2012.

(iii) Even assuming the case of the prosecution without admitting, taken to be true that the victim had informed her mother that the first accused had asked her to give Rs.2,00,000/- for repairing the house, the demand of Rs.2,00,000/- for repairing a house would not fall within the meaning of 'dowry' or unlawful demand.

(iv) The prosecution has failed to prove cruelty within the meaning of of explanation (a) and (b) of Section 498A IPC. The normal wear and tear in a family life is not sufficient to bring the charge of Section 498A IPC and isolated incidents of misunderstanding is not sufficient to establish the charge of Section 498A IPC. Further, excepting the interested witnesses, no independent evidence has been let by the prosecution to prove the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis charges. When the prosecution has failed to establish prima facie case of cruelty, presumption cannot be drawn against the accused under Section 113-A of the Evidence Act.

(v) A perusal of the oral evidence of the parents of the deceased would indicate that only minor allegations are made against the first appellant and vague and cryptic allegations are made against the other accused with no specific allegation in respect of demand of dowry or harassment in any manner and in the absence of any definite evidence against the appellants, the Trial Court is not justified in convicting the appellants even for the offence punishable under Section 498A IPC.

(vi) The Trial Court, having found that the accused are not guilty for offence punishable under Section 306 IPC, has erred in finding the accused guilty for offence under Sections 498A and 498A read with Section 109 IPC. Admittedly, A4 and A5 are the sisters of A1 and they were married and living separately and none of the witnesses has made specific allegation against them for having abetted A1 to A3 to commit cruelty on the victim.

(vii) The appellants, by letting in evidence in defence, have proved that even few days prior to the occurrence, the first appellant had been taking the victim for treatment for conception and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis therefore, it is a case, where the victim had committed suicide on account of depression for not having able to conceive and not on account of cruelty, however, the Trial Court, without there being any legal evidence, had erred in convicting the accused.

4. In support of his contention the learned counsel for the appellants would rely on the following decisions:-

(i) Appasaheb and another vs. State of Maharashtra ((2007) 9 SCC 721)
(ii) Vipin Jaiswal vs. State of Andhra Pradesh ((2013) 3 SCC
684)
5. Per contra, Mr.S.Sugendran, learned Government Advocate (Criminal Side) would submit that it is a case where the victim had committed suicide in her matrimonial home within seven years of marriage and though the Trial Court had acquitted the accused for offence punishable under Section 306 IPC, there is ample evidence to prove that the accused had committed cruelty on the victim girl and that acquittal of charge under Section 306 IPC cannot be taken as a ground for acquittal under Section 498A IPC when the prosecution has brought in cogent evidence to bring home the charge under Section 498A IPC and that in this case, there is specific allegation against A1 that the first accused was not going out and he had been https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis in the habit of drinking harassing he victim in the nights and he had demanded Rs.2,00,000/-. He would further submit that it is the case of PW1 and PW2 that A1 had demanded a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- for repairing the house, however, he would fairly concede that there is no specific evidence as against the other accused for having committed cruelty on the victim and that they were living elsewhere.

6. Heard the learned counsel for the parties.

7. The case of the prosecution as revealed from the witnesses viz., PW1-Pappathi, mother of the deceased, PW2-Kalimuthu, father of the deceased, PW4-Kalaiselvan, brother of the deceased, PW3- Thirumurthy, paternal uncle of the deceased and PW5-Sakunthala and PW6-Mani are the relatives of the deceased. The first appellant is the husband of the deceased, appellants 2 and 3 are the parents of the first appellant and appellants 4 and 5 are the sisters of the first appellant.

8. Admittedly, the deceased and the appellants are relatives and the deceased and the first appellant were in love with each other and it was approved by the elders in both the family and the marriage had been conducted by both the families on 27.8.2010 at Ambrose Hall. At the time of marriage, the parents of the deceased had voluntarily given 10 sovereigns of jewels to her. After the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis marriage, the deceased was living with the first appellant and his parents, the second and third appellants at Kasthuribai Nagar as joint family. It is the further case that A1 and his family members often demanded the deceased to bring more jewels and money and a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- from her parental home for repairing and constructing of their house and that they had harassed the deceased to do household chores.

9. It is the further case that they have not even provided food to her regularly and treated her as a servant maid. Earlier, there was a difference of opinion between the deceased and A1 and she had gone back to her parents home and gave a complaint before the Perur All Women Police Station on 24.1.2011 with regard to the harassment made by the accused for which CSR No.28/11 was given. PW20, Sub Inspector of Police had summoned them and compromised them and on her advice, a separate home was established for the deceased and A1. The statement of the deceased recorded through compromise is marked as Ex.P2 series. It appears that the separate home is a old house belonging to A2, father of A1. It is the further evidence that subsequently, in the year 2012, one month prior to Pongal festival, the deceased had come to the house of PW1 and PW2 and had stated that her husband A1 had demanded Rs.2,00,000/- repairing a house https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and that she had told them that if she does not comply with the demand, he would do away with her life and that she is not able to bear the harassment of her drunkard husband, who was not going for work and was wandering in the nights.

10. PW2 the father of the deceased had also deposed that the deceased had come to their house one month prior to Pongal and had told him that A1 had demanded Rs.2,00,000/- for repairing their house which is in a dilapidated condition for which, P.Ws.1 and 2 had expressed their inability and had promised to give the same on PW2's business becomes better and sent her back to the house of the accused. P.Ws.1 and 2 had further deposed that on 29.1.2012, at 5.00 pm, while PW2 was going near Madukarrai for business, some one called him through phone and come to Alagesan Hospital and further PW6 Mani had informed PW1 that her daughter was ill and that when PW1 had gone to the house of A1, she had seen the first accused sitting naked over the body of the victim and was biting on her lips and PW1 had shouted and when the neighbours came and all of them took the victim to Alagesan Hospital, from where, she was taken to the Government Hospital where the Doctors examined and declared that the victim was dead.

11. Thus, the evidence of PW1 with respect to cruelty inflicted https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis upon the victim has been corroborated by PW2, father of the deceased. Apart from the evidence of PW2, PW3, who is the paternal uncle of the deceased and neighbour of the accused has spoken to about the cruelty inflicted by the accused on the deceased and in line with the evidence of P.Ws.1 and 2. Thus, P.Ws.1 to 3 have spoken with regard to the harassment of the first appellant by demanding Rs.2,00,000/- for repairing of their house and not providing food to her and not going to work and living a wayward life by drinking everyday.

12. Further, the evidence of P.Ws.1 to 3 has also been corroborated by the evidence of P.Ws.4 and 5. Thus, the witnesses have pin pointedly spoken about the overtact of the first appellant with regard to harassment and cruelty. The evidence shows that the averments against the accused who were living separately is vague and not specific.

13. It was contended by the learned counsel for the appellant that assuming that an amount of Rs.2,00,000/- was demanded for repairing the old house, it would not amount to demand of dowry. He would submit that a demand for money on account of some financial stringency or for meeting some urgent domestic expenses cannot be termed as a demand for dowry and in support of his contention, the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis learned counsel has relied on the decision of the Apex Court.

14. In Appasaheb and another vs. State of Maharashtra ((2007) 9 SCC 721), it has been held by the Apex Court as under:-

""11. In view of the aforesaid definition of the word “dowry” any property or valuable security should be given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly at or before or any time after the marriage and in connection with the marriage of the said parties. Therefore, the giving or taking of property or valuable security must have some connection with the marriage of the parties and a correlation between the giving or taking of property or valuable security with the marriage of the parties is essential. Being a penal provision it has to be strictly construed. Dowry is a fairly well-known social custom or practice in India. It is well-settled principle of interpretation of statute that if the Act is passed with reference to a particular trade, business or transaction and words are used which everybody conversant with that trade, business or transaction knows or understands to have a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis particular meaning in it, then the words are to be construed as having that particular meaning. (See Union of India v. Garware Nylons Ltd. [(1996) 10 SCC 413 : AIR 1996 SC 3509] and Chemical and Fibres of India Ltd. v. Union of India [(1997) 2 SCC 664 : AIR 1997 SC 558] .) A demand for money on account of some financial stringency or for meeting some urgent domestic expenses or for purchasing manure cannot be termed as a demand for dowry as the said word is normally understood. The evidence adduced by the prosecution does not, therefore, show that any demand for “dowry” as defined in Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act was made by the appellants as what was allegedly asked for was some money for meeting domestic expenses and for purchasing manure. Since an essential ingredient of Section 304-B IPC viz. demand for dowry is not established, the conviction of the appellants cannot be sustained.""
15. In Vipin Jaiswal vs. State of Andhra Pradesh, the Apex Court, relying the decision in Appa Saheb's case (supra) has held https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis as under:-

""9. We have perused the evidence of PW1 and PW4, the father and mother of the deceased respectively. We find that PW1 has stated that at the time of marriage, gold, silver articles, ornaments, TV, fridge and several other household articles worth more than Rs 2,50,000 were given to the appellant and after the marriage, the deceased joined the appellant in his house at Kagaziguda. He has, thereafter, stated that the appellant used to work in a xerox-cum-typing institute in Nampally and in the sixth month after marriage, the deceased came to their house and told them that the appellant asked her to bring Rs 50,000 from them as he was intending to purchase a computer and set up his own business. Similarly, PW 4 has stated in her evidence that five months after the marriage, the appellant sent her away to their house and when she questioned her, she told that the appellant was demanding Rs 50,000 and that the demand for money is to purchase a computer https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis to start his own business. Thus, the evidence of PW 1 and PW 4 is that the demand of Rs 50,000 by the appellant was made six months after the marriage and that too for purchasing a computer to start his own business. It is only with regard to this demand of Rs 50,000 that the trial court has recorded a finding of guilt against the appellant for the offence under Section 304-B IPC and it is only in relation to this demand of Rs.50,000 for purchase of a computer to start a business made by the appellant six months after the marriage that the High Court has also confirmed the findings of the trial court with regard to guilt of the appellant under Section 304-B IPC. In our view, both the trial court and the High Court failed to appreciate that the demand, if at all made by the appellant on the deceased for purchasing a computer to start a business six months after the marriage, was not in connection with the marriage and was not really a “dowry demand” within the meaning of Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.""
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

16. However, the principle laid down in the above decisions has been overruled in a later decision in Jatinder Kumar vs. State of Haryana ((2020) 16 SCC 721), by relying on the view taken by a three Judges Bench of the Apex Court in Rajinder Singh v. State of Punjab ((2015) 6 SCC 477) and held that any money or property or valuable security demanded by any of the persons mentioned in Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, at or before or at any time of marriage which is reasonably connected to the death of a married woman, would necessarily be in connection with or in relation to the marriage unless the facts of a given case clearly and unequivocally point otherwise. The relevant portion of the decision in Jatinder Kumar's case is extracted hereunder for ready reference:-

""9. But the view of the Court reflected in that judgment that seeking financial assistance would not per se constitute demand for dowry has been rejected by a later judgment of a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Rajinder Singh v. State of Punjab [Rajinder Singh v. State of Punjab, (2015) 6 SCC 477 : (2015) 3 SCC (Cri) 225] . Upon considering Appasaheb [Appasaheb v. State of Maharashtra, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis (2007) 9 SCC 721 : (2007) 3 SCC (Cri) 468] and certain other authorities, it was held in Rajinder Singh [Rajinder Singh v. State of Punjab, (2015) 6 SCC 477 : (2015) 3 SCC (Cri) 225] : (Rajinder Singh case [Rajinder Singh v. State of Punjab, (2015) 6 SCC 477 : (2015) 3 SCC (Cri) 225] , SCC p. 491, para 20) “20. Given that the statute with which we are dealing must be given a fair, pragmatic, and common sense interpretation so as to fulfil the object sought to be achieved by Parliament, we feel that the judgment in Appasaheb case [Appasaheb v. State of Maharashtra, (2007) 9 SCC 721 : (2007) 3 SCC (Cri) 468] followed by the judgment of Vipin Jaiswal [Vipin Jaiswal v. State of A.P., (2013) 3 SCC 684 : (2013) 2 SCC (Cri) 15] do not state the law correctly.
We, therefore, declare that any money or property or valuable security demanded by any of the persons mentioned in Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, at or before or at https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis any time after the marriage which is reasonably connected to the death of a married woman, would necessarily be in connection with or in relation to the marriage unless, the facts of a given case clearly and unequivocally point otherwise.”""

17. Coming to the case on hand, the witnesses have, in unequivocal terms, spoken about the victim having informed them about the demand of money made by the first appellant for repairing the house and further, harassing the victim. Even prior to one month to the death, the victim had informed her parents, P.Ws.1 and 2 that if the demand of A1 is not met out by her, she would be done to death.

18. It is to be noted that even in the complaint dated 29.1.2012, the de facto complainant has stated that the victim had informed her that the accused had demanded Rs.2,00,000/- from her and she doubts whether her daughter, the victim would have died due to non payment of the said amount. The complaint cannot be an encyclopedia to state everything in detail, however, in this case, a specific mention has been made about the demand.

19. Though a vague attempt has been made by the accused by https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis letting in defence witnesses to prove the fact that she was depressed on account of not being able to conceive and he had taken the victim for treatment to D.Ws.2 and 3 and by marking Ex.D1, the Trial Court had disbelieved his evidence. This court comes to the conclusion that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubts against the first appellant. The evidence against the other accused are not specific and they are vague.

20. In view of the above, the appeal stands partly allowed. The conviction and sentence in respect of appellants 2 to 4 stand set aside.

Aman Chouhan vs State Of M.P. on 7 January, 2025
This miscellaneous criminal case having been heard and reserved for orders, coming on for pronouncement this day, Justice Sanjeev S. Kalgaonkar pronounced the following:

This petition under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code is filed for quashment of FIR bearing Crime No.879/2023 dated 16.10.2023 registered at PS Barwani, District Barwanihajapur for offence punishable under Sections 376(1), 376(3), 376(2)(n), 294, 323, 506, 498A of IPC and Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of POCSO Act and Section 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act and consequential criminal proceedings at SC No.114/2023 NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-IND:277
2 MCRC-20208-2024 pending before the learned 1st Additional Sessions Judge and Special Judge(POCSO Act), Barwani, District Barwani.

2. The exposition of the facts giving rise to the present petition is as under :-

The prosecutrix/complainant aged around 23 years reported to SHO of Police Station, Barwani on 16.10.2023 that she got friendly with Aman Chouhan in the year 2013, when she was studying in Class-IXth. In September 2013, Aman enticed her and took her to the house of his friend. Aman proposed to marry her when she attains age of 18 years and on the promise of marriage Aman forcefully sexually assaulted her. Thereafter, on multiple occasions, Aman had sexual relations with her. In the year 2019, she was studying at Sirpur and Indore, Aman had physical relations with her against her will on the pretext of marriage. In the year 2021, she got pregnant. Aman compelled her for abortion. Her family was not ready to marry her with Aman, but family members of Aman were ready for the marriage. Her marriage with Aman was performed at Arya Samaj, Mhow on 15.06.2023. After few days of marriage, her husband Aman Chouhan (petitioner no.1), father-in-law Ravi @ Ravindra Singh Chouhan (petitioner no.2) and mother- in-law Laxmi Chouhan (petitioner no.3) started torturing her with regard to inadequate dowry. She was asked to bring Rs.5 Lacs and a Car from her father. The accused were harassing her mentally and physically for demand of dowry. Aman used to manhandle and abuse her in filthy language. They threatened to kill her if she does not fulfill the demands. She informed her father and maternal aunt. Her father got her rented room near Sawariya at Badwani. Aman came to reside with her, but after some time left her and stopped communication with her. Aman had sexually exploited her during her NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-IND:277
3 MCRC-20208-2024 minority. Her husband Aman, her father-in-law and her mother-in-law had physically and mentally harassed her for demand of dowry. On such allegations, PS Badwani, District Badwani registered FIR at Crime No.879/2023 for offence punishable under Sections 376(1), 376(3), 376(2)

(n), 294, 323, 506, 498A of IPC and Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of POCSO Act and Section 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act against Aman Chouhan, Ravi @ Ravindra Singh Chouhan and Laxmi Chouhan. The statements of prosecutrix were recorded under Sections 161 and 164 of Cr.P.C. On completion of investigation, final report was submitted. The trial is pending at SC. No.114/2023 before the learned Special Judge (POCSO Act), Badwani.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the trial is presently at the stage of defense evidence.

4. The FIR and criminal proceedings are assailed in the present petition on the following grounds :-

(1) False allegations are levelled against the petitioners. The prosecutrix as well as the accused, was minor at the time of allegations with regard to sexual assault. The prosecutrix married Aman at her own will in the year 2021. The prosecutrix was major, therefore, the allegations of abortion against petitioner Aman Chouhan are false and baseless.
(2) The prosecutrix was expelled by her father from parental home. The petitioners no.2 and 3 got her married with their son. The prosecutrix and the petitioner Aman had performed love marriage. The general and omnibus allegations are made against the petitioners regarding demand of dowry and harassment. No offence as alleged is made out against the petitioners.
5. On these grounds, it is requested that FIR registered at Crime NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-IND:277 4 MCRC-20208-2024 No.879/2023 and consequential criminal proceedings at SC. No.114/2023 deserves to be quashed.

6. Learned counsel for the petitioner, at the outset, requested not to prosecute this petition qua petitioner no.1 Aman Chouhan, however, learned counsel submitted that petitioner Ravi @ Ravindra Singh Chouhan and Laxmi are charged with offence punishable under Section 498A of IPC only. General and omnibus allegations regarding harassment and demand of dowry are made against the petitioners Ravi @ Ravindra Singh Chouhan and Laxmi Chouhan. No offence, as alleged, is made out on the basis of general and omnibus allegations, therefore, FIR and consequential proceedings deserves to be quashed.

7. Per contra, learned counsel for the State ably assisted by the learned counsel for the complainant/objector contended that the complainant in the FIR and her statements recorded under Sections 161 and 164 of Cr.P.C. has made specific allegations of harassment with regard to demand of dowry against both the petitioners. He further submitted that the charges in the matter were framed on 29.10.2023 and the petition is filed belatedly on 10.05.2024. The proceedings cannot be quashed at belated stage of defense evidence.

8. In reply, learned counsel for the petitioners relying on the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Satish Mehra Vs. State(NCT of Delhi) & Another reported in (2012) 13 SCC 614 contends that the quashment of proceedings can be considered at any stage of the trial provided the material on record does not disclose the commission of offence alleged against the accused.

9. Heard both the parties and perused the record as well as the case NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-IND:277 5 MCRC-20208-2024 diary.

10. The Supreme Court in the case of Satish Mehra (Supra) has held as under :-

14. The power to interdict a proceeding either at the threshold or at an intermediate stage of the trial is inherent in a High Court on the broad principle that in case the allegations made in the FIR or the criminal complaint, as may be, prima facie do not disclose a triable offence there can be reason as to why the accused should be made to suffer the agony of a legal proceeding that more often than not gets protracted. A prosecution which is bound to become lame or a sham ought to interdicted in the interest of justice as continuance thereof will amount to an abuse of the process of the law. This is the core basis on which the power to interfere with a pending criminal proceeding has been recognized to be inherent in every High Court. The power, though available, being extra ordinary in nature has to be exercised sparingly and only if the attending facts and circumstances satisfies the narrow test indicated above, namely, that even accepting all the allegations levelled by the prosecution, no offence is disclosed. However, if so warranted, such power would be available for exercise not only at the threshold of a criminal proceeding but also at a relatively advanced stage thereof, namely, after framing of the charge against the accused. In fact the power to quash a proceeding after framing of charge would appear to be somewhat wider as, at that stage, the materials revealed by the investigation carried out usually comes on record and such materials can be looked into, not for the purpose of determining the guilt or innocence of the accused but for the purpose of drawing satisfaction that such materials, even if accepted in its entirety, do not, in any manner, disclose the commission of the offence alleged against the accused.
11. However, the Supreme Court in Para-17 of same judgment laid down the principles governing the contours of the inherent power as under :-

17. While dealing with contours of the inherent power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash a criminal proceeding, another decision of this court in Padal Venkata Rama Reddy alias Ramu vs. Kovvuri Satyanaryana Reddy and others reported in (2011) NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-IND:277 6 MCRC-20208-2024
12 SCC 437 to which one of us (Justice P.Sathasivam) was a party may be usefully noticed. In the said decision after an exhaustive consideration of the principles governing the exercise of the said power as laid down in several earlier decisions this court held that:

31. . . . . When exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code, the High Court would not ordinarily embark upon an enquiry whether the evidence in question is reliable or not or whether on reasonable appreciation of it accusation would not be sustained. That is the function of the trial Judge. The scope of exercise of power under Section 482 and the categories of cases where the High Court may exercise its power under it relating to cognizable offences to prevent abuse of process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice were set out in detail in Bhajan Lal[4].
The powers possessed by the High Court under Section 482 are very wide and at the same time the power requires great caution in its exercise. The Court must be careful to see that its decision in exercise of this power is based on sound principles. The inherent power should not be exercised to stifle a legitimate prosecution.""

12. The complainant has made specific allegations against her mother-in- law Laxmi Chouhan and father-in-law Ravi @ Ravindra Singh Chouhan(petitioners) regarding demand of dowry and her mental and physical harassment amounting to cruelty. As per allegations, the complainant was compelled to leave her matrimonial home and stayed at the rented premises near Sawariya Mandir at Barwani due to constant harassment by the petitioners. Thus, the allegations cannot be said to be general, omnibus, absurd or inherently improbable. The evidence of the prosecution witnesses have been recorded and the trial is at the belated stage of defense evidence, therefore, this Court is not expected to embark upon enquiry whether the evidence of the prosecutrix is reliable or not. The trial Court would appreciate the evidence and consider the veracity of accusation on merits of the NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-IND:277 7 MCRC-20208-2024 evidence. In view of above discussion, stifling the proceedings before the trial Court, at the belated stage of trial, would itself be an abuse of process of law, therefore, this Court is of the considered opinion that no case is made out for quashment of the FIR and consequential criminal proceedings pending before the learned 1st Additional Sessions Judge and Special Judge(POCSO Act), Barwani at Special Case No.114/2023.

13. Consequently, the petition is dismissed.

                                                           JUDGMENT
On 20.05.2014, when P.W.17, Kala, Sub-Inspector of Police, was on duty at Kuvagam Police Station, P.W.1, Ganesan, appeared before her and lodged a complaint to the effect that his daughter, Sita, was given in marriage to the first accused, Sivakumar and a child was born on account of the wedlock. Right from three months from the date of marriage, her in-laws and other family members repeatedly abused and treated his daughter with cruelty and teased her that she belonged to a poor family. They have also threatened that since she did not bring any dowry, they are making arrangements to get the first accused married again. Unable to bear all these torture and cruelty, his daughter, Sita, came back to his house.


2. While so, on 16.05.2014, the second appellant/A-4, Ramachandran, who is the brother of the first accused along with his wife and others came to the house of P.W.1 and attacked the wife of P.W.1 and snatched away the tender child. On account of the same, his daughter had consumed some poisonous leaves (xLtd;jiH) about 1 p.m. and immediately thereof, she was taken to Senthurai hospital and after first aid, she was referred to Ariyalur Government Hospital. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Thereafter, she was taken to a private hospital, namely, Golden Hospital, for specialised treatment and thereafter, she was taken to Apollo Hospital, Trichy. However, not responding to the treatment, she succumbed on 20.05.2014 and therefore, requested for action against all the accused.


3. On the strength of the said complaint, a case in Crime No.76 of 2014 was registered initially under Section 174(iii) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (in short 'Cr.P.C.'). P.W.21, the Investigating Officer, thereafter, upon receipt of the report of the Revenue Divisional Officer, altered the provision of offence to one under Sections 304B and 498A of the Indian Penal Code (in short 'the IPC') and took up the case for investigation and laid the final report proposing totally five persons, namely, one Sivakumar, the first accused/husband of the victim, one Kasinathan, the second accused/father-in-law of the victim, one Rukkumani, the third accused/mother-in-law of the victim, one Ramachandran, the fourth accused/brother-in-law of the victim and one Usha, the fifth accused/sister of the third accused. The case was taken on file in P.R.C.No.21 of 2015 by the learned Judicial Magistrate, Jayamkondan and upon appearance of the accused and furnishing of copies, the case was committed to the learned District and Sessions https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Judge, Ariyalur. Upon committal, the case was taken on file as S.C.No.96 of 2015 and was made over to the Trial Court, namely, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur, for conducting trial.

4. The Trial Court, after considering the materials on record, on 14.12.2015, framed two charges under Section 498A and 304B IPC against all the accused persons. Upon being questioned, all the accused denied the charges and stood trial. Thereafter, in order to prove the charges, the prosecution examined the father of the victim, namely, one Ganesan, as P.W.1. The sister of the victim, one Sanghavi, was examined as P.W.2. Another sister of the victim, one Sathya, was examined as P.W.3. The co-brother of P.W.1, one Selvaraj, was examined as P.W.4. The cousin brother of P.W.1, one Kumar, was examined as P.W.5. The maternal uncle of the victim, one Palanivel, was examined as P.W.6. One Jayaraman, who was a neighbour sought to be examined as independent witness and who was examined as P.W.7, turned hostile. The mother of the victim, namely, Gandhimathi, was examined as P.W.8. One Karunanithi, who was a resident of the village and is the father-in-law of P.W.3, was examined as P.W.9. One Kaliyaperumal, a resident of the village, who was sought to be examined as independent witness and who was examined https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis as P.W.10, turned hostile. P.W.11, one Rajendran, a resident of the village, who was sought to be examined as independent witness, turned hostile. Similarly, P.W.12, one Manivannan, sought to be examined as independent witness, turned hostile. One Dr.Sivam was examined as P.W.13 in the place of the doctor who gave treatment to the victim at the Apollo Hospital, Trichy. One Dr.Kanmani, who gave treatment to the victim at Golden Hospital, Trichy, was examined as P.W.14. One Dr.Saravanan, who conducted post-mortem, was examined as P.W.15. One Dr.Anbarasu, who examined the victim at Ariyalur Government Hospital in the casualty ward was examined as P.W.16. The Sub-Inspector of Police, who registered the F.I.R., was examined as P.W.17. The Head Constable, who gave the requisition letter to the Revenue Divisional Officer and who accepted the organs after post-mortem for viscera report and who submitted the same for forensic examination, was examined as P.W.18. The brother of the third accused, one Velusamy, was examined as P.W.19. The Revenue Divisional Officer, who conducted the enquiry, was examined as P.W.20. The Investigating Officer was examined as P.W.21. On behalf of the prosecution, Exs.P.1 to P.17 were also marked. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

5. Upon being questioned about the material evidence and incriminating circumstances on record under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C., the accused denied the same as false. Thereafter, on behalf of the defence, the Superintendent of the District Head Quarters Hospital, one Dr.Krishnamurthy, was examined as D.W.1. One Krishnamurthy, S/o.Kaliyaperumal, who received the telephonic message from Ariyalur Government Hospital about the fact that the victim attempted to commit suicide by consuming poisonous leaves, was examined as D.W.2. One Balamurugan, Grade II Constable, who received information from the Apollo Hospital about the admission of the victim, was examined as D.W.3. One Periyanayagam, who is also related to both sides, was examined as D.W.4. One Umamaheswari, wife of the fourth accused, Ramachandran, was examined as D.W.5. One Dhanalakshmi, a neighbour residing near the house of the accused, was examined as D.W.6. The second accused, Kasinathan, examined himself as D.W.7. On behalf of the defence, Exs.D.1 to D.8 were also marked.


6. After the closure of evidence on the defence side, the Trial Court proceeded to hear the learned Special Public Prosecutor on https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis behalf of the prosecution and the learned counsel for the accused and by judgment dated 20.04.2016, considered the evidence on record and acquitted all the accused in respect of the offence under Section 304B IPC. The Trial Court also acquitted the second accused, Kasinathan, of the offence under Section 498A IPC. However, the Trial Court found A-1 and A-3 to A-5 guilty of the offence under Section 498A IPC. As far as A-3 is concerned, considering the role played by her and her conduct and age, she was released under Section 360 Cr.P.C. upon executing a bond for a sum of Rs.10,000/- along with two sureties. As far as A-5, Usha, is concerned, she was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of 19 days, which she had already undergone and was imposed a fine of Rs.5,000/-. As far as the first accused, Sivakumar, is concerned, he was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of two years and was ordered to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- and in default of payment of fine, to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of three months. Accused No.4, Ramachandran, was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of three years and was ordered to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/- and in default of payment of fine, to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of three months. Aggrieved by the findings of guilt and sentence imposed against them, Accused Nos.1 and 4, namely, the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis husband of the victim, Sivakumar and his brother, Ramachandran, have filed this appeal.


7. Heard Mr.K.Gandhikumar and Ms.A.Nethra, learned counsel appearing for the appellants/accused and Mr.J.Subbiah, learned Government Advocate (Crl. Side) on behalf of the prosecution.

8. Commencing the arguments on behalf of the appellants, Ms.A.Nethra, learned counsel, taking this Court to the evidence on record, would submit that as far as the fourth accused is concerned, the allegation against him is that on 16.05.2014, he had come along with D.W.5, to the victim's mother house and snatched away the child by physically assaulting the victim as well as P.W.8, mother. In this regard, she would submit that even as per P.W.8, the persons in the locality were resisting such illegal forceful attempt made by A-4. But, however, all the independent witnesses, namely, P.Ws.7 and 10 to 12, who were examined for the said purpose, turned hostile and did not support the case of the prosecution. This apart, while the allegation in the complaint was as if the child was taken away forcefully, P.W.8 herself, in her cross-examination, had stated that even the victim had told A-4 that the child is sleeping in the cradle and that he himself can https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis take the child if he wants and therefore, there is a major contradiction regarding the said vital aspect of the matter. Secondly, by examination of all the witnesses, it is established by the defence that from the beginning, P.W.8, the mother of the victim, was not inclined to give her daughter in marriage to A-1, who was the sister's son of P.W.1 and on the other hand, it was her intention to get her daughter married to her own brother, who is P.W.6. As a matter of fact, the admissions made by all the relative witnesses, which the learned counsel took the Court to, would prove the said allegation on behalf of the defence. Therefore, the version of the defence is that already when P.W.8 was not in favour of the marriage and when the victim had come home complaining about her in-laws, she had started picking up quarrel with her own daughter admonishing her not to send the child for the birthday function of A-4. In order to prove that there is a birthday function, even the birth certificate of the child of A-4 is also marked as a defence document, namely, Ex.D.2. Only because of the quarrel picked up by P.W.8, unable to withstand the pressure, the victim had committed suicide. Only because of the said fact, even when the victim was alive and conscious for a period of four days and in spite of Ex.D.1 and intimation by all the hospitals to the police station and in spite of the visits of the police personnel, no statement https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis has been recorded from the victim. Had any statement was recorded from the victim, she would have come out with the truth as to for what reason she had consumed the poisonous leaves (xLtd;jiH). Therefore, the non-examination of the victim when she was alive and conscious for four days clearly raises a grave suspicion on the case of the prosecution.


9. Secondly, only after the death of the victim, as an after- thought, the complaint was given. When P.W.20, the Revenue Divisional Officer, conducted the enquiry, even though all the family members and the accused were very much present, none were examined and their statements were recorded by the Revenue Divisional Officer leading to a unilateral and biased conclusion that there was demand of dowry by the in-laws and that the suicide happened only because of demand of dowry. Therefore, the case of the prosecution was rightly disbelieved by the Trial Court as far as the offence under Section 304B is concerned.


10. As far as the allegation of cruelty is concerned, since the incident dated 16.05.2014 relating to the snatching away of the child has been disproved and since there is no other allegation relating to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis cruelty, the Trial Court ought not to have convicted the appellants for the offence under Section 498A IPC also and hence, pleaded acquittal. Learned counsel, Ms.Nethra, would also submit that the entire claim was an after-thought and when the victim being hyper-sensitive in nature had committed suicide on account of the pressure meted out to her by everyone in her family including her own mother, the conviction of the appellants for the offence under Section 498A IPC is uncalled for.


11. Per contra, Mr.J.Subbiah, learned Government Advocate (Crl. Side), opposing the said allegations, would submit that in this case, P.W.1, the father and the first informant, P.Ws.2 and 3, the sisters, P.W.8, the mother, all of them have clearly and categorically deposed about the acts committed by the accused, who are the husband and other in-laws of the victim. They had clearly and categorically stated that the accused had tortured her for not bringing enough jewels. Even though the aspect as to the dowry demand being the reason for torture soon before the death has been disbelieved by the Trial Court, still the verbal abuses that she was hailing from a poor family and her parents are not rich enough, which became the cause for mental harassment and agony of the victim, cannot be overlooked and the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Trial Court has rightly taken the said allegations into consideration while convicting the accused including the appellants.

12. The learned Government Advocate would further submit that P.W.8 is the eye witness to the incident of snatching of the baby. It can be seen that the baby was four months old and it cannot be taken away by the second appellant/Accused No.4 on his own without the mother for the birthday function. He would further submit that the Accused No.2, being the Sub-Inspector of Police, and his family members, behaved in a high-handed manner abusing the victim and her family, as they were economically poorer than them and unable to bear the said torture only, the victim had committed suicide. As a matter of fact, like every other parent, when the victim had consumed the poisonous leaves (xLtd;jiH) and was battling for her life, even though was conscious and when she was referred from one hospital to the other informing them that the condition is serious and has been referring the victim for treatment to the higher institution, their entire concentration will only be in saving the life of the victim and they will not merely run to the police station to give the complaint. It is only in this context that the complaint was not given and once the victim died, immediately they lodged the complaint and therefore, this explains the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis non-examination of the victim as well as the delay in lodging the complaint and that factor should not come in the view of this Court to doubt the case of the prosecution. Therefore, he would submit that the Trial Court has rightly considered the case from all perspectives and had rightly imposed the lenient sentences on Accused No.5 and even released A-3 on probation of good conduct considering the allegations against her. Upon considering the seriousness of the allegations against these two appellants, appropriate sentences have been imposed, which do not require any interference whatsoever by this Court.


13. In reply, Mr.Gandhikumar, learned counsel appearing for the appellants, while summarising and reiterating the arguments made by the other learned counsel, Ms.Nethra, would draw the attention of this Court to the cross-examination of P.W.1, the father and P.W.8, the mother which would clearly demonstrate the equations in the family. He would once again submit that when there is discrepancy between the evidence on record and the original complaint regarding the manner in which the child was alleged to have been snatched away, the second appellant is entitled for benefit of doubt. He would submit that the child is now ten years old and is now being brought up only by https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the first accused and is currently studying 4th standard in Sabarmathi Vidhyalaya Public School, Ariyalur. He would submit that as a matter of fact, on the day of the said incident, i.e., 16.05.2014, admittedly the first accused was in Chennai and is no way in any manner directly or indirectly responsible for the victim committing suicide. He would further submit that even the other allegations of cruelty of verbal abuse is not substantiated by the prosecution and would, therefore, submit that the first accused also is entitled for the benefit of doubt.

14. I have considered the rival submissions made on either side and perused the material records of the case. Firstly, as far as the offence under Section 304B IPC is concerned, the Trial Court itself had acquitted all the accused. Therefore, we are now concerned in respect of the appeals filed by Accused Nos.1 and 4 in respect of their conviction and sentence imposed for the offence under Section 498A IPC.


15. On a cumulative reading of the entire evidence on record, it can be seen that there are three sets of allegations, which would amount to cruelty within the definition of Section 498A IPC. The first set of allegation is the demand of dowry as such. The second set of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis allegation is that the victim was constantly ill-treated and abused by the family members of the accused and was constantly made to go back to her parental home. She was also even physically tortured and verbally abused and was very much unable to withstand the said behaviour on the part of her in-laws and especially, when the first accused being the husband did nothing to protect her and give comfort to her in the house. The third set of allegation is that on the day of occurrence, i.e., 16.05.2014, for the purpose of celebrating the birthday function or otherwise, the child was forcefully taken away by A-4 in the company of D.W.5 which triggered the victim to consume poisonous leaves.


16. As far as the first set of allegation is concerned, it can be seen that the family of the victim was financially lesser than her in- laws' house. As a matter of fact, the evidence on record being the evidence of the relatives clearly adumbrates that it was the intention of A-3, Rukkumani, that she will make her own own brother's daughter as her daughter-in-law so that she will be taken good care of. This apart, either in connection with the marriage or thereafter, there is no evidence clearly bringing on record that there was any demand for dowry and as a matter of fact, the Trial Court itself had disbelieved the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis said allegations and consequently, had acquitted the accused in respect of the offence under Section 304B IPC. Therefore, the first set of allegations has no legs to stand.


17. As far as the third set of allegations regarding the incident of forcefully taking away the child by even throwing a stone on P.W.8 is concerned, except P.W.8, the other independent witnesses who are supposed to have witnessed the incident and were examined as witnesses by the prosecution, namely, P.Ws.7 and 10 to 12, all turned hostile and did not support the case of the prosecution. Even otherwise, from the very evidence of P.W.8 herself that her daughter told Accused No.4 to take the child by himself from the cradle would also throw a considerable doubt on the version of P.W.8. This apart, a cumulative reading of the defence witnesses and that of the prosecution, raises a suspicion whether the theory of the prosecution that the victim never wanted the child to be taken for the birthday function is correct or not or whether she also wanted to go but was admonished from her parents side. There is a needle of doubt in this regard and therefore, once there is a slightest suspicion with regard to the manner in which the incident happened, especially when all the independent witnesses have turned hostile, as far as this set of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis allegations is concerned, this Court has no other option than to give the benefit of doubt to the accused. But, however, as regards the other set of allegations that the victim was constantly subjected to verbal abuse and that she used to go to her parents' house unable to bear the verbal abuses, those allegations are fortified by the statement of P.Ws.1 to 3 who are the family members of the victim. As a matter of fact, even from the evidence of D.W.5, the fact that the victim was in her parents house even as on the date of her consuming poisonous leaves is fortified. Therefore, as a husband, it is incumbent upon A-1 not to have indulged in those kinds of mental torture and cruelty and also the failure to protect the victim who had come to live in his family only believing him, the allegation regarding the abuse and mental torture stands proved as far as Accused No.1 is concerned. However, as far as Accused No.4 is concerned, except for snatching away the child, there is no other allegation regarding the abuse on his part.

18. In view of my above findings, the finding of guilt in respect of the offence under Section 498A IPC in respect of the first accused, Sivakumar, is upheld with reference to the allegation of verbal abuse and ill-treatment. The finding of guilt in respect of the offence under Section 498A IPC in respect of the fourth accused, Ramachandran, is https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis reversed and he is acquitted of the offence under Section 498A IPC also.


19. Now, coming to the quantum of sentence, even though in this case unfortunately the victim had died, this Court is able to see that the first accused Sivakumar was arrested and was in jail for a period of 65 days. He is also now bringing up the child born out of the wedlock who is now studying 4th standard in a private school as narrated above. This Court also takes into consideration that the death had happened four months after the delivery of the child and that the victim was sensitive and on the day of the incident, the first accused was away in Chennai. Further, there is also evidence on record that after hearing about the committing of suicide by the victim, all visited the victim while she was undergoing treatment in the hospitals. Under such peculiar circumstances and conspectus of facts, I am inclined to reduce the substantive sentence imposed by the Trial Court against the first accused from rigorous imprisonment for a period of two years to that of the period already undergone. The fine amount shall remain the same.

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

20. In the result, the Criminal Appeal is partly allowed, acquitting Ramachandran, the second appellant/A-4 of the offence under Section 498A IPC and while confirming the conviction of Sivakumar, the first appellant/A-1 for the offence under Section 498A IPC, the substantive sentence of rigorous imprisonment for a period of two years is reduced to the period already undergone by the first appellant/A-1. The fine amount imposed on the first appellant is confirmed. The second Appellant/Accused No.4, shall be entitled for refund of fine amount, if any, paid by him.

                    JUDGMENT
The present case emanates from the udr no.7/ 2013 under section 174C of the code of criminal procedure based on information of Sri Chikkanna @ Kumar on 11.02.2013 at 8.45 p.m and sent through Sri Gaviyappa PC 5852. Thereafter a statement of the father of the deceased to the executive engineer on 12.02.2013 at 5.00 p.m and registered in cr.no.58/ 2013.

2. The case of the prosecution in a nut shell could be summarised as follows;


The father of the deceased had three daughters and a son. They are Smt Vasanth Kumari, Smt Shashikala and the deceased, Smt Mangalagowri. Smt Mangalagowri was given in marriage to Sri Manjegowda S/O Javarappa Naduvanahalli Village Thuruvekere on 8.06.2012 at Beeralingeshwara Temple in Kuppuru. At the time of marriage the informant claims to have given golden mangalya chain, a long chain, a necklace a pair of bangles, ear rings hangings saree as dowry. The informant claims to have borne the marriage expenses. After the marriage the couple had started living in a rented house no.151, 4th cross, pramod layout ringroad, Bengaluru 3rd floor got by the informant. The accused is said to have been running a car on hire.

3. About 5 months prior to the incident the car being run on hire by the accused was purchased by the son of the informant and his friend, sri srikanth on down payment of Rs.2,76,00-00 and Rs.15,000-00 being the first installment. Thereafter the accused would be under an obligation to pay the remaining installments. The couple were living happily. The wife and son of the informant used to visit the accused and their daughter. The daughter of the informant/ deceased was also employed in a nearby plastic factory. On 11.02.2013 at 6.00 p.m the son of the informant had called up the informant informing him that there was some mishap with Smt Mangalagowri.

4. The informant along with his wife, relatives and villagers had rushed to the house where they had found police who informed them that the body was shifted to Victoria hospital. When they had gone to the hospital it was night and hence could not see the body. They had again returned to the house and had seen ashes and remains of burnt articles in the house. On seeing the daughter completely burnt the informant was unaware as to the cause of death and hence the information was tendered.

5. Accused is on bail. Charges framed. Case stood posted for statement of the accused under section 313 of the Cr.P.C. Accused has denied the charge and claimed to be tried.

6. To prove the case, the prosecution has examined its witnesses as P.W.1 to P.W.23. The documents are marked as Ex.P.1 to P.32 and material objects marked as M.O.1 to M.O.11.

7. Heard both. Counsel for accused relied upon decisions cited below:

1. ILR 2018 KAR 6
2. KCCR 2020 (4) Page 3189 (DB)
3. KCCR 2019 (1) Page 847 (DB)
4. KCCR 2019 (4) Page 1417 (DB)
5. KCCR 2018 (4) Page 3614 (DB)
6. ILR 2018 KAR Page 5223
8. The points that arise for my consideration are:

1. Whether the prosecution proves beyond all reasonable doubt that accused married deceased Smt. Mangala Gowri on 08.06.2012 by demanding cash and gold as dowry.
After the marriage, accused started to harass the deceased to get more dowry from her parents house and thereby committed an offense punishable under Sec.498A of IPC?

2. Whether the prosecution proves beyond all reasonable doubt that on 10.12.2013 at 12.00p.m, accused picked up quarrel and assaulted the deceased with wooden club on her head and when she fell down, accused dumped clothes on her, pured diesel and set ablaze and committed her murder and thereby committed an offense punishable under Sec.302 of IPC?

3. Whether the prosecution proves beyond all reasonable doubt that on the above said place, date and time, accused committed murder of Smt. Mangala Gowri and the said death taken place within 7 years from the date of her marriage and thereby committed an offense punishable under Sec.304B of IPC?

4. What order?

9. My findings on the above points are as hereunder:

              Point No.1 to 3             : In the Affirmative
              Point No.4                  : As per final order
                                                   for the following:
                         :REASONS:

10. Point No.1 : P.W.1 is the father of the deceased who is also an informant on whose information the present case emanates. According to the witness about 2 years 6 months prior the date on which the witness was examined the marriage of the deceased was solemnised with the accused in the presence of elders. At the time of marriage dowry in the form of 25 gms of gold and Rs.23,000-00 was given to the accused. On the accused insisting for giving 150 gms of golden ornaments to the deceased this witness claims to have complied with the said demand. The deceased was happy for four months from the date of marriage and the couple are said to lived in Bengaluru. This witness asserts that he does not know the area where the couple were living and it is his son who knew it.

11. Thereafter the accused is alleged to have demanded car from the deceased. The son of this witness is said to have gathered Rs.2,75,000-00 and the remaining amount was to borrowed as loan and repaid in equal monthly installments of Rs.15,000-00. On this condition a car was purchased as demanded by the accused. After four months of the purchase of the car the accused had again demanded another car and if the deceased failed to get him another car he knew everybody in Bangalore and would kill her. The deceased is said to have informed of this threat to the wife of this witness on phone. In this regard the accused is alleged to have meted out cruelty to the deceased for not meeting the demand made by him. The son and a relative of this witness, sri praveen are said to have visited the house of accused when the deceased had narrated the acts of cruelty meted out to her by the accused for not meeting demand for a second car to sri praveen and if she disclosed of her plight to her brother he would get depressed.

12. This witness claims to have also informed the relatives regarding the purchase of second car. After about 7 months of the marriage his son was informed by the police regarding the death of the deceased. The son in turn is said to have informed the wife of this witness. This witness along with about 10-12 relatives claim to have proceeded to Bangalore and reached the destination by 2.00 in the morning. They had then gone to the police station in the morning and were informed that the dead body of the deceased was kept in the hospital. They had then gone to the hospital and after the entire process of autopsy the body of the deceased was handed over to this witness. The witness claims to have gone to the spot and found that the deceased was set ablaze using petrol and articles were lying burnt and walls and ceiling were found blackened. The witness has identified his left thumb impression on the first information statement. The first information statement is at Ex.P.1.


13. The witness had identified the deceased and the accused in the photographs marked as Ex.P.2 to 5. The witness was cross examined by the learned p.p on permission in respect of authorities at the hospital and the time at which the body was handed over to them after autopsy. These are not so material contradiction even if the witness had failed to admit the suggestions made. It is elicited through this witness during cross examination that he has 5 acres of land that involves 2 acres of coconut plantation and 3 acres is barren land. The annual income then was Rs.10,000-00. The witness claims to have four children, three daughters and a son, Smt Vasanth Kumari, Smt Shashikala, Smt Mangalagowri and Sri Shankaralingaiah. The witness is found to have asserted that he had given some valuables when he was suggested that he had performed the marriage of his elder daughters as per traditions.

14. A suggestion was also made that this witness had performed the marriage similar to the marriages of his elder daughter to which the witness is found to have asserted that he had performed the marriage with grandeur by spending Rs.7-8 lakhs. The witness also asserts that the value of a gram of gold then was Rs.2,000-00 and 150 gms of golden ornaments was given to the deceased on being insisted by the accused. The witness had denied the suggestion that the value of gold during those days was never Rs.2,000-00 per gram. There is no suggestion found to have been made by the accused as to the value of a gram of gold at that time. The son of this witness was a central government employee with a monthly salary of Rs.22,000-00. P.W.2, Sri Shankaralingaiah son of C.W.1 and brother of the deceased also had deposed on 10.12.2014 contending that the marriage of the deceased and the accused was performed during June 2012 at Sri Beeralingeshwar temple in kuppur.

15. On the demand made by the accused 25 gms of golden ornaments and Rs.23,000-00 were given to the accused at the time of marriage. 150 gms of golden ornaments are said to be given to the deceased on being insisted upon by the accused. Even this witness is found to have denied the suggestion that the marriage of the deceased was performed in a similar manner as performed in respect of the other two sisters. The witness volunteers to assert that whatever was given at the time of marriage was on being demanded by the accused. This witness is found to have no knowledge regarding the occupation and the lifestyle of the accused. It is not requirement of law that this witness must necessarily know these aspects in minutest details.

16. P.W.3, Smt Kamalamma wife of C.W.1 and mother of the deceased also is found to have asserted regarding 25 gms of golden ornaments and Rs.23,000- 00 being given to the accused and 150 gms of golden ornaments to the deceased on the demand made by the accused. Even this witness is found to have assertively denied the suggestion that the golden ornaments and money were given voluntarily and as a matter of tradition similar to the acts of giving during the marriages of their other elder daughters. The witness is found to assert that the ornaments and money were given on the demand made by the accused. P.W.10, Sri Bhaskar is one of the sons-in-law of C.W.1 and C.W.2. This witness is found to have corroborated the fact of demand for dowry by the accused.

17. However during the cross examination there is stray admission of this witness that the golden ornaments and money were given as a matter of tradition. Apart from that in respect of the valuables given at the time of marriage the witness is found to have asserted that it was on the basis of demand. P.W.11, Smt Shanthamma who is the sister of the mother of the deceased i.e. C.W.2. this witness is also found to have supported the case of the prosecution in so far as the demand made by the accused for dowry at the time of marriage. According to this witness the marriage of the deceased was solmenised on 8.06.2012. Nothing is found to have been elicited through this witness during the cross examination so as to impeach the credibility of this witness.

18. P.W.12, Smt Vasanthamma one of the daughters of C.W.1 also had deposed that the marriage of the deceased was solemnised on 8.06.2012. according to this witness Rs.25,000-00 and 150 gms of golden ornaments were given as dowry at the time of marriage. The money was given at the time of engagement and the ornaments were given at the time of marriage. The variation in the quantum could be noticed however only on account of this it cannot be concluded that there was neither the demand nor the valuables given. These variations are not sufficient to hold that the version of the prosecution that there was demand for dowry by the accused and giving of dowry are false. P.W.13, Smt Shashikala is another daughter of C.W.1 who similarly is found to have asserted that dowry was given to the accused at the time of marriage. The accused also is not found to seriously dispute taking of ornaments or money but his only contention was that they were given voluntarily as a matter of customary practice and tradition similar to the valuables given at the time of marriage of the other daughters of C.W.1.

19. However C.W.1 and 2 are found to have denied that the giving of valuables was voluntary and as a matter of customary practice or tradition. The accused cannot claim valuables as a matter of tradition and similar to the valuables given by the C.W.1 at the time of marriage of his other daughters. P.W.17, sri praveen kumar is a relative of the deceased and a constable. The witness is found to have deposed regarding the demand made by the accused for dowry at the time of marriage. This witness refers to bracelet demanded by the accused but the parents of the deceased had refused to give bracelet and the ornaments were given to the accused at the time of marriage. The witness is not aware as to when the cash was given. After the marriage the accused is alleged to have demanded a car. Sri shankaralingaiah his friend sri srikanth are said to have arranged for the money enabling the accused to buy a car.

20. The witness claims that he used to visit the house of the deceased once in a fortnight. While the witness had visited the house of the deceased she is said to have narrated the cruelty meted out to her by the accused demanding another car. The witness claims to have witnessed the quarrel between the deceased and the accused based on the demand for second car. The mother of the deceased is said to have consoled the deceased. It was C.W.2 who had informed this witness regarding the unfortunate incident. C.W.2 is said to have informed this witness that it was the younger brother of the accused who had informed him of the incident. During the cross examination the improvements were sought to be brought about but the suggestions are found to have been denied by the witness.

21. Now on behalf of the accused a peculiar defence is raised that would again boomerang against him as such defence without basis would lead to an act of cruelty. The defence was that the deceased had developed affinity towards one sri srikanth with whom she intended to marry but based on the differences in their cast the parents of the deceased were against the marriage. P.W.9, sri srikanth is found to have supported the case of the prosecution but during the cross examination although this witness admits the suggestion of having visited the house of C.W.1 on three occasions and even after the marriage of the accused with the deceased this witness used to talk to the deceased. Now this cannot be presumed to be an affair between the two and the intention of the accused behind this question also would make it amply clear that he had suspected the deceased without any grounds.

22. Even the witness P.W.2 is found to have denied of any such intimacy between the deceased and P.W.9. this witness had further made it clear that P.W.9 had not proposed at any point of time to marry the deceased. P.W.1, father of the deceased is found to have exhibited ignorance in respect of these so called developments. The other witnesses and relatives including P.W.17 are found to have clearly denied of any such developments and that the deceased intended to marry P.W.9. therefore this defence although raised by the accused who himself did not believe in its truth is found to have demonstrated an illustration of act of cruelty. The above witnesses are found to have asserted even the demand for car made after the marriage.

23. It could clearly be gathered from the oral account of the above witnesses that after four months of the marriage of the deceased with the accused there was a demand for a car made by the accused. The son of C.W.1, C.W.2 had along with his friends arranged for Rs.2,75,000-00 and Rs.15,000-00 was the quantum of equal monthly installment to be paid by the accused and on this condition car was arranged. The witnesses were cross examined regarding the documents for borrowing and purchase of car. The demand and giving are not legal but contrary to law and therefore one cannot be expected to secure documents for these kind of transaction. As a corollary it would be too absurd to hold that in the absence of the prosecution placing documents the version of the prosecution cannot be believed at all. The mother of the deceased, Smt Kamalamma P.W.3 had narrated during the examination in chief that are said to have been stated for the first time before the court and were improvements.

24. However the witness when cross examined is found to have denied that those statements were made before the court. Be that as it may the investigating officer had failed to record the statement as deposed before the court. They are only the instances of acts of cruelty only. Even if these statements are ignored the prosecution has been able to clearly establish the offences punishable under sections 3 and 4 of the dowry prohibition act and sectoin 498 A of the IPC. The burden would also be on the accused to state as to what transpired within the four walls of the matrimonial house that drove the deceased to commit suicide if at all it was a suicide according to the accused. But unfortunately the accused had failed to account for what actually transpired that was within the knowledge of the accused.

25. The prosecution is therefore successful in establishing the offences of section 3 and 4 of the dowry prohibition act. The deceased has admittedly died be it a suicide or homicide and hence the prosecution has also successfully established the offence punishable under section 498A of the IPC. The prosecution has alleged the offences punishable under sections 304B and 302 of the IPC. The question now to be pondered and probed is whether the offence punishable under section 302 of the IPC is made out from the materials or whether the offence punishable under section 304B of the IPC is made out. Ex.P.7 got marked through P.W.4 first in point of time at 8.15 p.m at 11.02.2013 soon after the incident and registered as udr 7/ 2013. Ex.P.10 is the spot panchanama drawn on 11.02.2013 at the house on 11.02.2013 between 9.15 p.m and 10.45 p.m.

26. P.W.4, Sri H.Chikkanna driver a resident in a building in the vicinity of the building in which the deceased and the accused were residing. He had first seen the smoke oozing out of a house in the third floor. This witness was residing as a tenant and similarly the accused was residing as a tenant in the adjacent building. He claims to have then called the police who had come to the spot and forcibly open the door. The witness claims to have found a female body charred to death. The witness recalls of having seen burnt bed, mat, pillow and clothes. Ex.P.8 and 9 are the photographs taken at the spot. Ex.P.10 is the panchanama drawn at the spot and according to the recitals it would be clear that the door was locked from inside and was an internal lock. There is neither mention of latches and key from outside. Now during the cross examination it is found to have been elicited through this witness that he does neither know writing in Kannada nor to read any script in Kannada.

27. The witness does not also know to read and write in English. However the witness had already deposed regarding what actually he had seen and that is contained in the panchanama. The signatures found on Ex.P.10 and the deposition appear to be of the same person by invoking provisions of section 73 of the indian evidence act. P.W.5, sri nagaraj is also a witness to Ex.P.10 who has similarly deposed regarding his presence at the time of drawing up of panchanama at the spot. P.W.4 had seen the accused who was called by the police to come to the spot. P.W.5 is found to have stated that there was a mobile and charger in the house from which the police had called the accused. However the neither the mobile nor the charger were seized by the police. P.W.6. sri sridhar is a witness to Ex.P.11, inquest panchanama. Ex.P.11 (a) is the signature of the witness.

28. The inquest panchanama was drawn by the tahasildar between 3.00 p.m and 5.00 p.m. the body of the female was completely charred and was without any clothes. P.W.7, Sri Manu.M a postal department employee has to pass through the police station while he is to attend to his duties. On 18.02.2013 while he was going towards satellite bus stand from his house he was called by bytarayanapura police and when he went into the police station he had an occasion of seeing the accused. C.W.10 was present and there he came to know that one smt mangalagowri is the wife of the accused. The accused is said to have led the witnesses and the police officials to pramoda layout. The accused had led the witnesses and the police to the third floor in a building where there were traces of burning. The accused is said to have produced a club that was put in a cloth and sealed.

29. A panchanama was drawn at the spot and the witness claimed to have affixed his signature. Ex.P.12 is the seizure panchanama drawn on 18.02.2013 between 1.00 p.m and 2.00 p.m. Ex.P.12 (a) is the signature of the witness. M.O.8 is the club. The accused is then said to have led them to rajajinagar where he had shown a car parked in front of the house of his friend. The accused had then shown a vehicle tavera and in it were match box and water bottle with diesel. All these are said to have been seized in the presence of the witnesses by drawing up of panchanama. Ex.P.13 is the panchanama and Ex.P.13 (a) is the signature of the witness. Ex.P.13 is the seizure drawn in front of Bhavani Nilaya, 24/ 8, 8th cross ,1st main, 1st N block, rajajinagar. M.O.9 to 11 are the articles seized under this panchanama.

30. Ex.P.14 and 15 are the photographs taken at the time of drawing up of the above panchanamas. During the cross examination it was elicited through this witness that the satellite bus stand is about 5 kms away from his house and he was going on motor cycle. There were houses in the building but those residents were not signatories to the panchanama. This question would be relevant to the investigating officer. Even if the investigating officer had chosen some persons as panch witnesses the question is whether terms could be dictated to the investigating officer to conduct the investigation in a particular manner. The present witness appears to be too independent as he is neither connected to the informant and his family nor the accused and his family. Suggestions are found to have been made to this witness that neither the key was with the accused nor he had opened the lock put to the door.

31. Now this suggestion itself would make it amply clear that an attempt was made by the accused to enter the house stealthily. Although the tavera car may have been parked in the public place but the articles at M.O.9 to 11 and the knowledge of their place is a very material piece of statement and evidence. The accused is found to have nowhere stated that he had the habit of keeping diesel in the house in plastic water bottle. On the contrary Ex.P.22, report from the fsl would reveal that materials collected at the scene of occurrence contained the residue of diesel. If the deceased intended to kill herself or commit suicide and collected diesel in a bottle and keep it in the house what measures had the accused taken to prevent the mishap as the same ought to be within the knowledge of the accused. The accused cannot be heard to plead ignorance in respect of such drastic measures attempted to be taken by the deceased.

32. It is also not the case of the accused that there was some person who intended to kill the deceased if so the purpose for which such intention could be held. Now interestingly and co-incidentally the club, door key and match box were not found with traces of diesel and the plastic bottle with diesel were shown by the accused in the car. If at all the version of the accused was that the deceased had committed suicide the bottle containing diesel and match box ought to be near the scene of occurrence and in a burnt state. However these articles had no traces of diesel and were safe in the car. This would answer all the questions of mystery surrounding the death of the deceased. P.W.8, sri chethan is a driver who is found to have deposed to the effect that he had not at any point of time driven the tavera car. The witness has acquaintances with the accused and he has his own auto rickshaw.

33. In so far as the rest of the story is concerned the witness had not supported the case of the prosecution. The witness was cross examined by the learned p.p on permission. The suggestions made to the witness were all denied by him. Ex P 16 is the contradiction in the previous statement of the witness recorded during the investigation. P.W.14. Sri Nagaraju, retired A.S.I had discharged his duties as head constable in Byatarayanapura Police Station for the period between 2007 and 2013. he had accompanied the mortal remains of the deceased to the hospital and had assisted in the conduct of inquest panchanama and after the autopsy being conducted this witness claims to have handed over the mortal remains to the relatives of the deceased. P.W.15, sri k.b.jayakumar, assistant engineer was working with the public works department for the period between 2012 and 2015.

34. The witness claims to have received requisition to prepare a sketch of the scene of occurrence. Ex.P.17 is the sketch and Ex.P.17 (a) is the signature of the witness. According to this witness one head constable sri kempaiah had shown the spot. There is no endorsement to that effect on Ex.P.17. Ex.P.17 is post mortem report marked with consent. There is no mention of fracture in the scull or any part of the body. All the organs were burnt and charred. Death was on account of burn injuries. P.W.16, sri gaviyappa, head constable had on the instructions submitted the first information report with first information statement to the court on 12.02.2013 at 8.30 p.m. during the cross examination it was elicited through this witness that the distance between the byatarayanapura police station and koramangala police station is about 14-15 kms and this witness did not have a vehicle of his own.

35. Be that as it may only account of this the integrity of this witness cannot be doubted and it is not the case of the accused that there was an inordinate delay in submitting the first information report. P.W.18, sri rangappa claims to have a son by name sri sunil kumar who had two sons, innova and another car. Sri sunil kumar is said to have borrowed loan for purchase of car at the karnataka bank, nonavinakere. The two cars were being run by sri sunil kumar and his younger brother. The witness claims that the tavera car was being sold to the accused who is said to have advanced some money. The accused is said to have agreed to repay the remaining loan amount. Therefore it is clear that the car was possessed by the accused at or about the time of this incident.

36. P.W.21, sri basavaraj is one of the customers who is found to have deposed that they had hired the services of the accused to go to malaya mahadeshwar hills. Rs.4,000-00 is said to have been paid. Ex.P.14 and 15 are the photographs of the tavera car. However this witness does not specifically say as to the time at which and the point from which they started and the time they had returned from mahadeshwara hills. During the cross examination it was elicited that he had visited the police station between 11.00 and 11.30 a.m. apart from that nothing appears to have been elicited that could help the accused in demonstrating alibi. The call record details would show that the presence of the accused in the vicinity at or about the time of the incident and the proposition that the accused could not be traced anywhere in the vicinity of the scene of occurrence could be ruled out.

37. The straw that the accused attempted to clinge upon also is found to be of least assistance to the defence sought to be relied upon by the accused. According to the arrest memo dated 14.02.2013 the accused is shown to be taken to custody by the police on 14.02.2013 at 5.30 p.m. Ex.P.21 is the report of sri krishnamurthy, p.s.i who was deputed to trace and cause arrest of the accused had apprehended the accused near Sri Madduramma Temple at Hanumanthanagar at 4.45 p.m on 14.02.2013 and produced the accused before the sho at 5.30 p.m. the investigating officer had then proceeded to interrogate the accused and had recorded the statement at Ex.P.24. Ex.P.24 (a) is the signature of the witness P.W.23 and Ex.P.24 (b) is the signature of the accused. P.W.20, Sri Duggappa, member, KPSC had discharged duties as a.c.p at the Kengeri Gate Sub Division for the period between 2012 and 2013.

38. He had secured records of this case from C.W.38. on 16.02.2013 he had recorded the statements of C.W.1 to3, 14 to 18 and 21. he had recorded the statement of sri manu and sri nataraj. On 25.02.2013 he had recorded the statement of sri rangappa.on 2.03.2013 he had recorded the statement of sri gopinayak and on 7.03.2013 he had released the tavera car. He had written letter to the fsl requesting the report. He had requested the engineer to prepare a sketch of the spot and had received the same. During the cross examination it was elicited through this witness that statements were improvements and were made for the first time before the court on oath. However on carefully examining the statements that were argued to be improvements are in fact not so material and the statements were made in different manner. Apart from that nothing concrete appears to have been elicited through this witness.

39. The witness was again summoned and examined on 23.11.2024 and it was elicited through that C.W.38 had requested the tahasildar to conduct inquest panchanama. Ex.P.25 is the requisition. Ex.P.25 (a) is the signature of C.W.38. on 11.02.2013 a statement of C.W.4 and registered a udr case. Ex.P.7 is the statement and signature of C.W.38 is at Ex.P.7 (b). Ex.P.26 is the first information report and Ex.P.26 (a) is the signature. Ex.P.27 is the rough sketch prepared at the time of drawing up of panchanama. Ex.P. 28 is the report and 29 is the call detail. Ex.P.30 and 31 are the rent agreement and receipt. Ex.P.32 are the photographs. The cross examination in fact does not discredit the witness. P.W.22, Dr.vani.n is the assistant director of fsl who claims to have examined the articles sent to the laboratory and had given the report at Ex.P.22 and 23.

40. The signature of this witness are at Ex.P.22 (a) and 23 (a). the articles examined are at M.O.1 to 11. the witness was not cross examined by the accused. P.W.23, Sri Ravi P.I had discharged duties at Byatarayanapura police station between 13.02.2013 and 15.02.2013. the witness claims to have deputed personnel for tracing the accused and to produce him. The accused was produced before this witness on 14.02.2013. the witness had recorded statements of the witnesses C.W.19 to 22, 31, 33 to 35. again the witness was recalled and it was elicited through this witness that on the accused being produced statement of the accused was recorded at Ex.P.24. Ex.P.24 (a) and (b) are the signatures of this witness and that of the accused. Ex.P.21 is the report of the personnel who had traced the accused and produced before this witness. The cross examination refers to only denial of the process of the investigation.

41. Therefore there is nothing to disbelieve the version of this witness. The presumption U/s.113B of Indian Evidence Act is available to the prosecution, which is not rebutted by the accused. The principles in the judgments relied upon are followed in so far as facts in this case is concerned. Considering the competency of the investigating officer, time constraints, availability of resources he has done what could be done. To sum up, the prosecution has successfully established the case against the accused. The conduct, motive and mentality of the accused prior to and after the incident is enough to hold that, he has committed the offences charged against him. Hence, Point No.1 is answered in the 'Affirmative'.

42. Point No.3 : With these discussions, I proceed to pass the following:

ORDER Acting under Sec.235(2) of Cr.P.C., the accused is hereby convicted for the offences punishable under Sections 498A, 302, 304B of IPC and Sec.3 & 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act.
To hear on sentence.

ORDER REGARDING SENTENCE I have heard both regarding the sentence. The learned prosecutor has submitted that accused is held guilty for an offence punishable Sec. 302 of IPC. She requested maximum punishment and maximum fine in view of the barbarity with which the consequences of death was committed.
2. Heard and perused the records. Under the circumstances, the court is left with the following option:

2. The fact of the case:

The accused married the deceased Nisha on 06.03.2011 at Thuraiyur. After marriage, they lived at the accused house Velayudhampalayam, thereafter, went to Coimbatore and lived separately. On 11.04.2011 the accused and the deceased Nisha went to Singapore to purchase machineries for the purpose of their business. For that, the accused demanded money and sent the deceased to get Rs.5,00,000/- from her father viz., Perumal and the father of the deceased Perumal gave that amount. After some time, since he was not able to get any job and to start business, the accused again demanded a further amount of Rs.5,00,000/- for business purposes and he again went to Singapore and treated her https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis cruelty over phone. Thereafter, he had again tortured Nisha suspecting relationship with her sister's husband. Due to the humiliation caused by the accused, she committed suicide on 04.11.2012 at her residence by hanging herself. Thereafter, her father Perumal gave the complaint Ex.P1. After that, Revenue Divisional Officer conducted enquiry and on receipt of the complaint, the respondent police registered a complaint in Crime No.1355 of 2012 under Section 174 Cr.P.C. and Section 498(A) IPC. After completion of investigation, filed a final report and prosecuted the accused for the offence punishable under Sections 498(A) & 304(B) IPC.
3.Before the trial Court, the prosecution examined twenty one witnesses and marked twenty three documents besides produced two material objects.


4.When the incriminating materials were put to the accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C., the accused denied the same as false, he did not choose to examine any witness nor mark any documents. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

5.After considering the evidence, the trial Court found not guilty for the offence under Section 304(B) IPC but convicted for the offence under Section 498A IPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years besides imposed a fine of Rs.2,00,000/- in default to undergo three months simple imprisonment and ordered to pay a fine amount to the girl child of the deceased after appeal time is over. Aggrieved by this judgment of conviction, the accused filed this criminal appeal.

6.The learned counsel for the appellant would submit that the finding of the trial Court is unsustainable either in law and on facts and contrary to the evidence on record. The trial Court recorded its finding that the prosecution had failed to let in positive and cogent evidence with regard to the cruelty for commission of suicide by the deceased and acquitted the accused for the charge under Section 304 B IPC but erroneously convicted for the offence under Section 498 A IPC in the absence of any evidence for demanding of dowry. Further, the learned counsel contended that the accused demanded dowry through phone from https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Singapore and thereby caused cruelty to his wife but the investigating officer had not seized the mobile phone of the deceased wife Nisha in order to establish the fact that through phone from Singapore, he demanded Rs.5,00,000/- from the deceased wife. The investigating officer during his cross examination admitted this fact that he had not seized the mobile phone of the deceased wife Nisha. The trial Court failed to consider this fact and evidence of the investigating officer and failed to consider the non-production of best evidence by the prosecution. The trial Court erroneously relied upon the family quarrel at the naming ceremony of their child Anjana, which was not mentioned in the FIR but only later during the course of trial, the father deposed about the family quarrel which is unconnected with the demanding of dowry as alleged by the prosecution. Further, the trial Court failed to consider the evidence PW18 Dhanalakshmi, a neighbour to the deceased. Further, in this case, the complaint was given belatedly on the next day on 05.11.2012 at about 8.00 a.m. but PW17 in his evidence stated that the death initiation had been prepared by 10.00p.m. on 04.11.2012. While so, the trial Court has failed https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis to appreciate the evidence of PW18 that the police arrived at the house of the deceased in the night. In such circumstances, the complaint of PW1 alleged to have been given next day at 8.00 a.m. without any explanation for the delay becomes unbelievable, highly doubtful. Further, the learned counsel contended that PW18 the RDO, who conducted the inquest has deposed that the sister of the deceased Subalatha and her brother first saw the deceased in her house. They were not examined by the RDO. Therefore, the presence of PW3 becomes doubtful. Further, the trial Court failed to consider the fact that at the time of the alleged occurrence, the accused was at Singapore and he came to the native place immediately on the receipt of the information about the death of his wife and attended the further enquiries and the trial Court failed to consider the fact and the report of RDO that in inquest report column 15, the death has not been mentioned due to dowry demand. In such circumstances, the finding of guilt for the offence under Section 498A IPC is unsustainable and reiterated other grounds raised in the grounds of appeal. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

7.To support his argument, the learned counsel for the appellant relied upon the judgments (i). Mangat Ram vs State Of Haryana reported in 2014 (12) SCC 595, (ii).Harbeer Singh Vs. Shheshpal & Ors, reported in 2016 (16) SCC 418 and (iii) Amish Devgan vs Union Of India reported in 2020 7 SCC 637.


8.The learned Government Advocate (Crl.side) for the respondent supported the judgment of the trial Court and pleaded to dismiss the criminal appeal as it has no merit.


9.I have considered the matter in the light of the submissions made by the learned counsel for the appellant as well as the learned counsel for the respondent.


10.This is a case of dowry death. Nisha is the wife of the appellant /accused. The marriage took place on 06.03.2011 at Thuraiyur. They have a daughter named Anjana. The wife of the appellant namely Nisha https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis committed suicide on 04.11.2012. Dr.Jayakavitha PW13 and Dr.Rasiq Pareeth conducted post mortem upon the body of the deceased Nisha and gave post mortem certificate Ex.P5. They deposed that the deceased, who appears to have died of asphyxia due to hanging. Thus, it is established that she committed suicide.


11.I have gone through the impugned judgment of the prosecution evidence. Though PW1 Perumal father of the deceased deposed that he had given Rs.5,00,000/- to the accused in the presence of PW8 Veeramani and PW9 Kumaran @ Ganankumaran, they have not subjected for cross examination, hence, the trial Court had not taken into consideration of their evidence. Further, with regard to the second demand of Rs.5,00,000/-, it is alleged that the accused asked for that amount, while he was in Singapore through phone. Further, the evidence of PW1 Perumal, PW2 Madheswari and PW3 Selvi Subalatha reveals the fact that the accused was in Singapore at the time of occurrence. Further, it is alleged that he demanded the amount of Rs.5,00,000/- from his wife Nisha only by phone. The investigating officer has not recovered the mobile phone used by the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis deceased and took the call details to find out whether there was a continuous phone calls from the accused soon before the commission of the suicide but the investigating officer failed to secure the phone and obtained the details from the phone. It is not evidenced before the trial Court to establish the allegation that the accused demanded Rs.5,00,000/- to the deceased wife before the occurrence from Singapore through phone.

12.Further, on perusal of the report of Revenue Divisional Officer, Sugumar Ex.P19, it is noticed in that the column 15 of the report, the commission of suicide was not mentioned due to demand of dowry. The words run as follows:

                                       “””Fw;wtpay;          eilKiwr;rl;lk;        gphpt[

                                       bjhptpj;Jf;bfhs;fpnwhk;/””







https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis





13.Further, the trial Court in the impugned judgment in para – 18, it is noticed that the trial Judge recorded the vast contradiction between the final report and the evidence of PW1 to PW3 as to the demand of dowry by the accused to the deceased in spite of this observation and contradiction, with the evidence of PW1 to PW3 found guilty for the offence under Section 498A is unacceptable one. The relevant portion of the judgment runs as follows:


“The investigating officer had not seized the deceased phone and made efforts to collect the call details to find out whether there was a call from the accused the previous night as stated by the PW1 to PW3. Further more there seems to be vast contradiction between the final report and the evidence of PW1 to PW3 as to the demand of dowry by the accused to the deceased. The primary evidence required for proving 304 B Indian Penal Code is the demand of dowry and the cruelty in continuation to demand of dowry. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis But this Court finds that the prosecution had failed to let in positive and cogent evidence that there was a demand of dowry by the accused through deceased before the date of death.”
14.It is a cardinal rule in law of evidence that the best available evidence should be brought before the Court under Sections 60, 64 and 91 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, are based on this rule. In this case, in weighing the prosecution evidence, the court takes note of the fact that the best available evidence of the mobile phone of the deceased Nisha has not been secured in order to establish the demand of dowry by the accused from Singapore. The main allegation is, from Singapore, he demanded dowry of Rs.5,00,000/- from the deceased wife, it is not established by the prosecution.


15.In this case, there is absolutely no evidence of dowry demand and the conviction recorded under Section 498A IPC is without any material. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

16.Explanation to Section 498A IPC gives the meaning of “cruelty“ which consists of two clauses. To attract Section 498A IPC, the prosecution has to establish the willful conduct on the part of the accused and that the conduct is of such a nature as is likely to drive the wife to commit suicide.


17.The trial Court failed to take note of the fact that the accused was in Singapore at the relevant period. The allegation is attributed that he insisted on the demand of Rs.5,00,000/- only through a phone that was not established by the prosecution. Further, the trial Court has found no offence under Section 304 B IPC but convicted under Section 498A IPC without any material to establish the demand of dowry. Therefore, the judgment of the trial Court is unsustainable and the same has to be set aside. The accused is entitled for acquittal.

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

18.In the result, the criminal appeal is allowed and the conviction and sentence passed by the Trial Court is hereby set aside and the appellant/accused is acquitted from all the charges. Fine amount, if any, paid by the appellant/accused to be refunded to him.

(PER : HONOURABLE MS. JUSTICE GITA GOPI)

1. The Death Certificate of respondent No.3-Kamlaben W/o. Pratapgiri Goswami, who died on 18.11.2023, is produced by learned advocate Mr. Raxit J.Dholakia, which is ordered to be taken on record. Since, respondent No.3 died, the appeal qua her stands abated.

NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/883/2003 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2025 undefined

2. The challenge under Section 378(1)((3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 is given to the judgment and order dated 07.03.2003 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge (Fast Track Court) Jamnagar in Sessions Case No.138 of 2002. The learned Trial Court Judge acquitted the four accused from the charge under sections 498A, 306, 304B read with section 114 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and sections 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. The learned Trial Court Judge gave benefit of doubt to the accused while acquitting them.

3. The case, as alleged against the accused is of dowry death along with instigation to the deceased for committing suicide. The marriage of the deceased along with accused No.1 was performed on 07.04.2002 in a 'Samuh Lagna', which was organized by the representative of the community. The allegation, as has been alleged against the accused is of demanding gold chain and finger ring as a dowry. The charge at Exh.6 framed on 03.10.2002 notes that the marriage span was of 18 days and the charge of physical and mental cruelty has also been framed against all the accused for charging them under section 498A read with section 114 of I.P.C. The deceased had committed suicide on 25.04.2002 in the matrimonial house at about 4.00 in the afternoon, therefore, against all the accused the charge under section 306 along with section 114 of I.P.C. has been invoked. Further, since the marriage span was of 18 days and the deceased had committed suicide by inflaming herself on 25.04.2002 and the cause of the suicide is attributed to dowry demand, thus, all NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/883/2003 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2025 undefined the accused have been charged under section 304B read with section 114 of I.P.C.

4. Learned APP Mr. Utkarsh Sharma appearing for the appellant State submitted that the prosecution need not prove any of the charges since the presumption under section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 could have been drawn, as the marriage span is only of 18 days. Learned APP submitted that the provision in the India Evidence Act, 1872 itself is sufficient for the prosecution to place in service the case against all the accused, where further evidence would not be required. Learned APP further submitted that even otherwise the evidence of the father as well as the sister along with the FIR proves on record that the deceased committed suicide because of the harassment, which amounts to cruelty, as there was dowry demand from all the family members.

5. Learned APP Mr. Utkarsh Sharma referring to the evidence of the father as well as the sister submitted that the deceased immediately, prior to her death, had informed them about the dowry demand by the accused, which itself would be sufficient evidence for corroboration on record that the death was owing to demand made by the accused for the gold chain and finger ring.

6. Learned advocate Mr. Raxit J.Dholakia appearing for the respondents accused has submitted that the cause of the death could not be gathered from the evidence on record, since there would not be any question of dowry demand, as the marriage had been performed in 'Samuh Lagna', where NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/883/2003 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2025 undefined the parties are bound by the condition of the community members. Learned advocate Mr. Dholaka has referred to the documents Exh.26 to 29 on record to fortify the fact that the conditions for the marriage were known to both the parties, and has further stated that the community members had given gifts during the marriage and no further demand could be made by any of the person, who had consented for the marriage within the community.

7. Learned advocate Mr. Dholakia has further stated that the delay of five days in filing the F.I.R. has not been sufficiently explained. The complaint has not been filed in Kalavad Police Station while has been given in the office of Dy.S.P., which also creates doubt since two of the nephews of the complainant are working in police department at Jamnagar. Mr. Dholakia further submitted that the deceased prior to the death had also telephonically called her father, who could not attain the call and the conduct of the father itself becomes doubtful when he had not made a further call in response inquiring from his own daughter the cause of the call. Mr. Dholaka further submitted that there were many opportunities to the father within those 18 days to put a complaint before the community member, if there were any dowry demand from the family members of the deceased.

8. Learned advocate Mr. Dholakia has also raised concern about the blood stains, which were found at the place of the death, and submitted that the police has not made any investigation regarding the blood stains, which was seen in the room of the deceased, and further referring to the NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/883/2003 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2025 undefined Panchnama has stated that the place, where the deceased committed had suicide, wherein out of the two doors one was facing the market. Mr. Dholakia stated that further investigation could have revealed a detail fact to come to a conclusion about the cause of committing suicide.

9. We have perused the impugned judgment and order passed by the learned Trial Court as well as the evidence of the witnesses. The learned Trial Court Judge has referred to the evidence of the witnesses. The observation, as recorded notes that on 25.04.2002, the deceased at about 4.00 in the afternoon had committed suicide by pouring Kerosene on herself. The accidental death was recorded as Accident Death No.11/2002 and the information regarding the incident was given at 17:30 hours at the Police Station. Initially, the investigation started for accidental death. The father of the deceased had visited the Hospital, where P.S.I. Shri Vank and two other police fellows were present, who had inquired from the father about the relationship. The learned Trial Court Judge has observed the conduct of the father being strange, as though he met the police in the Hospital, he had not informed about the cruelty, as alleged of dowry demands. The learned Judge thus, observed that this was the first opportunity, which was to the complainant Mayagiri to inform the police about the cause of death, when the prosecution alleges to be the dowry death. Further, the complaint, which came to be filed after five days of the incident, could not be specifically explained. The father in his deposition has deposed that because of the death of his daughter, he was NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/883/2003 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2025 undefined mentally disturbed, therefore, there was a delay of five days. The learned Judge did not find this explanation to be believable observing that the incident had taken place on 25.04.2002 and the complaint was given on 29.04.2002 at 17:30 hours before the Dy.S.P. Shri Pande.

10. Learned advocate Mr. Dholakia has submitted that though the police was available at the Hospital, no complaint was given by the father. Thereafter too, no complaint has been given at Kalavad Police Station and directly they had approached Dy. S.P. Shri Pande, where actually the complaint was to be recorded before the Police Station. Thus, has been rightly observed by the learned Trial Court Judge, as non- explained.

10.1 The father had all the support of the nephews, who were working in the police department and would have been informed about the procedure. The learned Trial Court Judge has also recorded about those facts that it would be very difficult to accept that the father was not in a mental condition to give the complaint, where the fatal effect delay in giving the F.I.R. was very well known to the two nephews, who are working in the police department.

11. The learned Trial Court Judge has also observed that the statements recorded by the Kalavad Police Station were not brought on record and the learned Judge, thus, has noted that the prosecution has withheld the statement of the complainant. It is required to be noted that the Accident Death No.11/2002 was recorded by Kalavad Police Station and NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/883/2003 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2025 undefined on the basis of that complaint, the police Shri Vank and other police had approached the Hospital. The statements of the father and even the mother had been recorded, but those statements have not been brought on record, which could have thrown light on the actual facts stated by the complainant immediately after the incident, this would create doubt on the prosecution case.

12. The learned Trial Court Judge has also further observed that the evidence are only of the family members, while the incident had taken place at matrimonial house, which is at Khodiyar, which is a residential area. In spite of that, no evidence or statement of the neighbours or nearby people though recorded, have not been shown in the charge-sheet. Thus, the learned Trial Court Judge has raised suspicion in his observation regarding the investigation.

13. The sister of the deceased, Daxaben Ratan Giri was examined as P.W.5 at Exh.31. She in her deposition has stated about the date of marriage. She stated that on the next day, as per the customs of the family both, the daughter as well as the son-in-law were invited to visit the parental house. She has stated that in the 'Samuh Lagna', the gifts were given. The deposition notes that the deceased Meenaxiben stated that her both her parents-in-law had asked for the gold chain and a finger ring for the son-in-law. The witness also stated that two younger brothers-in-law had also come to take them back and they too had also asked this witness that their parents have demanded gold chain and a finger ring for the son-in-law. She stated that the bride and the bridegroom had visited her NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/883/2003 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2025 undefined house approximately after 12 days of the marriage. She stated that during the lunch hour, the son-in-law i.e. accused No.1 had also demanded gold chain and a finger ring and thereafter she came to know that Meenaxi died by inflaming herself. The witness also stated that she could not tell the cause of the death.

14. In the cross-examination, she has stated that her father resides at a distance of 5 to 6 Kms. She was at the parental house, where both the younger brothers-in-law had come to take the bride and bridegroom back. The strange thing, which requires to be noted that, after 12 days of marriage, the allegation was of demand, which was termed as dowry demand of gold chain and a finger ring, but from the parental house neither the father nor the witness Daxaben as a sister had complained before any community member or any of the members, who had conducted the 'Samuh Lagna'. The marriage of witness - Daxaben was also held in 'Samuh Lagna' earlier. Thus, the sister as well as the father of the deceased would be well aware about the procedure and the system adopted by the community for those entering into the marriage in the community function of 'Samuh Lagna'. The learned Trial Court Judge has noted this fact and has referred to the documents at Exh.26 to 29 regarding the conditions of the community with regard to dowry, where the community is totally against any such dowry demands. The learned Trial Court Judge has, thus, rightly observed that, had there been any dowry demand, there would have been immediate complaint before the community members.

NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/883/2003 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2025 undefined

15. Further it is required to be mentioned that two nephews of the complainant are working in the police department. The statements, which were recorded of the complainant and others after the Accidental Death Entry No.11/2002, have not come on record. What was the immediate statements of the witnesses have not been brought and proved by the prosecution. The complaint was recorded by Dy. S.P. Shri Pande, where the corroboration could have been brought on record by bringing the statements recorded after the accidental death inquiry. The neighbours, who are residing near the matrimonial house of the deceased could have mentioned about the matrimonial relation between the husband and the wife and the family members, and could have also described the place of offence, where the girl has committed suicide. The major lacuna in the investigation is from where the deceased had procured Kerosene to commit suicide.

16. The allegation, which has been attributed to the mother- in-law was that, she had stated to the deceased after the marriage that if she would stay as a daughter, she would be happy, but if she would treat herself as a daughter-in-law, then she would remain unhappy. Such a statement has been analysed by the learned Trial Court Judge observing that theses are the words often stated by the mother-in-law at the time of marriage. It would be necessary to observe that it is generally customary for the mother-in-law to state expecting that the daughter-in-law would conduct herself as a daughter of the family. Such words of the mother-in-law, as rightly NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/883/2003 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2025 undefined observed by the learned Trial Court Judge, cannot be attributed as cruelty after the marriage. And such a bare instance cannot be considered as forming an act of willful conduct to drive the woman to commit suicide.

17. The learned Trial Court Judge has referred to the judgment in case of, State of Gujarat Vs. Sunilkumar Kanaiyalal Jani, (1996) 2 GLR 797, in regard to the solitary incident would not bring the said fact into aspect of cruelty or harassment under section 498A of I.P.C. The learned Trial Court Judge has relied on the judgment of Sunilkumar (supra), to observe that:

""Merely the fact that husband was treating the wife with cruelty would not be sufficient to establish abetment. Prosecution to prove compelling or alarming circumstances as leaving the victim with no option but to commit suicide. There must also be knowledge and intention relating to crime and proximate. The case in general terms is not sufficient here in this case on the day of the incident, what was the issue, who initiated the quarrel, in what context both were quarreling and who was at fault for the quarrel.""
18. The statement of the mother-in-law of accepting the daughter-in-law to conduct herself as a daughter being a solitary incident and further observing the fact that it is a customary way of welcoming the daughters-in-law. The learned Trial Court Judge has rightly not considered the same as cruelty.

19. Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 deals with the presumption as to dowry death. It is has been provided that soon before the death, it should be proved that the woman had been subjected to cruelty or harassment or in connection with, any demand for dowry. Then, the Court could NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/883/2003 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2025 undefined presume that such person had caused the dowry death. There must be material on record to show that soon before the death of the woman, such woman was subjected to cruelty or harassment, or such cruelty or harassment was in connection with demand of dowry, then only a presumption can be drawn that the person has committed offence inducing the deceased for a dowry death. Reliance can be placed on the case of G.V. Siddaramesh Vs. State of Karnataka, (2010) 3 SCC 152. The words ""soon before"" in section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act cannot be limited by fixing time limit. Such aspect has to be determined by the Court appreciating the facts and circumstances on record.

20. It has been very vehemently urged by learned APP Mr. Sharma that 18 days of marriage span could itself be a sufficient evidence on record to presume dowry death, but as observed in the case of Kailash Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 2007 SC 107, such determination is for the Court to appreciate on the basis of facts and circumstances to conclude that the deceased was ""soon before"" the death subjected to cruelty or harassment for any purpose or in connection with dowry demand.

21. Here, in the present case, the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the fact that immediately before the death, the deceased was subjected to any cruelty. There is no complaint before any community members or any other members of the society about the dowry demand or any other cruelty or harassment, as alleged subjected to the deceased. Though, the father and the sister of the deceased had opportunity to NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/883/2003 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2025 undefined complaint before the community members, however, they had not preferred to do so. The very fact, which becomes glaring in the present case is that the statement recorded by Kalavad Police Station in connection with the accidental death entry has not been brought on record to corroborate the statements which had been recorded by Jamnagar Police. The learned Trial Court Judge, thus, has rightly noted that the prosecution has failed to discharge the initial onus of proving the cruelty.

22. The learned Trial Court Judge has relied on the judgment of Basappa Dattu Hegade Vs. State of Karnataka, 1994 Criminal Law Journal 1602, wherein it is held that, the presumption for abetment of suicide by husband or the accused can only be drawn when the prosecution has discharged the initial onus of proving cruelty. The learned Trial Court Judge has also referred to the judgment in case of Ravindra Pyarelal Bildan and Others, Vs. State of Maharashtra,1993 Criminal Law Journal 3019, to observe as under:

""If cruelty is by itself established and the fact of suicide is also established; it would not be sufficient to bring home the guilt of committing cruelty as defined in explanation(a). A reasonable nexus has to be established between the cruelty and the suicide in order to make good the offence of cruelty. Alternatively, the cruelty established has to be of such a gravity as is likely to drive a woman to commit suicide. If suicide is established, it has further to be established that it was of sufficient gravity so as to lead a reasonable person placed in similar circumstances to commit suicide.""
23. The learned Trial Court Judge thus, has rightly referred to the judgment to observe that a reasonable nexus has to be established between the cruelty and the suicide in order to NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/883/2003 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2025 undefined make good offence of cruelty. Alternatively, it has to be established that the cruelty meted out to the deceased were such a grave nature that would have been likely to drive the woman to commit suicide. Here, the suicide has been established, but further it was required for the prosecution to establish that the cruelty alleged was sufficient to consider as grave to lead her to a circumstance, where the deceased would have no other alternative except to commit suicide. Here, this factum of the evidence has not been proved and the learned Trial Court Judge has rightly appreciated the provisions of section 304B read with section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, where the initial burden of proving the presumption has not been discharged. Thus, the question of rebuttal would not arise.

24. Further fact, which goes along with the evidence on record is the inordinate delay in filing the FIR. The father of the deceased had enough time to file the FIR. He immediately had occasion to met the police at the Hospital, but had failed to give any complaint regarding the dowry demand or the cruelty, while the report was of accidental death. The fact, which could draw the attention was that the deceased was taken to the matrimonial home for the last rites and the parents had also joined in-laws in the performance of the after death rituals, which itself shows that the father of the deceased had no such grievance at that relevant time against the in-laws of the deceased. All these relevant facts, which have been brought on record during the trial, could only lead to the conclusion that the FIR so registered, is an NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/883/2003 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2025 undefined afterthought. The facts, as have been alleged, could not be proved during the course of the trial. The cause of the death, as stated was on account of dowry demand, could not be proved nor any cruelty of a grievous nature could be proved by the prosecution.

25. The learned Trial Court Judge has rightly appreciated the evidence on record and the acquittal, as has been ordered by way of the judgment is appropriate. No interference is required in the judgment of acquittal. Thus, we find that this appeal lacks merits and hence, the same stands dismissed.

26. In light of the above, the appeal stands dismissed. Record & Proceedings be sent back to the concerned Trial Court forthwith.

:ORDER  
This criminal original petition has been filed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., praying to call for the records in C.C.No.57 of 2008 on the file of Judicial Magistrate No.2, Dindigul and quash the same as against the petitioners, who are arrayed as A2 and A3 in this case.

2.It is averred in the petition that the petitioners along with others have been charge sheeted for the offence under Section 498(A), 406, 347 and 506(i) read with 109 of I.P.C., and Section 4 of D.P.Act. The defacto complainant is the wife of first accused. The petitioners are second and third accused in the case and they are not related either to the complainant or to the first accused. Except these petitioners, other accused are husband and in-laws of the defacto complainant. The allegations in the charge sheet are demand and acceptance of dowry and also that the defacto complainant was wrongfully confined for about 41 days. Absolutely, there is no iota of allegations as against the petitioners. Entire allegations of the complaint were made only after filing H.M.O.P.No.203 of 2008 by the first accused. The allegation against the first petitioner is that he was conducting poojas during the midnight along with A1. The allegation against the second petitioner is that she was appointed as staff nurse in the clinic of A1 and she was taken along with the family members of the first accused including the defacto complainant in several circumstances including going for picnic. The petitioners have been unnecessarily roped as accused. Entire evidence collected during investigation does not make out a case against the petitioner. Therefore, the proceedings as against the petitioners are liable to be quashed.

3.The learned counsel for the petitioners contends that the petitioners are not relatives to either the defacto complainant or her husband, the first accused; that complaint has been lodged making allegations only subsequent to the filing of the divorce petition by husband/A1; that the statements recorded during investigation under Section 161(3) of Cr.P.C., do not make out a case as against the petitioners and therefore, the proceedings as against the petitioners are to be quashed.

4.The learned Government Advocate (criminal side), per contra, contends that as per the statements of witnesses, offences alleged as against the petitioners are clearly made out and therefore, the criminal original petition is to be dismissed.

5.The learned counsel for the petitioners cited several judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and contended that the petitioners are not relatives and therefore, they are not liable to be prosecuted. Further, it is also contended that no offence as alleged is made out.

6.There is no representation on behalf of the second respondent.

7.The argument of the learned counsel for the petitioners are two folds: viz, (i)since the petitioners do not come within the ambit of relatives of husband as contemplated under Section 498-A of I.P.C., the said offence as against them are not attracted and (ii) as per the statement of witnesses, the offence as alleged are not made out as against the petitioners.

8.In the case in Vijet Gajra V. State (NCT of Delhi) reported in (2010)11 SCC 618, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as follows in paras 11 to 13:

?11.Shri U.U. Lalit, Learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the appellant argued that in U. Suvetha v. State By Inspector of Police & Anr. [(2009) 6 SCC 757], it was specifically held that in order to be covered under Section 498A, IPC one has to be a `relative' of the husband by blood, marriage or adoption. He pointed out that the present appellant was not in any manner a `relative' as referred to in Section 498A, IPC and, therefore, there is no question of any allegation against her in respect of the ill- treatment of the complainant. The Court in this case examined the ingredients of Section 498A, IPC and noting the specific language of the Section and the Explanation thereof came to the conclusion that the word `relative' would not include a paramour or concubine or so.
12.Relying on the dictionary meaning of the word `relative' and further relying on R. Ramanatha Aiyar's Advance Law Lexicon, Volume 4, 3rd Edition, the Court went on to hold that Section 498A, IPC being a penal provision would deserve strict construction and unless a contextual meaning is required to be given to the statute, the said statute has to be construed strictly. On that behalf the Court relied on the judgment in T. Ashok Pai v. CIT [(2007) 7 SCC 162]. A reference was made to the decision in Shivcharan Lal Verma & Anr.
v. State of M.P. [(2007) 15 SCC 369]. After quoting from various decisions of this Court, it was held that reference to the word `relative' in Section 498A, IPC would be limited only to the blood relations or the relations by marriage.

13.Relying heavily on this, Shri Lalit contended that there is no question of any trial of the appellant for the offence under Section 498A, IPC. The argument is undoubtedly correct, though opposed by the Learned Counsel appearing for the State. We are of the opinion that there will be no question of her prosecution under Section 498A, IPC. Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the complainant, Shri Soli J. Sorabjee, also did not seriously dispute this proposition. Therefore, we hold that the FIR insofar as it concerned Section 498A, IPC, would be of no consequence and the appellant shall not be tried for the offence under Section 498A, IPC.?

Therefore, as per the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the word ?relative? in Section 498-A of IPC would be limited only to the blood relations or the relations by marriage. In this case on hand, the petitioners herein are neither blood relations nor the relations by marriage. Therefore, the offence under Section 498-A of IPC is not attracted as against them.

10.The other offences alleged to have been committed by the petitioners are under Sections 406, 347 and 506(i) read with 109 of IPC and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. In this case, the petitioners, who are arrayed as A2 and A3 seem to be the route cause for the entire episode of the matrimonial dispute and the alleged crime as could be seen from the statements of witnesses. As per the statement of witnesses, the first petitioner is arrayed as A2, who took the husband/A1 for poojas during midnights and he also caused cruelty to the defacto complainant by demanding to get the share of the property from the parents of the defacto complainant. It is also stated that he along with her husband took the jewels and property including the amount from the house. As far as the second petitioner/A3 is concerned, it is also stated by witnesses that she along with A1, after consuming liquor, beat the defacto complainant and tortured her. Further, it is stated that she had not only been residing in a room in the house, but, it is also alleged that A1 has been living with A3 as husband and wife.

11.This Court also perused the statements of witnesses. This Court is of the view that there are materials to proceed as against the petitioners with respect to the offences charge sheeted except the offence under Section 498-A of IPC as against the petitioners.

12.For the aforesaid reasons, this Court invoking the inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., quashes the proceedings in C.C.No.57 of 2008 on the file of Judicial Magistrate No.2, Dindigul, with respect to the offence under Section 498-A of IPC as against the petitioners. The proceedings with respect to other offences are directed to be proceeded with by the Judicial Magistrate.

13.Accordingly, this criminal original petition is partly allowed, by quashing the proceedings in C.C.No.57 of 2008 on the file of Judicial Magistrate No.2, Dindigul with respect to the offence under Section 498-A of IPC alone against the petitioners. The learned Judicial Magistrate is directed to proceed with the trial with respect to all other offences, excepting the offence under Section 498-A of IPC against the petitioners. The learned Judicial Magistrate is further directed to dispose of the case, within three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order and report to the registry. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed.

(PER : HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE A.S. SUPEHIA)

1. The present appeal is filed under Section 378(1)(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short ""the Cr.P.C."") against the judgement and order passed in Sessions Case No.99 of 2006 dated 16.09.2006 by the learned Presiding Officer, 7th Fast Track Court, Nadiad, wherein and whereby all the accused were acquitted for the offences punishable under Sections 306, 498A, 304B and 114 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short ""the IPC"") and Section 4 of the Prevention of Dowry Act, 1961 (for short ""the Dowry Act"").

NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/2277/2006 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2025 undefined

2. The case of the prosecution in nutshell and as per the Charge at Exh.1 is that the deceased, who was the daughter of PW-8-Govindbhai Sanabhai, committed suicide on 11.02.2006 at around 18:00 hrs. due to demand of Rs.10,000/- by the accused and also physical as well as mental harassment meted out to her.

3. The complaint dated 12.02.2006 at Exh.19 has been registered by the uncle of the deceased (brother of PW-8). It is alleged in the F.I.R. that the accused used to demand Rs.10,000/- from the deceased and also she was physically assaulted as well as mentally harassed, which ultimately led her to take extreme step of committing suicide. The trial Court, after examining 11 witnesses as well as documentary evidence, has acquitted the accused from the offence.

4. Learned APP Ms.Shah has submitted that the impugned judgement and order passed by the trial Court is required to be quashed and set aside as the trial Court has failed to appreciate a very important aspect that the deceased had committed suicide within a span of 2 years from her marriage and hence, presumption under Section 113A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (for short ""the Evidence Act"") ought to have been drawn against the accused. She has referred to the NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/2277/2006 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2025 undefined testimony of 3 important witnesses i.e. (i) PW-7- complainant (uncle of the deceased) viz. Ishwarbhai Sanabhai, who is examined at Exh.18,

(ii) PW-8-father of the deceased viz. Govindbhai Sanabhai, who is examined at Exh.20; and (iii) PW-9-mother of the deceased viz. Revaben Govindbhai, who is examined at Exh.21. She has submitted that the evidence of all these witnesses corroborate with the facts and it emerges from their evidence that the accused used to harass the deceased by demanding Rs.10,000/- as dowry and also physically assaulted her. Thus, it is urged that the judgement and order of acquittal passed by the trial Court may be quashed and set aside.

5. We have examined the evidence threadbare and the judgement and order passed by the trial Court acquitting the respondent-accused. It is the case of the prosecution, as per the charge at Exh.1, that the deceased, who is the daughter of PW-8-Govindbhai Sanabhai and PW-9-Revaben Govindbhai, committed suicide on 11.02.2006 at 18:00 hrs. by plunging into a well at the village of the accused due to harassment meted out to her, both physically and mentally and also due to demand of Rs.10,000/- as dowry from her.

6. The F.I.R. is registered on 12.02.2006 by the uncle of the deceased (brother of PW-8). He has NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/2277/2006 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2025 undefined categorically stated that for the initial first year, the accused did not harass the deceased, but after a lapse of 1 year, they have started harassing her and demanded Rs.10,000/- from her parents. It is alleged that the accused also physically assaulted the deceased and accordingly, she returned at her parental home twice, but she was sent back by him and her father. He has stated in the complaint that he was informed about the incident by the accused No.1-husband of the deceased that the deceased, who went to gather grass from the field in the morning at 10:00 hrs., but did not return till 17:00 hrs. and hence, all of them went to search her and near a well, they found cut grass and scythe as well as slippers however, they were unable to find out her, and hence they returned. Thereafter, in the morning i.e. on 12.02.2006, when they again saw in the well, they found the dead body lying in the well and, accordingly he has registered the F.I.R..

7. From the cross-examination of PW-7- complainant (uncle of the deceased), it is elicited that after the incident had occurred, his family members had deliberated upon the incident and accordingly, it was decided to register the F.I.R. against in-laws of the deceased and thereafter, the F.I.R. of demand of Rs.10,000/- was registered by them. It is further NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/2277/2006 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2025 undefined elicited from him that relationship between the accused No.1 i.e. husband and the deceased was very cordial and on the contrary, the accused No.1 used to work in the factory and was earning well. The cross-examination was also done with regard to the scene of offence i.e. well and from his deposition, it is elicited that there was no fencing of the well and the land (field) was at the level of the well. Thus, from his deposition, it is manifest that well, which was situated in the field, was not having any boundary/ fencing and it was at the level of the field, and there was surrounding grass. From the deposition of this witness, it is established that relationship between the accused No.1 and the deceased was cordial and there was no harassment meted out to her.

8. The very first statement made by PW-8-father of the deceased examined at Exh.20 in his examination-in-chief in the trial Court is that ""everything was fine in her matrimonial home"". He has stated that the in-laws of the deceased used to demand money from his daughter and also used to assault her however, in the same breath, he has asserted that the in-laws were not harassing the deceased. The evidence of this witness appears to be in contradistinction since in his cross-examination also, it is elicited from him that relationship between the accused No.1 and NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/2277/2006 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2025 undefined the deceased was very cordial. He has further stated that the accused No.1-husband was earning very well as he was working since 6 months in the factory and was drawing handsome salary. It is also deposed by him that after consultation with the other family members and elders and on their direction, it was decided to register the F.I.R. against the in-laws of the deceased. He has also admitted that the accused No.1 used to come along with his daughter for inquiring about his health. After meeting her mother, she used to return with the accused No.1 at her matrimonial home. He has admitted that along with his family members, he went to the Police Station to register the F.I.R.

9. PW-9-mother of the deceased, who is examined at Exh.21, has referred about demand of Rs.10,000/- by the in-laws and in her examination-in-chief, she has deposed that the accused did not do anything else. It is elicited in her cross-examination that the relationship between her daughter and the in-laws were very cordial and all of them used to visit their home.

10. A combined reading of all the evidence of 3 vital witnesses of the prosecution reveals that they have placed reliance on demand of Rs.10,000/- by the accused, but the same is not proved by any convincing evidence except a bald statement. The father of the deceased has not NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/2277/2006 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2025 undefined referred to the amount of Rs.10,000/-. The evidence also reveals that the accused No.1 was earning handsomely. It is also revealed that the accused No.1 as well as the deceased, used to visit her parental home for inquiring about health of her father and used to return at her matrimonial home, and their relationship was also cordial.

11. The F.I.R. is also registered, after due deliberation and amount of Rs.10,000/- appears to be fixed after discussion of the family members. For the span of 2 years of marriage, there is nothing on record to show that any demand of dowry was made from the deceased by the accused. It is further curious to note that though the father had gone along with the complainant and other family members, he did not register the F.I.R. but the same was registered by the uncle of the deceased i.e. PW-7 (brother of PW-8).

12. Thus, it appears that the story of demand of dowry and physical harassment and torture has been concocted and ultimately, the F.I.R. has been registered.

13. The scene of offence panchnama at Exh.10 as well as the evidence of the complainant reveal that there was no fencing around the well and it was parallel to the field, and was surrounded with grass. Since scythe as well as cut grass NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/2277/2006 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/01/2025 undefined and slippers were present near the well, in all probabilities, it was an accidental death. No investigation in this regard has been done. Thus, on an overall appreciation of the facts and evidence, which has been established on record, it appears that the F.I.R. has been registered, after due deliberation and attempt has been made to rope the accused in the offence by levelling false accusation of demand of dowry of Rs.10,000/-.

14. Hence, we do not find any convincing reason to interfere with the judgement and order of acquittal of the trial Court acquitting the accused from the offence, for which they were charged.

15. Appeal being sans merit, is hereby dismissed.

Registry to send back the Record and proceedings to the concerned Court.

Criminal Appeal No.564 of 2010
1.K.Suresh
2.K.Kannan

/versus/

The State of Tamil Nadu,
represented by the 
Assistant Commissioner of Police,
Law and Order,
Southern Range, Salem City.
(Crl.No.53 of 2009)			.. Respondent 

	Criminal Appeal filed under Section 374(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure praying to set aside the conviction and sentence passed in the judgment dated 06.09.2010 made in S.C.No.17 of 2010 on the file of the Court of the Sessions Judge, Mahila Court, Salem i/c (I Additional Sessions Judge, Salem) and allow this Criminal Appeal and acquit the appellant/accused 1 and 2 and 3. 	
		For Appellant	:Mr.S.Karthikeyan
		For Respondent 	:Mr.R.Surya Prakash
				Government Advocate
------
J U D G M E N T
The convicted accused 1 to 3 are the appellants herein. They are convicted for the offence under Section 498A IPC and sentenced to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for a period of two years and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- each, in default, to undergo 3 months Rigorous Imprisonment and the accused 1 to 3 were found not guilty for the offence under Section 306 IPC and under Section 4B of Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act.

2. After investigation, the respondent had filed Final Report before the trial Court. After observing the formalities, the case was numbered as S.C.No.17 of 2010. After framing charges, the trial has been conducted and the appellants were convicted for the offence as stated supra.

3. The case of the prosecution is that one Nithya was married to the 1st accused/appellant Suresh on 27.08.2007 and that, after their marriage, the said Nithya was ill-treated by the husband Suresh (A1), Kannan/Brother-in-law (A2), Anusuya/Mother-in-law (A3) and Manoranjitham/ Sister-in-law(A4). Further, she was also subject to severe scolding by the accused 2 to 4 for not getting conceived even after 6 months of marriage and that the 1st accused had kicked her for sitting in chair in front of her mother-in-law and that, the 4th accused used to scold her when she used to visit and hence, by the above acts of the appellants have given physical and mental torture to the deceased Nithya and hence, they have committed an offence under Section 498-A of IPC. Further, it is the case of the prosecution that on 09.01.2009, when the deceased Nithya sought permission to go to her parents house, the same was refused by the accused on flimsy ground and that the accused tortured her and hence, a charge under Section 4-B of the Tamil Nadu Prevention of Harassment of Women Act and further because of the above mentioned incidents all the accused had abetted the said Nithya to commit suicide and hence, they have committed an offence under Section 306 IPC.

4.To prove the charges, the prosecution has examined 13 witnesses as PW-1 to PW-13 and 19 documents were marked as Exs.P1 to P19. On the side of the defence, no witnesses were examined.

5.After hearing the prosecution case, the Sessions Judge, has acquitted the accused in respect of charge under Section 306 IPC and under Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Prevention of Harassment of Women Act, however, found guilty of offence under Section 498A of IPC and they were sentenced as stated supra. Aggrieved against the above said conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court, the convicted accused have preferred the present appeal.

6.The learned counsel appearing for the appellants contended that (a)the trial Court had committed a grave error in taking into consideration that the 3rd accused had refused to send the deceased along with PW-2 on 09.01.2009 as a ground of cruelty, while it is clear from the evidence of PW-2 that the 3rd accused refused to send the deceased to her home but she had only stated that day being a Friday, she would not send her to her mother's home and that PW-2 can come and take her on the next day and contended that, that aspect cannot be termed as cruelty. (b) Further, the statement of the 2nd accused that you know about me very well and this does not look nice, has been termed as cruelty by the trial Court is erroneous. When PW-2 had stated that this was uttered by the 2nd accused when the deceased wanted to go to parents home and that too being a Friday she was denied permission and the same is only for sentimental reasons, and cannot be terms as mental cruelty. The trial Court has erred in considering these circumstances as cruelty. (c) Even though the trial Court has given a categorical finding that the oral testimonies of the witnesses are insufficient to hold that the appellants/accused abetted deceased to commit suicide, it ought to have concluded that their testimonies are not reliable to convict the appellants/accused even under Section 498A IPC also.

7.Per contra, the learned Government Advocate (Crl.Side) has made his submissions supporting the impugned judgment passed by the Court below, stating that in view of the explanation given by PW-2 in the cross-examination regarding her presence till noon of the day in which the deceased Nithya committed suicide, and also in view of the various acts of the accused 1 to 3 upon the deceased, the trial Court has rightly come to the conclusion that all the appellants herein had committed the offence under Section 498A IPC.

8.Heard the learned counsel appearing for the appellants as well as the learned Government Advocate (crl.side) appearing for the State and perused the materials available on record.

9.Point for consideration:

(1)Whether the order of conviction passed by the Sessions Court under Section 498 A IPC is sustainable under law?
(2)Whether the sentence is excessive?
10.The Prosecution has come forward with a definite case that Nithya (now deceased), who was aged about 19 years, died by committing suicide on 09.01.2009 in the matrimonial home by hanging within a period of 17 months from her marriage and that Nithya committed suicide by hanging due to cruelty and harassment meted out at the hands of the accused 1 to 4, who are husband and his relatives. Accordingly, the respondent police laid final report for the alleged offence under Section 498A and 306 IPC and Section 4 B of Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act.

11. Based upon the evidence that was adduced during the time of trial, the learned Sessions Judge has found that the charges against the 4th accused [Manoranjitham sister of the first accused] are not made out. Accordingly, she was acquitted from all the charges and the trial Court further held that the alleged incident of cruelty said to have been caused by the acts of all the accused A1 to A3 on the victim girl are also inside the matrimonial house and accordingly, held that Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act is not attracted.

12.Further, the Sessions Judge has found that the evidence adduced by the prosecution in support of the charge under Section 306 IPC is insufficient to hold the accused as having abetted Nithya to commit suicide. The conduct that was elucidated from the evidence of the prosecution witness falls short of the term abetment. Accordingly, the learned Sessions Judge has held that as against the accused 1 to 4, the charge under Section 306 IPC has not been made out and acquitted them. Further, the trial Court held that the offence under Section 498A IPC is proved in the manner known to law and accordingly, the trial Court laid conviction for the offence under Section 498A of IPC and award sentence as supra.

13.PW-1 (Bhuvaneswari), who is the mother of the deceased Nithya, had set the criminal law into motion by filing Ex.P1-complaint which resulted in registering of Ex.P11(First Information Report). After investigation, final report has been filed. In view of the order of the learned Sessions Judge, wherein the appellants have been acquitted under Section 306 IPC and 4B of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment Act, this appeal is narrow down only to charge under section 498A IPC.

14.From the evidence of PW-1 to PW-3, who are relatives of the deceased, the following specific events are pointed out as harassment and cruelty in their cross examination as under:-

(1)15 sovereigns of jewels were given to Nithya during marriage along with cot and almirah. The accused alleged that the jewels were of less purity and the cot and almirah were of interior quality and forced the deceased family to change it and give higher purity of jewel and materials.
(2)The deceased was subjected to medical examination frequently which made her weak.
(3)A1 kicked the deceased since she was sitting on the chair when her mother-in-law (A3) was squatting on the floor.
(4)The accused forced the deceased to eat things which she did not like to take.
(5)A2 and A4 used to boss over the deceased. Their writ used to run large in the family.
(6)The deceased was not well days prior to her death. She was given treatment. She was feeling drowsy due to medication. The accused did not allow her to sleep. She was scolded by her mother-in-law(A3).
(7)On 09.01.2009 when the deceased wanted to go along with her maternal aunt (PW-2) the accused refused permission to leave the house.
On appreciation of the evidence and also taking note of the cross- examination of the said witnesses with that of the investigation officer, the learned Sessions Judge has rendered categorical finding that the above incidents 1 and 3 are all uncorroborated and run contrary to the evidence between the private prosecution witnesses. Accordingly, he has rejected all the said two incidents as spoken to by the private prosecution witnesses.

15.With regard to the charge under Section 498A IPC, the material witnesses are PW-1 and PW-2. PW-1 is the mother of the deceased and PW-2 is the sister of PW-1. It remains to be stated that the said PW-1 was present at the house of the accused along with the deceased Nithya upto 12.30 p.m on the fateful day i.e. 09.01.2009. The presence of PW-2, on the day, was not challenged during the cross- examination assumes significance besides lend credence to her version.

16. In her evidence, PW-2 has categorically stated that the accused attributed overt acts which fall with the definition of cruelty. According to PW-2, whenever the fourth accused, who is sister of the first accused was taking treatment for child birth, the same treatment was given to the deceased Nithya and the last two days prior to the fateful date on 09.01.2009 also assumes significance.

17.It is the specific evidence of PW-2 that the deceased was given some treatment on the previous day. So, she was feeling drowsy. However, without understanding her position, they have subjected her to harassment and scolded for not doing the household work which resulted the deceased to call her mother at Tiruppur and conveyed about the ill-treatment and about the incident. The said fact has been clearly spoken to by PW-1, which stands duly corroborated by the version of PW-2 who had been cross-examined on this point. It is to be stated that, PW-2 (sister of PW-1) was residing at Salem, where the deceased was also residing at a short distance. From the prosecution evidence, it is seen that on hearing the inconsolable voice of the deceased, her mother PW-1 contacted PW-2 , who is at Salem and asked her to go to the deceased house and take to her home. It is the specific evidence of PW-2 that as instructed by PW-1, she went to the house of the accused and asked permission of the accused to take the deceased to her house in the very same town viz., Salem. However, the accused have refused to send the victim along with PW-2, though it is only short distance from the matrimonial home in the same town, which assumes significance in the background of the case.

18.Furthermore, it is the specific evidence of PW-2 that A1 husband has refused permission to his wife(deceased) to go along PW-2, but he was ready to send her to the parents house at the same time. A1 husband was not inclined to send the deceased along with PW-2 since 09.01.2009 happens to be Friday. In fact, PW-2 admitted that A1 was ready to send the deceased along with PW-2 on the next day, but she had offered an explanation in the cross-examination that her house is very near to the deceased house and the atmosphere in the matrimonial home was fully charged with the power-show of the accused A1 to A3 and it is her further evidence that A2 was so adamant and was not understanding the feeling of the deceased girl who wanted to go to her parents house as she was not keeping well and feeling drowsy after medication as spoken to by PW-2 is found natural and clear to the events that was taking place few hours before suicide and hence, the same cannot be brush aside lightly. Though the defence was successful in elucidating an answer in the cross-examination from PW-2 that she has not whispered the last portion of the above said explanation during the investigation. However, she has given her further explanation that, since the police have not asked regarding the same, in detail during their investigation, she has not whispered anything regarding the alleged incident.

19.However, on a combined reading of the both chief and cross-examination of PW-2, this Court is of the considered view that the evidence of PW-2 is natural and does not suffer from any infirmity as alleged by the appellants' counsel. On the contrary, on a combined reading of the chief and cross-examination of PW-2 her version is found to be natural and probable and it does not suffer from any material contradiction on material facts relating the charge.

20.With regard to the incident of 5, 6, 7 in the above listed harassments, it appears from prosecution witness that all are not well in the matrimonial home. On a combined reading of the evidence of PW-2 and PW-1, this Court is of the considered view that the significance of acts committed by the appellants as spoken to by PW-2 amounts to cruelty falling within the explanation under Section 498A IPC.

21.This Court is also conscious of the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in AIR 2002 SC 2078 Giirdhar Shankar Tawade vs. State of Maharastra, wherein it was held that for convicting under Section 498A IPC, some cogent evidence is required to bring home the charge under Section 498A IPC, without which the charge cannot be said to be maintained. The relevant portion in the said judgment reads as follows ""A faint attempt has been made during the course of submissions that explanation (a) to the Section stands attracted and as such no fault can be attributed to the judgment. This, in our view, is a wholly fallacious approach to the matter by reason of the specific finding of the trial Court and the High Court concurred therewith that the death unfortunately was an accidental death and not suicide. If suicide is left out, then in that event question of applicability of explanation (a) would not arise - neither the second limb to cause injury and danger to life or limb or health would be attracted. In any event the willful act or conduct ought to be the proximate cause in order to bring home the charge under Section 498- A and not de-hors the same. To have an event sometime back cannot be termed to be a factum taken note of in the matter of a charge under Section 498-A. The legislative intent is clear enough to indicate in particular reference to explanation (b) that there shall have to be a series of acts in order to be a harassment within the meaning of explanation (b). The letters by itself though may depict a reprehensible conduct, would not, however, bring home the charge of Section 498-A against the accused. Acquittal of a charge under Section 306, as noticed hereinbefore, though not by itself a ground for acquittal under Section 498-A, but some cogent evidence is required to bring home the charge of Section 498-A as well, without which the charge cannot be said to be maintained ""

In the preceding paragraph, this Court for the reasons recorded therein has held that the acts committed by A1 to A3 on the deceased Nithya on days prior to the suicide pass test in positive and falls within the explanation to 498A IPC.
22.Taking note of the submission of the learned counsel for the appellants that on the solidatory evidence of PW-2, the trial Court erred in laying conviction under Section 498A IPC. However, this Court is of the opinion that it is not the quantity of the witnesses but it the quality of the witnesses that has to be determined in support of the charge under Section 498A especially when the said PW-2 was found to be present for the entire day till noon before the fateful date of occurrence.

23.In view of the above discussion, this Court holds that the evidence of PW-2, who attributed overt acts against A1 and A2, A3 which falls within the definition of cruelty and the similar finding rendered by the learned Sessions Judge, Mahila Court, Salem, do not call for any interference as there is no irregularity or illegality in appreciation of evidence of PW-2. Furthermore, the complaint of PW-4 for causing the harmful mental act of cruelty and refusal by the accused to send Nithya along with PW-2 cannot be looked into isolation. However, as discussed supra, the entirety of the circumstances leading to the said incident has to be taken as a whole and hence, this Court is of the considered view that the conviction laid by the learned Sessions Judge is well founded and well merited and the same does not call for any interference at the appellate stage. According, the said finding and conviction for offence under Section 498A of IPC.

24.However, taking into consideration of the incident and also the fact that the parties belong to rural area and even that proceeded to the incident of refusal to send Nithya along with PW-2, the manner in which the refusal was made, this Court is of the considered view that the sentence imposed on the appellants by the trial Court that the appellants was sentenced to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for a period of two years is modified to one of that the appellants are sentenced to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for a period of one year. The period of sentence already undergone by the appellants is ordered to be set off.

25. Accordingly, this Criminal Appeal is partly allowed with the following observations and directions:

i) the conviction for the offence under Section 498A of IPC is confirmed. However, the sentence is reduced for A1 and A2 to one year Rigorous Imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- each, in default, to undergo 3 months Rigorous Imprisonment. The period of sentence already undergone by the appellants 1 & 2 shall be set off.
ii) While taking into consideration that A.3 has already served sentence of 79 days before the commencement of trial and also taking into consideration the overt act which is proved against her and also taking note of the advance age of A.3, who is said to be 70 years, the sentence of two years awarded by the trial Court is modified as that of the period already undergone and the same is hereby set off only in respect of A.3.

Pulak Kumar Mallick vs The State Of West Bengal ,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/105750630/,"Calcutta High Court (Appellete Side)
Pulak Kumar Mallick vs The State Of West Bengal & Anr on 7 January, 2025
1. The present revisional application has been preferred praying for quashing of the proceeding being S.T. No. 13(12)17 (S.C. No. 4(4)16 corresponding to G.R. No. 2421 of 2014 pending before the learned Additional District and Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court, Ranaghat, Nadia, arising out of Hanskhali P.S. Case No. 652 of 2014 dated 28.10.2014 under Sections 306/34 of the Indian Penal Code.

2. The petitioner's case is that initially the present case was initiated under Sections 302/201/34 of the Indian Penal Code.

3. On completion of investigation the police submitted charge-sheet under Section 306/34 of the Indian Penal Code. The learned Magistrate taking cognizance framed charge under Section 306/34 IPC against the accused persons.

4. The allegations against the petitioner herein is that:-

""On 28.10.2014 one Samir Biswas S/o Lt. Niranjan Biswas of vill-Harnahi, P.O. Morao, P.S. Bansgau, Dist.-Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh submitted a written complaint to the effect that his daughter Mita Biswas (aged 22 years) came to the house of his brother in law Harish Chowdhury S/o Lt. Falaram Chowdhury of Benali Natungram, P.S. Hanskhali about one month ago. There Mita went to the house of one Panchanan Mallick (Maternal father in-law of Samir Biswas) at Bagula Purbapara, and on 26.10.2014 at 10.30 hrs. He was informed by Panchanan Mallick that Mita Biswas expired. Then Harish went to the house of Panchanan and then Bagula PHC where he found the dead body of Mita. He strongly believes that (1) Panchanan Mallick (2) Shyamali Mallick W/o Panchanan and (3) Pulak Mallick S/o Panchanan in nexus with one Prasanjit Das (who is known to Panchanan) murdered his daughter and to disappear the evidence, arranged for post-mortem over the dead body.""
5. It appears that the victim in this case on the date of incident had gone to the petitioner's father's house. The victim herein was aged about 22 years at the time of her death.

6. It appears from the materials on record including the case dairy that the victim died in the house of the petitioner.

7. It is further submitted by the learned counsel for the State that trial has commenced and three witnesses have already been examined by the trial Court.

8. The Supreme Court in CBI Vs. Aryan Singh, Criminal Appeal Nos.

1025-1026 of 2023, (Arising out of SLP (Crl.) Nos. 12794-12795 of 2022), it was held:-

""4. Having gone through the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court quashing the criminal proceedings and discharging the accused, we are of the opinion that the High Court has exceeded in its jurisdiction in quashing the entire criminal proceedings in exercise of the limited powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and/or in exercise of the powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
4.1 From the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court, it appears that the High Court has dealt with the proceedings before it, as if, the High Court was conducting a mini trial and/or the High Court was considering the applications against the judgment and order passed by the learned Trial Court on conclusion of trial. As per the cardinal principle of law, at the stage of discharge and/or quashing of the criminal proceedings, while exercising the powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C., the Court is not required to conduct the mini trial. The High Court in the common impugned judgment and order has observed that the charges against the accused are not proved. This is not the stage where the prosecution / investigating agency is/are required to prove the charges. The charges are required to be proved during the trial on the basis of the evidence led by the prosecution / investigating agency. Therefore, the High Court has materially erred in going in detail in the allegations and the material collected during the course of the investigation against the accused, at this stage. At the stage of discharge and/or while exercising the powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C., the Court has a very limited jurisdiction and is required to consider ""whether any sufficient material is available to proceed further against the accused for which the accused is required to be tried or not"".
4.2 One another reason pointed by the High Court is that the initiation of the criminal proceedings / proceedings is malicious. At this stage, it is required to be noted that the investigation was handed over to the CBI pursuant to the directions issued by the High Court. That thereafter, on conclusion of the investigation, the accused persons have been chargesheeted. Therefore, the High Court has erred in observing at this stage that the initiation of the criminal proceedings / proceedings is malicious. Whether the criminal proceedings was/were malicious or not, is not required to be considered at this stage. The same is required to be considered at the conclusion of the trial. In any case, at this stage, what is required to be considered is a prima facie case and the material collected during the course of the investigation, which warranted the accused to be tried.""

9. The Supreme Court in Gian Singh Vs. State of Punjab, AIR 2012 SC (Cri) 1796, it was held:-

""57. The position that emerges from the above discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under Section 320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre- dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words, the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding.""
10. The present case is for quashing of the proceedings under Section 306/34 of Indian Penal Code.

11. The Supreme Court in Daxaben Vs The State of Gujarat & Ors., Criminal Appeal No......of 2022, on July 29, 2022, held that:-

""14. The proposition of law enunciated and/or re-enunciated in the judgments cited above are well settled. Whether the acts alleged would constitute an offence, would depend upon the facts and circumstances of the case. Each case has to be judged on its own merits.
16. It is not necessary for this Court to go into the question of whether there was any direct or indirect act of incitement to the offence of abetment of suicide, since the High Court has not gone into that question. Suffice it to mention that even an indirect act of incitement to the commission of suicide would constitute the offence of abetment of suicide under Section 306 of the IPC.
20. In the aforesaid judgment, the High Court referred to an order dated 6 th December 2019 passed by a three Judge Bench of this Court in Crl. Appeal No.1852 of 2019 (New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Krishna Kumar Pandey) where this Court held that in a revision arising out of conviction, the High Court could not have sealed the right of the employer to take disciplinary action against the accused for misconduct in accordance with the Service Rules.
21. In Krishna Kumar Pandey (supra) this Court referred with approval, to the judgment of this Court in State of Punjab v. Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar and Ors. where this Court held that the High Court was not denuded of inherent power to recall a judgment and/or order which was without jurisdiction, or in violation of principles of natural justice, or passed without giving an opportunity of hearing to a party affected by the order or where an order was obtained by abusing the process of Court which would really amount to its being without jurisdiction. Inherent powers can be exercised to recall such orders.
24. Be that as it may, since the initial order dated 20th October 2020 is also under challenge in these appeals, it is really not necessary for this Court to delve deeper into the question of whether a final order passed under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. quashing an FIR could have, at all, been recalled by the High Court, in the absence of any specific provision in the Cr.P.C. for recall and/or review of such order. The High Court has, in effect, held that in exceptional circumstances, such orders can be recalled, in exercise of the inherent power of the High Court, to prevent injustice.
25. The only question in this appeal is whether the Criminal Miscellaneous Applications filed by the accused under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. could have been allowed and an FIR under Section 306 of the IPC for abetment to commit suicide, entailing punishment of imprisonment of ten years, could have been quashed on the basis of a settlement between the complainant and the accused named in the FIR. The answer to the aforesaid question cannot, but be in the negative.
28. In Monica Kumar (Dr.) v. State of U.P., this Court held that inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C has to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with caution and only when such exercise is justified by the tests specifically laid down in the section itself.
29. In exceptional cases, to prevent abuse of the process of the Court, the High Court might in exercise of its inherent powers under Section 482 quash criminal proceedings. However, interference would only be justified when the complaint did not disclose any offence, or was patently frivolous, vexatious or oppressive, as held by this Court in Mrs. Dhanalakshmi v. R. Prasanna Kumar.
30. In Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Ram Kishan Rohtagi and Others., a three- Judge Bench of this Court held:-
""6. It may be noticed that Section 482 of the present Code is the ad verbatim copy of Section 561- A of the old Code. This provision confers a separate and independent power on the High Court alone to pass orders ex debito justitiae in cases where grave and substantial injustice has been done or where the process of the court has been seriously abused. It is not merely a revisional power meant to be exercised against the orders passed by subordinate courts. It was under this section that in the old Code, the High Courts used to quash the proceedings or expunge uncalled for remarks against witnesses or other persons or subordinate courts. Thus, the scope, ambit and range of Section 561-A (which is now Section 482) is quite different from the powers conferred by the present Code under the provisions of Section 397. It may be that in some cases there may be overlapping but such cases would be few and far between. It is well settled that the inherent powers under Section 482 of the present Code can be exercised only when no other remedy is available to the litigant and not where a specific remedy is provided by the statute. Further, the power being an extraordinary one, it has to be exercised sparingly. If these considerations are kept in mind, there will be no inconsistency between Sections 482 and 397(2) of the present Code.
7. The limits of the power under Section 482 were clearly definedby this Court in Raj Kapoor v. State [(1980) 1 SCC 43 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 72] where Krishna Iyer, J. observed as follows : [SCC para 10, p. 47 : SCC (Cri) p. 76] ""Even so, a general principle pervades this branch of law when a specific provision is made : easy resort to inherent power is not right except under compelling circumstances. Not that there is absence of jurisdiction but that inherent power should not invade areas set apart for specific power under the same Code.""
8. Another important consideration which is to be kept in mind is as to when the High Court acting under the provisions of Section 482 should exercise the inherent power insofar as quashing of criminal proceedings are concerned. This matter was gone into in greater detail in Smt. Nagawwa v. Veeranna Shivalingappa Konjalgi [(1976) 3 SCC 736 : 1976 SCC (Cri) 507 : 1976 Supp SCR 123 : 1976 Cri LJ 1533] where the scope of Sections 202 and 204 of the present Code was considered and while laying down the guidelines and the grounds on which proceedings could be quashed this Court observed as follows : [SCC para 5, p. 741 : SCC (Cri) pp. 511-12] ""Thus it may be safely held that in the following cases an order of the Magistrate issuing process against the accused can be quashed or set aside:

(1) where the allegations made in the complaint or thestatements of the witnesses recorded in support of the same taken at their face value make out absolutely no case against the accused or the complaint does not disclose the essential ingredients of an offence which is alleged against the accused;
(2) where the allegations made in the complaint are patentlyabsurd and inherently improbable so that no prudent person can ever reach a conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused;
(3) where the discretion exercised by the Magistrate inissuing process is capricious and arbitrary having been based either on no evidence or on materials which are wholly irrelevant or inadmissible; and (4) where the complaint suffers from fundamental legaldefects, such as, want of sanction, or absence of a complaint by legally competent authority and the like.
The cases mentioned by us are purely illustrative and provide sufficient guidelines to indicate contingencies where the High Court can quash proceedings.""

9. Same view was taken in a later decision of this Court in Sharda Prasad Sinha v. State of Bihar [(1977) 1 SCC 505 : 1977 SCC (Cri) 132 :

(1977) 2 SCR 357 : 1977 Cri LJ 1146] where Bhagwati, J. speaking for the Court observed as follows : [SCC para 2, p. 506 : SCC (Cri) p. 133] ""It is now settled law that where the allegations set out in the complaint or the charge-sheet do not constitute any offence, it is competent to the High Court exercising its inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the order passed by the Magistrate taking cognizance of the offence.
10. It is, therefore, manifestly clear that proceedings against an accused in the initial stages can be quashed only if on the face of the complaint or the papers accompanying the same, no offence is constituted. In other words, the test is that taking the allegations and the complaint as they are, without adding or subtracting anything, if no offence is made out then the High Court will be justified in quashing the proceedings in exercise of its powers under Section 482 of the present Code.""

31. As held by this Court in State of Andhra Pradesh v. Gourieshetty Mahesh, the High Court, while exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C, would not ordinarily embark upon an enquiry into whether the evidence is reliable or not or whether there is reasonable possibility that the accusation would not be sustained.

32. In Paramjeet Batra v. State of Uttrakhand, this Court held:--

""12. While exercising its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code the High Court has to be cautious. This power is to be used sparingly and only for the purpose of preventing abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure ends of justice. Whether a complaint discloses a criminal offence or not depends upon the nature of facts alleged therein. Whether essential ingredients of criminal offence are present or not has to be judged by the High Court. ...""
33. In Madhavrao Jiwajirao Scindia v. Sambhajirao Chandrojirao Angre, a three Judge Bench of this Court summarized the law with regard to quashing of criminal proceedings under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. This Court held:--

""7. The legal position is well settled that when a prosecution at the initial stage is asked to be quashed, the test to be applied by the court is as to whether the uncontroverted allegations as made prima facie establish the offence. It is also for the court to take into consideration any special features which appear in a particular case to consider whether it is expedient and in the interest of justice to permit a prosecution to continue. This is so on the basis that the court cannot be utilised for any oblique purpose and where in the opinion of the court chances of an ultimate conviction are bleak and, therefore, no useful purpose is likely to be served by allowing a criminal prosecution to continue, the court may while taking into consideration the special facts of a case also quash the proceeding even though it may be at a preliminary stage.""
34. In Inder Mohan Goswami v. State of Uttaranchal, this Court observed:--

""46. The court must ensure that criminal prosecution is not used as an instrument of harassment or for seeking private vendetta or with an ulterior motive to pressurise the accused. On analysis of the aforementioned cases, we are of the opinion that it is neither possible nor desirable to lay down an inflexible rule that would govern the exercise of inherent jurisdiction. Inherent jurisdiction of the High Courts under Section 482 CrPC though wide has to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with caution and only when it is justified by the tests specifically laid down in the statute itself and in the aforementioned cases. In view of the settled legal position, the impugned judgment cannot be sustained.""
35. It is a well settled proposition of law that criminal prosecution, if otherwise justified, is not vitiated on account of malafides or vendetta. As said by Krishna Iyer, J. in State of Punjab v. Gurdial Singh ""if the use of the power for the fulfilment of a legitimate object the actuation or catalysation by malice is not legicidal.""

36. In Kapil Agarwal & Ors. v. Sanjay Sharma & Others, this Court observed that Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. is designed to achieve the purpose of ensuring that criminal proceedings are not permitted to degenerate into weapons of harassment.

37. Offence under Section 306 of the IPC of abetment to commit suicide is a grave, non- compoundable offence. Of course, the inherent power of the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. is wide and can even be exercised to quash criminal proceedings relating to non- compoundable offences, to secure the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of Court. Where the victim and offender have compromised disputes essentially civil and personal in nature, the High Court can exercise its power under Section 482 of the CrPC to quash the criminal proceedings. In what cases power to quash an FIR or a criminal complaint or criminal proceedings upon compromise can be exercised, would depend on the facts and circumstances of the case.

38. However, before exercising its power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. to quash an FIR, criminal complaint and/or criminal proceedings, the High Court, as observed above, has to be circumspect and have due regard to the nature and gravity of the offence. Heinous or serious crimes, which are not private in nature and have a serious impact on society cannot be quashed on the basis of a compromise between the offender and the complainant and/or the victim. Crimes like murder, rape, burglary, dacoity and even abetment to commit suicide are neither private nor civil in nature. Such crimes are against the society. In no circumstances can prosecution be quashed on compromise, when the offence is serious and grave and falls within the ambit of crime against society.

39. Orders quashing FIRs and/or complaints relating to grave and serious offences only on basis of an agreement with the complainant, would set a dangerous precedent, where complaints would be lodged for oblique reasons, with a view to extract money from the accused. Furthermore, financially strong offenders would go scot free, even in cases of grave and serious offences such as murder, rape, brideburning, etc. by buying off informants/complainants and settling with them. This would render otiose provisions such as Sections 306, 498A, 304-B etc. incorporated in the IPC as a deterrent, with a specific social purpose.

40. In Criminal Jurisprudence, the position of the complainant isonly that of the informant. Once an FIR and/or criminal complaint is lodged and a criminal case is started by the State, it becomes a matter between the State and the accused. The State has a duty to ensure that law and order is maintained in society. It is for the state to prosecute offenders. In case of grave and serious noncompoundable offences which impact society, the informant and/or complainant only has the right of hearing, to the extent of ensuring that justice is done by conviction and punishment of the offender. An informant has no right in law to withdraw the complaint of a noncompoundable offence of a grave, serious and/or heinous nature, which impacts society.

41. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab, this Court discussed the circumstances in which the High Court quashes criminal proceedings in case of a non-compoundable offence, when there is a settlement between the parties and enunciated the following principles:-

""58. Where the High Court quashes a criminal proceeding having regard to the fact that the dispute between the offender and the victim has been settled although the offences are not compoundable, it does so as in its opinion, continuation of criminal proceedings will be an exercise in futility and justice in the case demands that the dispute between the parties is put to an end and peace is restored; securing the ends of justice being the ultimate guiding factor. No doubt, crimes are acts which have harmful effect on the public and consist in wrongdoing that seriously endangers and threatens the well- being of the society and it is not safe to leave the crime-doer only because he and the victim have settled the dispute amicably or that the victim has been paid compensation, yet certain crimes have been made compoundable in law, with or without the permission of the court. In respect of serious offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., or other offences of mental depravity under IPC or offences of moral turpitude under special statutes, like the Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants while working in that capacity, the settlement between the offender and the victim can have no legal sanction at all. However, certain offences which overwhelmingly and predominantly bear civil flavour having arisen out of civil, mercantile, commercial, financial, partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony, particularly relating to dowry, etc. or the family dispute, where the wrong is basically to the victim and the offender and the victim have settled all disputes between them amicably, irrespective of the fact that such offences have not been made compoundable, the High Court may within the framework of its inherent power, quash the criminal proceeding or criminal complaint or FIR if it is satisfied that on the face of such settlement, there is hardly any likelihood of the offender being convicted and by not quashing the criminal proceedings, justice shall be casualty and ends of justice shall be defeated. The above list is illustrative and not exhaustive. Each case will depend on its own facts and no hard-and-fast category can be prescribed"".
42. In Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab, this Court held that in case of heinous and serious offences, which are generally to be treated as crime against society, it is the duty of the State to punish the offender. Hence, even when there is a settlement, the view of the offender and victim will not prevail since it is in the interest of society that the offender should be punished to deter others from committing a similar crime.

43. In State of Maharashtra v. Vikram Anantrai Doshi, this Court held:-

""26. ... availing of money from a nationalised bank in the manner, as alleged by the investigating agency, vividly exposits fiscal impurity and, in a way, financial fraud. The modus operandi as narrated in the charge-sheet cannot be put in the compartment of an individual or personal wrong. It is a social wrong and it has immense societal impact. It is an accepted principle of handling of finance that whenever there is manipulation and cleverly conceived contrivance to avail of these kinds of benefits it cannot be regarded as a case having overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil character. The ultimate victim is the collective. It creates a hazard in the financial interest of the society. The gravity of the offence creates a dent in the economic spine of the nation. ...""
44. In CBI v. Maninder Singh, this Court held:-

""17. ... In economic offences the Court must not only keep in view that money has been paid to the bank which has been defrauded but also the society at large. It is not a case of simple assault or a theft of a trivial amount; but the offence with which we are concerned was well planned and was committed with a deliberate design with an eye on personal profit regardless of consequence to the society at large. To quash the proceeding merely on the ground that the accused has settled the amount with the bank would be a misplaced sympathy. If the prosecution against the economic offenders are not allowed to continue, the entire community is aggrieved.""
45. In State of Tamil Nadu v. R. Vasanthi Stanley, this Court held:-

""14. ... Lack of awareness, knowledge or intent is neither to be considered nor accepted in economic offences. The submission assiduously presented on gender leaves us unimpressed. An offence under the criminal law is an offence and it does not depend upon the gender of an accused. True it is, there are certain provisions in CrPC relating to exercise of jurisdiction under Section 437, etc. therein but that altogether pertains to a different sphere. A person committing a murder or getting involved in a financial scam or forgery of documents, cannot claim discharge or acquittal on the ground of her gender as that is neither constitutionally nor statutorily a valid argument. The offence is gender neutral in this case. We say no more on this score.
15. ... A grave criminal offence or serious economic offence or for that matter the offence that has the potentiality to create a dent in the financial health of the institutions, is not to be quashed on the ground that there is delay in trial or the principle that when the matter has been settled it should be quashed to avoid the load on the system. ...""
46. In Parbatbhai Aahir Alias Parbathbhai Bhimsinhbhai Karmur and Others v. State of Gujrat and Another, a threeJudge Bench of this Court quoted Narinder Singh (supra), Vikram Anantrai Doshi (supra), CBI v. Maninder Singh (supra), R. Vasanthi Stanley (supra) and held:-

""16. The broad principles which emerge from the precedents on the subject, may be summarised in the following propositions:
16.1. Section 482 preserves the inherent powers of the High Court to prevent an abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. The provision does not confer new powers. It only recognises and preserves powers which inhere in the High Court.
16.2. The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court to quash a first information report or a criminal proceeding on the ground that a settlement has been arrived at between the offender and the victim is not the same as the invocation of jurisdiction for the purpose of compounding an offence. While compounding an offence, the power of the court is governed by the provisions of Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The power to quash under Section 482 is attracted even if the offence is non-compoundable.
16.3. In forming an opinion whether a criminal proceeding or complaint should be quashed in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482, the High Court must evaluate whether the ends of justice would justify the exercise of the inherent power.
16.4. While the inherent power of the High Court has a wide ambit and plenitude it has to be exercised (i) to secure the ends of justice, or (ii) to prevent an abuse of the process of any court. 16.5. The decision as to whether a complaint or first information report should be quashed on the ground that the offender and victim have settled the dispute, revolves ultimately on the facts and circumstances of each case and no exhaustive elaboration of principles can be formulated. 16.6. In the exercise of the power under Section 482 and while dealing with a plea that the dispute has been settled, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the offence. Heinous and serious offences involving mental depravity or offences such as murder, rape and dacoity cannot appropriately be quashed though the victim or the family of the victim have settled the dispute. Such offences are, truly speaking, not private in nature but have a serious impact upon society. The decision to continue with the trial in such cases is founded on the overriding element of public interest in punishing persons for serious offences.
16.7. As distinguished from serious offences, there may be criminal cases which have an overwhelming or predominant element of a civil dispute. They stand on a distinct footing insofar as the exercise of the inherent power to quash is concerned.
16.8. Criminal cases involving offences which arise from commercial, financial, mercantile, partnership or similar transactions with an essentially civil flavour may in appropriate situations fall for quashing where parties have settled the dispute.
16.9. In such a case, the High Court may quash the criminal proceeding if in view of the compromise between the disputants, the possibility of a conviction is remote and the continuation of a criminal proceeding would cause oppression and prejudice; and 16.10. There is yet an exception to the principle set out in propositions 16.8. and 16.9. above.
Economic offences involving the financial and economic well-being of the State have implications which lie beyond the domain of a mere dispute between private disputants. The High Court would be justified in declining to quash where the offender is involved in an activity akin to a financial or economic fraud or misdemeanour. The consequences of the act complained of upon the financial or economic system will weigh in the balance.""

47. In State of Madhya Pradesh v. Laxmi Narayan & Ors., a three-Judge Bench discussed the earlier judgments of this Court and laid down the following principles:-

""15. Considering the law on the point and the other decisions of this Court on the point, referred to hereinabove, it is observed and held as under:
15.1. That the power conferred under Section 482 of the Code to quash the criminal proceedings for the non-compoundable offences under Section 320 of the Code can be exercised having overwhelmingly and predominantly the civil character, particularly those arising out of commercial transactions or arising out of matrimonial relationship or family disputes and when the parties have resolved the entire dispute amongst themselves;
15.2. Such power is not to be exercised in those prosecutions which involved heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not private in nature and have a serious impact on society;
15.3. Similarly, such power is not to be exercised for the offences under the special statutes like the Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants while working in that capacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis of compromise between the victim and the offender;
15.4. Offences under Section 307 IPC and the Arms Act, etc. would fall in the category of heinous and serious offences and therefore are to be treated as crime against the society and not against the individual alone, and therefore, the criminal proceedings for the offence under Section 307 IPC and/or the Arms Act, etc. which have a serious impact on the society cannot be quashed in exercise of powers under Section 482 of the Code, on the ground that the parties have resolved their entire dispute amongst themselves. However, the High Court would not rest its decision merely because there is a mention of Section 307 IPC in the FIR or the charge is framed under this provision. It would be open to the High Court to examine as to whether incorporation of Section 307 IPC is there for the sake of it or the prosecution has collected sufficient evidence, which if proved, would lead to framing the charge under Section 307 IPC. For this purpose, it would be open to the High Court to go by the nature of injury sustained, whether such injury is inflicted on the vital/delicate parts of the body, nature of weapons used, etc. However, such an exercise by the High Court would be permissible only after the evidence is collected after investigation and the charge-sheet is filed/charge is framed and/or during the trial.
Such exercise is not permissible when the matter is still under investigation. Therefore, the ultimate conclusion in paras 29.6 and 29.7 of the decision of this Court in Narinder Singh [(2014) 6 SCC 466: (2014) 3 SCC (Cri) 54] should be read harmoniously and to be read as a whole and in the circumstances stated hereinabove; 15.5. While exercising the power under Section 482 of the Code to quash the criminal proceedings in respect of noncompoundable offences, which are private in nature and do not have a serious impact on society, on the ground that there is a settlement/compromise between the victim and the offender, the High Court is required to consider the antecedents of the accused; the conduct of the accused, namely, whether the accused was absconding and why he was absconding, how he had managed with the complainant to enter into a compromise, etc.""

48. In Arun Singh and Others v. State of Uttar Pradesh Through its Secretary and Another, this Court held:-

""14. In another decision in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab (2014) 6 SCC 466 : (2014) 3 SCC (Cri) 54] it has been observed that in respect of offence against the society it is the duty to punish the offender. Hence, even where there is a settlement between the offender and victim the same shall not prevail since it is in interests of the society that offender should be punished which acts as deterrent for others from committing similar crime. On the other hand, there may be offences falling in the category where the correctional objective of criminal law would have to be given more weightage than the theory of deterrent punishment. In such cases, the court may be of the opinion that a settlement between the parties would lead to better relations between them and would resolve a festering private dispute and thus may exercise power under Section 482 CrPC for quashing the proceedings or the complaint or the FIR as the case may be.
15. Bearing in mind the above principles which have been laiddown, we are of the view that offences for which the appellants have been charged are in fact offences against society and not private in nature. Such offences have serious impact upon society and continuance of trial of such cases is founded on the overriding effect of public interests in punishing persons for such serious offences. It is neither an offence arising out of commercial, financial, mercantile, partnership or such similar transactions or has any element of civil dispute thus it stands on a distinct footing. In such cases, settlement even if arrived at between the complainant and the accused, the same cannot constitute a valid ground to quash the FIR or the charge-sheet.
16. Thus the High Court cannot be said to be unjustified inrefusing to quash the charge-sheet on the ground of compromise between the parties.""
49. In exercise of power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., the Court does not examine the correctness of the allegation in the complaint except in exceptionally rare cases where it is patently clear that the allegations are frivolous or do not disclose any offence.

50. In our considered opinion, the Criminal Proceeding cannot be nipped in the bud by exercise of jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr. P.C. only because there is a settlement, in this case a monetary settlement, between the accused and the complainant and other relatives of the deceased to the exclusion of the hapless widow of the deceased. As held by the three- Judge Bench of this Court in Laxmi Narayan & Ors. (supra), Section 307 of the IPC falls in the category of heinous and serious offences and are to be treated as crime against society and not against the individual alone. On a parity of reasoning, offence under section 306 of the IPC would fall in the same category. An FIR under Section 306 of the IPC cannot even be quashed on the basis of any financial settlement with the informant, surviving spouse, parents, children, guardians, care-givers or anyone else. It is clarified that it was not necessary for this Court to examine the question whether the FIR in this case discloses any offence under Section 306 of the IPC, since the High Court, in exercise of its power under Section 482 CrPC, quashed the proceedings on the sole ground that the disputes between the accused and the informant had been compromised.""

In the said case (Daxaben Vs The State of Gujarat & Ors.

(Supra)) the Court set aside the order of the High Court quashing proceedings under Section 306 IPC in view of settlement between the parties.

12. In the present case, the petitioners are named in the suicide note and the signature on the note has been proved to be that of the deceased.

13. The case has to thus proceed towards trial there being prima facie material in this case against the petitioners to be decided in accordance with law, in the interest of Justice. Interference at this stage shall amount to abuse of the process of law.

14. Quashing a case of such a nature will cause miscarriage of justice.

(Daxaben Vs The State of Gujarat & Ors. (Supra)).

15. CRR 3904 of 2023 is thus dismissed.

16. Trial court to proceed in the case expeditiously.

17. There will be no order as to costs.

18. All connected applications, if any, stand disposed of.

19. Interim order, if any, stands vacated.

20. Copy of this judgment be sent to the learned Trial Court for necessary compliance.

-Vs-

State by Inspector of Police, Needamangalam Police Station, Tiruvarur District.

(Cr.No.285 of 2011) ... Respondent Criminal Appeal filed under Section 374(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, praying to set aside the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge, Magalir Neethimandram (Fast Track Mahalir Court), Tiruvarur, Tiruvarur District in S.C.No.54 of 2012 dated 29.10.2014 and acquit the accused/appellants herein from all the charges.

For Appellants : Mr.Swami Subramanian For Respondent : Mr.Charles C.Premkumar Government Advocate (Crl.Side) ***** JUDGMEN T Assailing the conviction and sentence imposed in SC.No.54 of 2012 on the file of the Magalir Neethimandram [Fast Track Mahalir Court], https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Tiruvarur for the offence under Section 498A of IPC, the accused/appellants have filed this appeal.

2. The respondent police filed a final report against the appellants alleging that the marriage between the first appellant and the deceased Geetha was a kind of love cum arranged marriage, which was solemnized on 06.04.2011. After marriage, the second appellant demanded 10 sovereigns gold jewels and motor cycle from the deceased. Unable to bear the repeated dowry demand and harassment, the deceased had gone to her parents house. On 01.08.2011, when the deceased came to the house of the accused to take her saree, she was told by the first appellant that if she did not bring 10 sovereigns of gold and motor cycle, the second appellant will scold and cursed her to die. Hurt by his words, the deceased had gone to her parents house, poured kerosene over her and set fire. As a consequence thereof, she suffered burn injuries and died on 10.08.2011. Therefore, the appellants were charged for the offence under Section 304B IPC.

3. During the trial, on the side of the prosecution PWs-1 to 20 were examined, Exs.P1 to P9 and M.O.1 were marked. No witness was examined on the side of the appellants and Ex.D1 was marked. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/

4. The case of the prosecution as seen from the evidence of prosecution witnesses, in brief, is as follows:

4.1. PWs-1 and 2 are the parents of the deceased Geetha, PW-3 is her brother. It is seen from the evidence that their residence and the residence of the appellants situate in the same street. The first appellant and the deceased were in love with each other. With the consent of both the families, their marriage was celebrated. After the marriage, the deceased informed them that the appellants demanded 10 sovereigns of gold jewels and motor cycle. Therefore she came to her parents' house. Then the first appellant asked the deceased to come and live with him, else he would consume poison and commit suicide. Then deceased had gone to her matrimonial home and lived there for some time. Again, the second appellant repeated the same demand. The first appellant also asked her to get 10 sovereigns of gold and motor cycle, else die. Therefore, the deceased self immolated her.
4.2. Immediately, thereafter PW-2 took her daughter to Mannargudi Government Hospital, where she was examined by PW-9 Doctor Govindaraj.
PW-2 informed the doctor that the lamp accidentally fell on the saree of Geetha and the saree caught fire, resulting in burn injuries to Geetha. On https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ examination, doctor found that Geetha suffered 80% burn injuries and she was conscious. He gave first aid treatment and sent her to Tanjore Medical College Hospital for further treatment. The accident register is Ex.P3.

4.3. PW-18 was working as Special Sub Inspector in Needamangalam Police Station on 01.08.2011. He received intimation from Tanjore Medical College Hospital through wireless about the admission of Geetha with burn injuries. He visited the hospital at 5.00.p.m and recorded her statement (Ex.P7) and registered it in general dairy as 155/2011.

4.4. PW-14-the Judicial Magistrate received the intimation from the Tanjore Medical College Hospital for recording the dying declaration of Geetha at 5.40.p.m on 01.08.2011. Immediately, he proceeded to the hospital. After making preliminary enquiries and finding that the deponent Geetha was in a fit and conscious state of mind to give statement, he recorded her dying declaration and the dying declaration is Ex.P6.

4.5. PW-19 was the Sub Inspector of Police at the relevant point of time. He registered Ex.P8-First Information Report in Crime No.285 of 2011 under Section 498A r/w 116 IPC on 05.08.2011. He visited the scene of occurrence and recorded the statement of witnesses, prepared Ex.P9-rough sketch.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis// 4.6. PW-20, the Deputy Superintendent of Police took charge of the investigation in this case on 11.08.2011, Geetha died on 10.08.2011 and therefore, the FIR was altered for the offence under Section 304B IPC and he sent the FIR to the Enquiry of Revenue Divisional Officer.

4.7. PW-13 was the Revenue Divisional Officer at Tanjore. On receiving the FIR at about 12.00 noon on 11.08.2011, he conducted the inquest in the presence of witnesses. The enquiry revealed that the deceased Geetha died of dowry harassment. His report is Ex.P5.

4.8. PW-10 was working as Assistant Surgeon in the Tanjore Medical College Hospital in Medico Legal department. As per the requisition of the Revenue Divisional Officer, he conducted the post mortem on the body of the deceased on 11.08.2011. On examination, he found that the deceased suffered 86% burn injuries and died of its consequences.

4.9. In continuation of the investigation, PW-20 recorded the statement of witnesses and after completing the investigation, he filed final report against the accused/appellants for the offence under Section 304B IPC.

4.10. After hearing the Public Prosecutor and accused, the learned Trial Judge found that the prosecution had failed to prove that the deceased https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ was subjected to harassment and cruelty demanding dowry by the appellants soon before her death and therefore, found that the charge under Section 304B IPC was not proved. However, the learned Trial Judge found that the evidence proved that the appellants committed cruelty against the deceased and they are liable to be convicted and punished under Section 498A IPC. Accordingly, the learned Trial Judge convicted the appellants for the offence under Section 498A IPC and sentenced them to undergo one and half year rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs.1,000/-, in default, three months rigorous imprisonment. Against the said judgment, the appellants have filed this appeal.

5. The learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the allegation of the demand of dowry and cruelty on account of non payment of dowry. There are lot of material lapses, omissions and contradictions in the case of the prosecution and in the evidence of prosecution witnesses. There are different versions about the manner in which and the place where the deceased said to have self immolated herself. Though a cognizable offence was made out from the allegations stated in the complaint given on 01.08.2011, FIR was registered only on 05.08.2011 and it reached the Court only on 08.08.2011. The https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Revenue Divisional Officer has not independently recorded the statement of witnesses and he submitted his report without filling the necessary details. The Magistrate recorded the dying declaration with his own handwriting, but foot note certificate was computer print out. It creates suspicion in the genuineness of the dying declaration. Even in the dying declaration, there is no allegation of cruelty against the appellant. It is profoundly clear from the evidence of prosecution witnesses that the charge against the accused that they demanded dowry and committed cruelty was not proved. On the other hand, there are bundle of material contradictions in the evidence of material witnesses and material lapses entitling the accused to benefit of doubt. Without considering the aforesaid aspects, the learned Trial Judge wrongly convicted the appellants under Section 498A IPC. Therefore, he prays for setting aside the conviction and sentence against the appellants under Section 498A IPC and acquittal of the appellants/accused.

6. In response, the learned Government Advocate (Crl.Side) submitted that of course there is a delay in registering the FIR. However, the delay will not create any doubt in the case of the prosecution. The FIR was registered on the basis of the complaint given by the deceased. It clearly proved that the accused had demanded dowry and committed cruelty against https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ the deceased. The learned Trial Judge rightly appreciated the evidence and convicted the appellants under Section 498A IPC. Therefore, he prays for confirming the judgment of the learned Trial Judge and dismissal of the appeal.


7. The point for consideration in this appeal is whether the conviction of the appellants under Section 489 of IPC and the sentence imposed thereon can be sustained?


8. There is no dispute with regard to the marriage between the first appellant and the deceased and that the residence of the appellants and the parental home of the deceased situate in the same street. It is the admitted case that the self immolation of the deceased happened on 01.08.2011. However, the FIR was registered only on 05.08.2011. It is seen from the Ex.P7-statement of the deceased, on the basis of which the FIR was registered that after the marriage, the second appellant tortured the deceased to get 10 sovereigns of gold and motor cycle and harassed her. Therefore, she came to her parents house. After some months, her husband came to her and told her that if she did not come back to his house, he would consume https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ poison and commit suicide. Therefore, she went to her matrimonial home. Again, her father-in-law/second appellant repeated the demand and scolded her that neither she knows cooking nor she brings gold jewels. Angered at this, she came to her parental house. On 01.08.2011, she went to her matrimonial home and asked her husband/the first appellant as to how long they have to continue like this. For that, the first appellant asked her to die. Infuriated over this, she came to her house, poured kerosene over her and set fire.

9. The reading of Ex.P7 complaint shows that the allegations of demand of dowry was specifically made only against the second appellant. The next important document in this case is the Ex.P6-dying declaration and the same was recorded by the learned Judicial Magistrate on 01.08.2011 at about 6.00.p.m. After satisfying about the fitness of the deponent to give declaration, the learned Judicial Magistrate asked the deceased about the injuries found on her. She stated that she poured kerosene on her and set fire at her home for the reason that there was a dispute with her husband on Friday. She told that her uncle i.e., second appellant harassed her. She has not specifically stated what sort of harassment meted out to her by her uncle. There is no specific allegation of any kind of harassment against the second https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ appellant in the dying declaration. The reading of evidence of PWs-1 to 3 shows that they said in unison that the appellants demanded 10 sovereigns of gold and motor cycle. However, as found in Ex.P7-complaint that there is no specific allegation against the first appellant with regard to the demand of dowry and in the dying declaration, there is no specific allegation of demand of dowry against the both the appellants.

10. It is pertinent to note here that PW-1 contradicts his evidence with regard to the place where the deceased set fire on her. At one place, PW-1 stated that the deceased set fire to herself when she was at the house of the accused and later, he said that he gave a statement before the police that his daughter set fire to herself when she was at his house. PW-2 informed the doctor that her daughter suffered burn injuries when the lamp accidentally fell on saree and caught fire. She admitted saying so during her cross examination, but continued to say that since she was advised to say like that. Otherwise her daughter would not be given treatment and therefore, she said like that. PW-2 stated that she informed the Revenue Divisional Officer that the accused tried to pour kerosene over her daughter and set fire and her daughter plucked the match box and thrown in water and came to her house. PW-3 stated that the deceased brought kerosene from the house of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ accused and set fire to herself. But the admitted case of the prosecution is that the deceased poured kerosene on her and set fire at the parental house. Therefore, it is clear that PWs-1 to 3 had given contradictory and false evidence with regard to the place where the deceased had poured kerosene on her and set fire. This false evidence, creates serious doubt and dented the case of the prosecution with regard to the charge of demand of dowry raised by the appellants.

11. PW-2 admitted that the first appellant told the deceased that if she did not come to live with him, he would consume poison and commit suicide. PW-3 also stated on similar lines. This evidence of PWs-2 and 3 shows that the first appellant was madly in love with the deceased and therefore, the allegation is that he also demanded 10 sovereigns of gold and motor cycle could not be true.

12.Something has to be said about the role of the official witnesses in this case. The learned Judicial Magistrate, who recorded the dying declaration in his handwriting, typed the certificate of dying declaration in a computer making it clear that the certificate was not given at the time of recording the statement and subsequently, annexed with the dying declaration. It is not the proper procedure. Certificate should also have been https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ written in hand. It shows the lack of sensitivity and lackadaisical attitude of the learned Judicial Magistrate in recording the dying declaration. The inquest report-Ex.P5 shows that the Revenue Divisional Officer has not filled the necessary details in the annexure in column nos.1 to 16, which shows the non application of mind. This is a cognizable offence. PW-18 has not registered the FIR, but only taken the case as a petition enquiry. Apparently, there is a delay in registering the FIR and sending the FIR to the Court. FIR was sent to Court only on 08.08.2011. The cross examination of PW-19 shows that he admitted that the evidence of PW-2 is a exaggerated one and there is no mention about the demand of jewelery and dowry by the first appellant in her statement.

13. The overall analysis of oral and documentary evidence in this case shows that the prosecution case, apart from unusual delay on the part of police to register the case, suffers from material contradictions in the evidences, which are not properly explained. When the Trial Court found that there was no evidence to prove that soon before the date of death, the deceased was subjected to harassment or cruelty and therefore, the accused/appellants cannot be convicted under Section 304B IPC, they can not also be convicted under Section 498A IPC for the same reason. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/

14. In this view of the matter, this Court finds that the conviction of the appellants under Section 498A IPC and sentence imposed on them are not legally correct and therefore, the conviction recorded under Section 498A IPC and the sentence imposed against the appellants are liable to be set aside.

15. In the result, this Criminal Appeal is allowed. The conviction and sentence imposed against the appellants under Section 498A IPC are hereby set aside and the appellants/accused are acquitted from the charge. Fine amount, if any, paid shall be refunded. Bail bonds, if any, already executed shall stand cancelled.

1. The present Writ Petition has been filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, by both the original Accused persons against whom offence vide Crime No. 50 of 2019 has been registered at Chiplun Police Station, Taluka Chiplun, District Ratnagiri, at the KVM WP 2841 OF 2019.odt behest of Respondent No.2 for the offence punishable under Sections 306, 498A, 109, 201 of Indian Penal Code.


2. This Court by its order dated 7th October, 2019 (Coram :

Ranjit More & N.J.Jamadar, JJ.) issued notice to Respondent No.2.
Further by an order dated 17th February, 2020 (Coram : B. P. Dharmadhikari & N. R. Borkar, JJ.) this Court took on record the charge-sheet filed in the proceedings and in the meanwhile stayed further proceedings in furtherance of C.R.No. 50 of 2019. After Respondent No.2 appeared in the present proceedings through an advocate, on 2nd January 2025, we have heard advocate Mr.Mehul Shah for the Petitioner, advocate Ms.Anuja Gotad, A.P.P. for the State, advocate Ms.Anamika Vichare for Respondent No.2.
3. It has been vehemently submitted on behalf of the Petitioner that the marriage between Petitioner No.1 and the deceased had taken place in the year 2002 which was not a arranged marriage, but a love marriage and after a period of 17 years, the unfortunate incident had occurred. The deceased was a local Sarpanch and was KVM WP 2841 OF 2019.odt also a mother of son Shreedaya who was studying in 10th standard at the relevant time. The deceased had even earlier attempted to commit suicide. The Informant who is the sister of the deceased is attached to a rival political party, to that of the deceased, who was a Sarpanch of the local village. The father of the deceased in his statement to the police, has categorically mentioned that he has no grievance against the Petitioners. It is further submitted that the husband of Petitioner No.2 and the Petitioner No.1 were partners in business, therefore the wife of the Petitioner No.1 who is now deceased and Petitioner No.2 used to interact with each other. It is further submitted that in fact, the deceased had made her last telephonic call to the Informant. The fact that the father of the deceased had no complaint against Petitioners, and only the Informant who is the sister of the deceased, belonging to a different political ideology and had filed a complaint after three days proves that the said complaint was an afterthought complaint filed with the ulterior motives to take revenge. The Sessions Court had granted bail to Petitioner No.2 immediately on 13 th March, 2019 and the High Court had granted bail to Petitioner No.1 on 20th March, 2019. A bare reading of FIR, shows that the ingredients of offence punishable under KVM WP 2841 OF 2019.odt Sections 306, 498A, 109, 201 read with 34 of the Indian Penal Code are not made out.


4. Learned advocate appearing for the Petitioner has relied on the decision of this Court in Meenabai Deepak Mahale & Ors. vs. the State of Maharashtra, reported in 2024 SCC OnLine Bom 952. He submitted that the Writ Petition be allowed and the F.I.R. be quashed and set aside.


5. Per contra, the learned A.P.P. as well as learned advocate appearing for Respondent No.2 strongly opposed the Petition and submitted that the perusal of the entire FIR and charge-sheet would show that there is ample evidence against both Petitioners to convict them under the offence under Sections 306, 498A, 109, 201 read with 34 of the Indian Penal Code. It is further submitted that once Charge- Sheet is filed this court should not entertain the present writ petition. The Statement recorded of witnesses and the fact that it has come on record that the Accused no.1/ petitioner no.1, has deleted data from the mobile phone, further proves that the Accused persons needs to face KVM WP 2841 OF 2019.odt trial and the F.I.R. can't be quashed at this stage.

6. For quashing criminal proceedings under Section 482 of Criminal Procedure Code, and under Article 226 of the Constitution, we have to see whether the allegations in the complaint and F.I.R. prima facie indicate that there are serious allegations against the accused of having committed an offence.


7. The present Writ Petition has been jointly preferred by both the Accused. The Accused No.1/Petitioner No.1 is the husband of the deceased lady, who has committed suicide. It is the case of the prosecution that the deceased was under tremendous pressure as she got knowledge that Petitioner No.1, who is her husband and Petitioner No.2 who is the wife of the partner of her husband, had illicit relationship. The F.I.R. has been lodged by the police after a complaint being lodged by the Informant who is the sister of the deceased. The Informant has come up with the case that due to the illicit relationship of Petitioner No.1, with the Petitioner No.2, the deceased was under

tremendous pressure. Hence, she committed the suicide on 5th KVM WP 2841 OF 2019.odt February, 2019 by consuming poison, due to which the deceased died on 6th February, 2019. In the complaint attached to the F.I.R. it has been specifically stated as under : "" ..... माझ्या नवयाचे बाहे र काय प्रताप आहे त त्याने त्याची पार्टनर स्मि मता झा हीचे शी त्याची जवळीक वाढली असून माझ्याकडे साधे बोलायला सु द्धा वे ळ नाही. त्याने व स्मि मता झा यांनी एकत्र फोर्टो दे खील काढले आहे त. तु ला मी स्मिवचारत नाही असे वे ळोवे ळी बोलून माझ्याशी वाद घालून त्रास दे त असतो परं तु त्याबाबत मी तु झ्याकडे व माहे री काम सां गन ू मी माझ्या इज्जतीला जपते . पण त्याचा माझा नवरा गै रफायदा घे तोय याला आता खूप कंर्टाळली आहे माझा आज वाढस्मिदवस आहे परं तु माझ्या नवयाने मला स्मिवष सु द्धा केले नाही तर इतरांचे फोन कशाला घे ऊ त्यांना त्यां च्या मै स्मितर् णीकडे बोलायला वे ळ असतो. मी ज्या बे डरूम मध्ये झोपले तर तो दुसऱ्या बे डरूम मध्ये जाऊन झोपतो. माझी अपु लीकीने कधी चौकशी करत नाही मला जगण्यात काही अर्थ नाही अशी रडल्या आवाजात बोलत होती त्यावे ळी मी स्मितची समजूत काढली त्यानं तर मी स्मितच्या नवऱ्याला फोन करून अपूचा आज वाढस्मिदवस असताना तू स्मितला का स्मिवष केले नाहीस असे स्मिवचारले त्यावे ळी त्यांनी जाऊदे स्मितची ने हमीचीच नार्टके असतात असे रागाने म्हणाला......""
8. The police has recorded the statement of witness during the information which includes the statement of the son (Shreedaya) of Petitioner No.1 and the deceased. His statement is part of the charge- sheet which is annexed in the present proceedings at page no. 109. In the said statement, the son Shreedaya has mentioned that on 5 th February, 2019 when his mother was taken to hospital, his father had KVM WP 2841 OF 2019.odt handed over the mobile phone of his mother to him and while checking the said mobile phone, he came across a message which reads as under :-

9. The police in their reply to the bail application, a copy of which is annexed to the charge-sheet has specifically stated that Petitioner No.1 has deleted WhatsApp messages and photographs from the mobile phone of the deceased. Hence, a vital part of evidence has been destroyed by Petitioner No.1, which attracts the provisions of Section 201 of the Indian Penal Code. The police has further stated that Petitioner Nos. 1 and 2 have instigated the deceased to commit suicide. They have further stated that though the deceased has consumed poison, the container from which the poison was consumed, is not recovered and the police has an apprehension that the Accused has destroyed the same. The police has also doubt about the prima facie medical treatment given to the deceased, by the brother of Petitioner No.1, was not proper.

KVM WP 2841 OF 2019.odt

10. The police has also obtained laboratory analysis conclusion and report of Directorate of Forensic Science Laboratory. So also, they obtained CDR of the mobile number of the deceased and the Accused. The son of the deceased has mentioned that he was staying with the Informant, who is his mother's sister as he was studying in 10th standard. Therefore, the theory put up by the Petitioners that the Informant due to difference in political ideology and out of ulterior motives has filed complaint before police against the Petitioners, according to us in highly unbelievable. Print outs of the WhatsApp messages between Petitioner No.1 and Petitioner No.2 are annexed to the charge-sheet, which are enclosed at page no. 76.

11. As far as the decision referred by Petitioners in case of Meenabai Deepak Mahale & Ors. (supra) of the Division Bench of this Court is concerned, the facts of that case were very different. In the said case, the brother of the deceased wife had roped in, the husband of the deceased alongwith his relatives. In the said proceedings, based on the statement of the daughter of the deceased, the Division Bench came to the conclusion that ingredients of offence punishable under Sections KVM WP 2841 OF 2019.odt 306, 498A, 323, 504 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code are not made out.

12. In the present proceedings, the deceased has committed suicide on her birthday. Her son was studying in 10 th standard and staying with his mother's sister (eko""kh)/Informant, who has made a categorical statement with the police during investigation that he had checked the WhatsApp message on his mother's mobile. The said WhatsApp message has been reproduced in the earlier part of the judgment. Hence, the observations made in the judgment of Meenabai Deepak Mahale & Ors. (supra) will not be applicable to the present proceedings.


13. The Supreme Court in the judgments of (i) State of Haryana & Ors. vs. Ch. Bhajan Lal & Ors., AIR 1992 SC 604, (ii) Rajeev Kourav vs. Baisahab & others, (2020) 3 SCC 317 and (iii) Kaptan Singh vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and others, (2021) 9 SCC 35 , have held that exercise of powers under section 482 CrPC to quash the proceedings is an exception and not a rule. Appreciation of evidence is not permissible at the stage of quashing of proceedings is exercise of KVM WP 2841 OF 2019.odt powers under Section 482 CrPC.


14. In the recently reported judgment of CBI vs. Aryan Singh, AIR 2023 SC 1987, the Supreme Court has held that while examining the power under Section 482, the High Court should not conduct a mini trial. Similarly in the judgment of State of Odisha vs. Pratima Mohanty and others, (2022) 16 SCC 703, the Supreme Court has held that once the charge-sheet is filed, the High Court should be reluctant to quash the complaint. Paragraph no.8.2 of the judgment reads as under :


8.2 It is trite that the power of quashing should be exercised sparingly and with circumspection and in rare cases. As per the settled proposition of law while examining an FIR/complaint quashing of which is sought, the court cannot embark upon any enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness of allegations made in the FIR/complaint. Quashing of a complaint/FIR should be an exception rather than any ordinary rule. Normally the criminal proceedings should not be quashed in exercise of powers under section 482 CrPC when after a thorough investigation the charge-sheet has been filed. At the stage of discharge and/or considering the application under section 482 CrPC the courts are not required to go into the merits of the allegations and/or evidence in detail as if conducting the mini-trial. As held by this court the powers under section 482 CrPC are very wide, but conferment of wide power requires the court to be more cautious. It casts all onerous and KVM WP 2841 OF 2019.odt more diligent duty on the Court.
[Emphasis supplied]

15. In the present proceedings, the charge-sheet has been already filed on 31st December 2019 and the police have recorded the statement of 35 witnesses, copies of which are enclosed with the charge-sheet and forms part of the records of the present proceedings. As this Court had granted stay to the trial proceedings by Order dated 17th February 2020 the matter before the Trial Court did not proceed further.


16. After considering the contents of FIR and the various documents on record attached to the FIR, and the Charge-sheet, we are satisfied that it constitutes the ingredients of the offences alleged. Taking into account the law as laid down by the Supreme Court in the judgments referred above, we find that there is no merit in the present Writ Petition and the same deserves to be dismissed. Hence, the following order :-

ORDER
(i) The Writ Petition stands dismissed.
KVM WP 2841 OF 2019.odt

(ii) Needless to state, any observations made herein are only for the purposes of deciding the Writ Petition only and would have no bearing on the final adjudication of the proceedings.

JUDMENT
        Challenge in this criminal appeal is to the conviction and sentence dated 16-12-2006 passed in Sessions Case No.154 of 2006 by the Additional District and Sessions Court/ Fast Track Court - I, Erode.          
        2.        The schema of the case of the prosecution is that the accused is the husband of the deceased, by name Fathima Fairoz. On 18-10-2005, a person, who lent money has come to the house of the accused and directed the said Fathima Fairoz to execute a document, and due to that a tussle has arisen in between the accused and deceased.  The accused has attacked the said Fathima Fairoz in the presence of children and due to overtact of the accused, the said Fathima Fairoz has committed suicide.  After occurrence, the mother of the deceased, by name Mehabbunisa (P.W.1) has given a complaint and the same has been registered in Crime No.1380 of 2005 and marked as Ex-P1.  
        3.        On receipt of Ex-P1, the investigating officer, viz., P.W.10 has conducted investigation, examined connected witnesses and also made arrangements to conduct autopsy and accordingly, the Doctor by name, M. Loganathan, P.W.6, has conducted  post-mortem and he found the following external and internal injuries:

        ...Final Opinion (Cause of death of deceased)
        The deceased died of organophosphorous insecticide poisoning.""
The Post-mortem report has been marked as Ex-P5.
        4.        After transfer of P.W.10, his successor-in-office viz., P.W.11, has continued further investigation. After completing the same, laid a final report on the file of the Judicial Magistrate Court - II, Erode and the same has been taken on file, in P.R.C.No.4 of 2006.  
        5.        The Judicial Magistrate -II, Erode, after considering the facts that the offences alleged to have been committed by the accused are triable by Sessions Court, has committed the case to the Court of Sessions, Erode Division and taken on file in Sessions Case No.154 of 2006 and subsequently made over to the file of the Trial Court.
        6.        The Trial Court after hearing both sides and upon perusing the relevant records has framed first charge against the accused under Section 498A, IPC, second charge against him under Section 306, IPC and the same have been read over and explained to him. The accused has denied the charges and claimed to be tried.
        7.        On the side of the prosecution, P.Ws.1 to 11 have been examined and Exs-P1 to P14 and M.O.1 have been marked. 
        8.        When the accused has been questioned under Section 313, Cr.P.C., as respects the incriminating materials available in evidence against him, he denied his complicity in the crime.  No oral and documentary evidence have been adduced on the side of the accused.
        9.        The Trial Court after hearing both sides and upon perusing the relevant evidence available on record has found the accused guilty under Section 498A, IPC and sentenced him to undergo three years' rigorous imprisonment. The Trial Court has found the accused not guilty under Section 306, IPC.  Against the conviction and sentence imposed by the Trial Court under Section 498A, IPC, the present criminal appeal has been preferred at the instance of the accused, as appellant.  
        10.        The sum and substance of the case of the prosecution is that the accused is the husband of deceased, Fathima Fairoz. On 08-10-2005, one person, who lent money has come to the house of the accused and asked the deceased to execute a document in respect of  his loan and due to that, a miff has arisen between the accused and deceased. The accused in the presence of children has attacked the deceased and since the accused has attacked the deceased, she decided to put an end to her life and accordingly, on 09-10-2005 at about 2:00p.m., she committed  suicide. 
        11.        The learned counsel appearing for the appellant-accused has raised the following points so as to set aside the conviction and sentence passed against the appellant-accused:
        (a) Both P.Ws.1 and 3 are not at all eye-witnesses and their evidence cannot be believed in; (b) in the instant case, Section 498A, IPC is not attracted; (c) independent witnesses have not been examined.
        12.        In order to resile the contentions put-forth on the side of the appellant-accused, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor has contended that in the instant case, the mother of the deceased has been examined has P.W.1, and daughter of both the accused and the deceased, has been examined as P.W.3 and their specific evidence is that on the date of occurrence the accused has attacked the deceased. Even though, the accused has faced a charge under Section 306, IPC, the Trial Court has acquitted him and for the purpose of invoking Section 498-A, IPC, the prosecution is having ample evidence and the Trial Court after considering the enormous evidence available on the side of the prosecution has rightly found the accused guilty under Section 498A, IPC and therefore, conviction and sentence passed by the Trial Court under the said Section are not liable to be interfered with.  
        13.        Before contemplating the rival submissions made on either side, the Court has to look into Section 498A, IPC and the same reads as follows:
        ""498A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty.Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine. Explanation.For the purpose of this section, cruelty means(a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; .....""
A cursory look of the said Section would clearly go to show that even if a wilful conduct on the part of the accused would affect life, limb or health of the affected person it would come within the contour of the said section.  
        14.        The defacto complainant has been examined as P.W.1 and her specific evidence is that the accused has attacked the deceased.  Likewise, the daughter of both the accused and deceased, by name, Ayisha Nasreen has been examined as P.W.3 and her specific evidence is that during the course of occurrence her father has attacked her mother.  Ofcourse, it is true that both P.Ws.1 and 3 are closely related to the deceased.  Simply because they are closely related to the deceased, their evidence cannot be eschewed nor discarded. From the evidence given by P.Ws.1 and 3, the Court can very well come to a conclusion that in the place of occurrence, the accused has attacked the deceased and the act of the accused would definitely affect limb or health of the deceased and therefore, it is needless to say that the act of the accused would come within the purview of Section 498A, IPC.  Therefore, the first and second contentions put-forth on the side of the appellant-accused cannot be accepted.  
        15.        Now, the Court has to look into the third contention put-forth on the side of the appellant-accused. It is true that in the instant case with regard to attack alleged to have been made by the accused on the person of the deceased, no independent witness has been examined and that itself would not militate the case of the prosecution.  Further, one Manzoor has spoken about the quarrel, which has arisen in between the accused and deceased.  Therefore, viewing from any angle, the Court cannot come to a conclusion, that the appellant-accused has had no connection with the offence alleged to have been committed under Section 498A, IPC.  The learned counsel appearing for the appellant-accused has drawn the attention of this Court to the following decisions:
        (i)        2007 (9) SCC 721 (Appasaheb and another Vs. State of Maharashtra), wherein the Honourable Supreme Court has held that since essential ingredients of Section 304-B, IPC have not been established, the concerned accused cannot be muttered with liability under the said Section.  
        (ii)        2010 (7) SCC 667 (Preeti Gupta Vs. State of Jharkhand) wherein the Honourable Supreme Court has held that the relatives of husband have been living in  different  places and under the said circumstances, they cannot be unnecessarily roped in, in criminal proceedings.
        16.        In the instant case, as pointed out earlier, the specific contention put-forth on the side of the prosecution is that in the place of occurrence, the accused has attacked the deceased.  For the purpose of proving the said aspect, the prosecution has adduced an unimpugnable evidence, by way of examining P.Ws.1 and 3 and their evidence cannot be rejected merely on the ground of relationship and further, this Court has already observed that the act of the appellant-accused would come within the purview of Section 498A, IPC.  Therefore, viewing from any angle, there is no incertitude in coming to the conclusion that the appellant-accused has committed an offence punishable under Section 498A, IPC.  The Trial Court after considering the available evidence on record has rightly invited the conviction and sentence against the accused, under the said Section.  
        17.        In view of the foregoing elucidation of both factual and legal premise, this Court has not found any infirmity nor illegality in the conviction passed by the Trial Court.  
        18.        The learned counsel appearing for the appellant as a residual contention contended that the appellant-accused is the husband of the deceased and therefore, some leniency may be shown in awarding punishment.
        19.        The Trial Court has awarded three years rigorous imprisonment against the appellant-accused under the said Section. Considering the fact that the occurrence has taken place in the year 2005 and also considering the relationship between the appellant and deceased and also P.W.3, this Court is of the view to modify the substantive sentence as stated infra.
        In fine, this criminal appeal is allowed in part.  The conviction passed under Section 498A, IPC by the Trial Court is confirmed. But, the sentence imposed by the Trial Court is modified as follows:
        ""The appellant-accused is sentenced to undergo six months' rigorous imprisonment, instead of three years.""
        The Trial Court is directed to take suitable steps so as to immure the accused-appellant in prison to serve the remaining period of sentence.

			     O R D E R		
The accused 1 to 3 in CC.211/2012 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate No.1, Poonamallee, are the petitioners herein. This criminal revision is filed against the order made in CMP.No.3942/2012, thereby dismissing their petition for discharge from the alleged charges under Sections 498(A), 406, 506(i) IPC r/w 109 IPC.

2.Few facts, which are relevant for consideration herein are as follows:

The petitioners herein are the husband and parents in-laws of the defacto complainant by name D.Nandhini, who is the second respondent herein. The marriage between the first petitioner and the second respondent was solemnized on 22.1.2007 at Chennai as per Hindu rituals, rites and customs. After marriage, the wife continued to live in her parents' house for continuing her studies and the husband was on visiting terms and she became pregnant and Valakappu function was held. While so, misunderstanding arose between the two and they started quarreling with each other, which compelled the first petitioner/husband to approach K4 Women Police Station and also compelled to issue legal notice on 29.1.2008 calling upon the wife to resume the matrimonial relationship and the same was replied by the wife. Then, the wife gave birth to female child. Even thereafter, the parties did not join together. The husband ultimately approached the court for dissolution of the marriage between the first petitioner and the second respondent in OP.3719/2008. The same was followed by the petition under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 by the wife for restitution of conjugal rights in OP.3808/2008. Both the parties raised various allegations against each other in their respective petitions. The wife also came forward with a police complaint dated 21.2.2012 before the Assistant commissioner, All women Police Station, Vadapalani, Chennai against the husband and in-laws for their alleged acts of cruelty and criminal intimidation for complying with the demand of dowry. The same was registered in W27 All Women Police Station, Vadapalani FIR in Cr.No.11/2012 for the offences under sections 498A, 406 and 506(i) IPC and Section 4 of Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act. The same was investigated and culminated as CC.No.211/2012 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate No.I, Poonamallee.
3.On service of summons, the accused 1 to 3 came forward with Crl.MP.No.3942 of 2012 for their discharge mainly on the ground that the materials available do not make out any case much less prima face case for the offences as referred to above and the offences are barred under limitation under section 469 Cr.P.C as the allegations narrated in the complaint are related to the year 2007 and there was no cordial relationship between the defacto complainant and the petitioners from 11.12.2007. The same was opposed by the prosecution by filing counter with serious objections to discharge A1 to A3 from the charges. The trial court dismissed the petition on the ground that there is prima facie offence made out against all the accused and there are lot of triable issues involved in this case. Hence, this criminal revision by the accused 1 to 3 before this court.

4.Heard the rival submissions made on both sides.

5.As already referred to, the accused are charged for the offences under Sections 498A, 406, 506(i) r/w 109 IPC. As per the allegations raised in the final report, the facts constituting the offences as referred to above are as follows: All the accused, due to non satisfaction of dowry brought by the defacto complainant, joined together and demanded balance 24 sovereigns of jewels from her parents and they treated her in a cruel manner and several times, they beaten her and that the first accused, at the instigation of the accused 2 and 3 picked up quarrel with the defacto complainant and the defacto complainant tolerated all the harassment and she was not provided any basic needs and she was insisted not to close her bed room, while she was sleeping and the accused 2 and 3 did not allow her to serve food to her husband and not allowed her to speak to her husband and on 11.12.2007, when she served food to the first accused, other accused were beaten her in cruel manner without considering her pregnancy and drove her from the matrimonial house and when the same was questioned and when they were requested to allow her in the matrimonial house, they did not allow her to do so and several mediation in this regard ended in fail. It further says that the first accused did not speak to and did not show any love and affection to the wife and she was isolated by all the accused and was treated as servant. The acts as stated above, according to the complainant, constitute the offence punishable under section 498A IPC.

6.As rightly argued by the learned counsel for the petitioners, the acts stated above are allegedly committed by A1 to A3 during the complainant's stay in the matrimonial house. As per the allegations contained in the complaint and charge sheet, the second respondent/wife was driven out of the matrimonial house on 11.12.2007, whereas the present complaint came to be lodged on 21.2.2012 and FIR was registered on 25.2.2012 i.e., nearly 4= years thereafter.

7.According to the learned counsel for the petitioners, as the punishment prescribed under section 498A IPC is imprisonment upto 3 years with fine and as per Section 468 Cr.P.C no court shall take cognizance of the offence after expiry of 3 years in respect of the offence punishable for the term of one year and not exceeding 3 years, the cognizance of the compliant for the offence under section 498A IPC is barred by limitation and is bad in law. The learned counsel for the petitioners also relied on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in (2010) 1 SCC (Cri) 1015 (Manju Ram Kalita v. State of Assam) to the effect that no case under section 498A IPC is made out.

8.Per contra, the learned counsel for the second respondent would vehemently argue that as the demand for more valuables and cash persisted even after her being driven out of the matrimonial house and as the latest demand was during 2012 and as the complaint was based on cause of action arose during 2012, the complaint filed on 21.2.2012 and registered on 25.2.2012 and was taken cognizance in the same year, are well within the time and are not hit by limitation. This Court is not inclined to accept the contention so raised on the side of the second respondent/wife for the following reasons.

9.First of all, there is absolutely no allegation either in the complaint or in the final report regarding the continuing demand for more valuables and cash. It is evident from the complaint, copy of which is enclosed at pages 19 to 22 of typed set dated 30.4.2013 filed by the petitioner. There is no allegation in the complaint regarding any demand for dowry or any harassment or ill-treatment of the wife in her parents house after 11.12.2007. The threat thrown at her during 2012 was to give consent for second marriage and against her claim for maintenance for herself and on behalf of the child and not otherwise. Thus, there is absolutely no allegation about continuing act of cruelty or harassment to attract the mischief under Section 498A IPC between 11.12.2007, the date on which she was allegedly driven out of the matrimonial house and 25.2.2012 the date on which the complaint came to be registered. As rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for the petitioners, the complainant has also not furnished satisfactory explanation for the delay in lodging the complaint, after 4 = years particularly much after the institution of divorce petition by the husband and the petition for restitution of conjugal rights by the wife. As the materials available herein would disclose the act of cruelty and harassment as defined under section 498A IPC, before 11.12.2007, the complaint regarding the same during 2012 after the period of limitation of three years is certainly out of time and bad in law and is hence not maintainable.

10.Regarding the offence under Section 506(i) r/w 109 IPC, the contention raised by the accused is that the allegations are vague and bald in nature and not distinct and specific to enable the accused to meet out the same in proper and effective manner and the same amounts to abuse of process of court. In this regard, the allegation raised in the final report is to be looked into. The same reads as if the accused on 10.2.2012 and 17.2.2012 threatened the defacto complainant for her consent for divorce and for second marriage, failing which, to face dire consequences for herself and the child. While the complaint says that the threats on 10.2.2012 and 17.2.2012 were made in front of the school and while she was going to school respectively, the final report simply proceeds as if the threat was made on 10.2.2012 and 17.2.2012. Neither the complaint nor the final report does mention anything about the time and the exact place at which threat was made as contemplated under Section 212 Cr.P.C. It is clearly provided under Section 212(1) Cr.P.C that the charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and place of the alleged offence and the person against whom or the thing in respect of which, it was committed as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged.

11.Whereas, the allegations raised either in the complaint or the final report do not sufficiently state the time and the place at which occurrence is made. As rightly argued by the learned counsel for the petitioners, without such material particulars as referred to above, the accused is unable to defend the case and to effectively meet the charges framed against them by raising proper and valid defence. Thus, the manner in which the allegations raised without relevant particulars would only compel this court to hold that the accused are deprived of their opportunity for properly defending themselves and the same amounts to abuse of process of law and the same vitiates the prosecution case and is sufficient enough to discharge the accused from the charge punishable under section 506(i) IPC. Even otherwise, the threat having been allegedly made by A1 in the absence of any allegation against A2 and A3, their inclusion as abettors for the offence under section 506(i) r/w 109 IPC is certainly not maintainable and is likely to cause serious prejudice to the accused, as such, the accused 1 to 3 are entitled to discharge from the charge under section 506(i) r/w 109 IPC.

12.The learned counsel for the petitioners has also relied on the following decisions regarding the act of criminal intimidation by raising vague and bald allegations: (i)(2008) 3 MLJ (Crl) 776 (Rajan v. State rep. by Inspector of Policer, Central Crime Branch, Tiruppur and (ii)(2008) 3 MLJ (Crl) 929 (Prakash Bachraj Jain and another v. Mani Textile Traders rep. by its Partner, Babu (a) Boommannan, Komarapalayam, Tiruchengodu Taluk, Namakkal District), wherein, our High court is of the view that vague and bald allegations of threat do not give rise to offence under Section 506(ii) IPC and the complaint filed and the proceedings initiated are clear case of abuse of process of court and liable to be quashed. Our High court has in (2008) 3 MLJ (Crl) 776 (cited supra) referred to other two judgments of our High Court and Punjab and Haryana High Court reported in (1988) 1 MLJ (Crl) 54 (Nobel Mohandass v. State) and (2002) 2 CC Cases (P&H) 320 (Usha Bala v. State of Punjab), wherein, both the High courts have held that empty threats does not prima facie mean that the case under section 506 IPC is made out and threat should be a real one and not just a mere word and when the person uttering it does not exactly mean what he says and also when the person at whom threat is launched does not feel threatened actually. Such view is squarely applicable to the facts of the present case and herein also no case is made out against the petitioners for the offence under Section 506(i) r/w 109 IPC.

13.The remaining charge to be considered herein is for the offence under Section 406 IPC. Here again, the complaint contains no allegations in this regard and also in section 161 Cr.P.C statement of the witnesses. What is stated by them is that jewels and Seethana jewels and articles were given to her only at the time of marriage. As far as the final report is concerned, it says that the accused did not return Seethana jewels weighing 30 sovereigns and all the belongings of the complainant were taken away for his own use and no prima facie case is made out against the accused for the offence under section 406 IPC.

14.Above all, other ground on which the accused were questioned the legality and validity for proceeding against them for the offences as referred to above is mis-joinder of cause of action. As far as the offence under Section 406 IPC is concerned, it cannot be disputed that the limitation for taking cognizance of the complaint runs from the date on which the request for return of jewels is first refused. There is absolutely no averment either in the complaint or Section 161 Cr.P.C statement regarding the date on which the request for return was made and was refused. Further, the learned counsel for the petitioner has also by relying on the authority of Calcutta High court reported in 1994 Crl.LJ 422 (Dinabandhu Banerjee v. Nandini Mukherjee) argued about the want of circumstances under which the continuance of user or repetition of user of the articles is transformed into dishonest misappropriation or criminal breach of trust. For better appreciation, para 10 of the judgment is extracted herunder:

""10.Now let us look to the language of the relevant parts of Section 403 and Section 405 of the Indian Penal Code for ascertaining whether the offence of dishonest misappropriation or for that matter, criminal breach of trust is a continuing offence. Dishonest misappropriation or conversion to one's own use is the crux of the offence of dishonest misappropriation punishable under Section 403 IPC. Now, the dictionary meaning of the word misappropriate is 'to put to a wrong use; to take dishonestly for oneself' (vide, Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary). The dictionary meaning of the word appropriate is 'to make to be the private property of anyone, to take to oneself as one's own' (ibid). It is thus evident that every wrong use will not necessarily be misappropriation. Misappropriation rather marks the point where the transition takes place from non-offending possession, control or use to offending or dishonest possession, control or use. It is this transitional phenomenon and this process of transformation which converts the possession or use of a property to dishonest misappropriation. Once this transitional phenomenon, that is, the process of transformation is complete and dishonest misappropriation takes place the subsequent wrong user of the property or the continuance of such wrong user is not a part of the phenomenon of misappropriation although such continuance of user or repetition of user may be also morally and legally wrong. But then such subsequent wrong user or continuance of wrong user or retention of the property wrongfully will not be a continuance or repetition of the offence of dishonest misappropriation as defined in Section 403. The same feature of transitional phenomenon of converting the complexion of the possession or user marks the precipitation and completion of the offence of criminal breach of trust as defined in Section 405. By definition the offence of dishonest misappropriation or for that matter, criminal breach of trust must be tainted at the point of its commission by a process of transformation by a transitional phenomenon converting the complexion of the possession, user or dealing of the property and once that transitional phenomenon is over and the conversion is complete by answering at that amount the definition of dishonest misappropriation or criminal breach of trust as contained in the relevant section of the Indian Penal Code, the subsequent continuance of the possession, user or dealing of the property even if it is morally wrong and legally untenable will be lacking the transitional factor of contemporaneous conversion of the complexion of the user from one type to a different type and therefore it cannot be said that the subsequent user is a continuing offence of the same type which was initially committed in changing the complexion of user. In order to constitute a continuing offence, the acts complained of must at every moment of continuance reflect all the ingredients necessary for constituting the offence. As we have seen conversion or transitional phenomenon of complexional change of the user being one of the salient ingredients of the offence of dishonest misappropriation or for that matter, criminal breach of trust, such transitional phenomenon obviously cannot recur or endure after the conversion or change of complexion of the user is complete. In the circumstances, it cannot be said that retention or subsequent dealing of the misappropriated property, although wrong, will constitute any such offence as stated above because the definition of such offence does not make such wrongful subsequent use of continued part or a repetition of the offence. I have therefore no hesitation to hold that the offence of dishonest misappropriation defined in section 403 or the offence of criminal breach of trust defined in Section 405 IPC is not a continuing offence because such offence, by definition takes place where an act is committed once and for all.""
If the same view is applied to the facts of the present case insofar as the offence under section 406 IPC is concerned, no ingredients for the offences of dishonest misappropriation and criminal breach of trust are prima facie made out against the petitioners herein.

15.Another point, which is sought to be argued before this court is by questioning the maintainability of the proceedings on mis-joinder of cause of action. It is contended by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the acts of cruelty and criminal intimidation and the acts of misappropriation and criminal breach of trust are different incidents taken at different place and not in the same course of action and the police is not hence justified in registering one FIR and there is no possibility of conducting joint trial of all the offences together and the accused have the right to plead that they are prejudiced by such wrong trial. The learned counsel for the petitioners in support of such contention also relied on the decision of this court reported in 2009 Crl.LJ 3872 (Ambujam v. Ayyasamy and others) wherein, all the accused were charged for the offences under sections 498A IPC and A1 was charged for the offence under section 506(ii) IPC. The criminal trial ended in an order of acquittal of the accused. Against which, the criminal revision came to be filed. The learned brother judge, by resorting to Section 219 Cr.P.C was of the view that there is no possibility of conducting joint trial of both the offences as both the incidents are different and taken place at different places at different point of time and are not in the course of same transaction and disinclined to interfere with the order of acquittal. The same view can be equally applied to the facts of the present case.

16.Viewing from any angle, this Court is inclined to hold that there is no material and sufficient ground to proceed against the accused for the offences as referred to above. However, the trial court without duly appreciating the objections raised in the discharge petition, in the manner as discussed, committed serious error in dismissing the discharge petition, as such, the impugned order suffers from serious irregularity and infirmity, thereby seriously prejudiced accused warranting interference by this Court.

17.In the result, this Criminal Revision is allowed and the order dated 28.3.2013 made in Crl.M.P.No.3942 of 2012 in CC.No.211 of 2012 on the file of Judicial Magistrate No.I, Ponnamallee stands set aside. The petitioners/accused 1 to 3 are discharged from the charges levelled against them. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petitions are closed.

	24090 dated 25.11.2013
Both the criminal original petitins are filed by the accused 4 to 8 in CC. 141 and 149 on the file of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate George Town, Chennai. Both the private complaints are filed by the respondent/complainant for proceeding against M/s.V.P.Muthaiah Pillai Meenakshi Trust (ii)M/s.S.Palaniselvi Chairman and (iii)V.P.M.Managing Director of the Trust arrayed as the accused A2 to 3 and the petitioners are herein are the first accused A1 trust arrayed as A4 to A8 for the offence under section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act.

The complaint proceeds as if the first accused availed loan of Rs.60 lakhs from the complainant and the accused 2 to 8 who are the trustees of the first accused taking part of ... day today affairs of the .. issued 5 cheques bearing 860064 dated 13.2.2007 for Rs.2 lakhs, to 861010, 86001066 to 861010 each for Rs.2 lakhs on various dates between 7.4.2000 and 7.7.2000 towards part payment of the loan and the complainant presented the cheque for collection and the cheque were contrary to the assurance given by the ... given for presentation returned unpaid for want of sufficient funds on 24.9.2007 and the complainant issued notice on 27.9.2007 calling upon the accused to repaid entire amount covered under the cheque within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice and the accused refused to receive the notice and the accused refused the notice and thereby committed the offence punishable under section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act.

Both the complaints are filed with the allegations as stated above along with cheque in question bearing Nos., return memo and acknowledgment and power of attorney. While number of Cheques involved in Cc.1840 is five in bearing numbers 8867 1010 of various dates between 7.4.2007, 28.4.2007 and 26.4.2007, the cheque involved in CC.1484/2011 is single one cheque bearing no.87 dated 13.2.2007. Both the complaints proceeds as if the first accused availed loan of Rs.60 lakhs from the complainant and the accused 2 to 8 and first accused issued 5 cheques and single cheque respectively with the assurance the cheques will be duly honoured on presentation. It is also stated herein that the accused 2 to 8 are trustees of the trust taking active part in the trust. However, the cheques are issued only by the Managing Director other Managing trustee and not by present any of the managing trustee. Herein. The present trustees are arrayed as accused only on the basis of the alelgations raised i the complaint that they are activitley pariticpating in the day today affairs of the trust. The present cril.o.p. Came to be field on behal fof turstee /A4 to 8 minly on the ground that the complaitn is breft of particularly regardign the maner in which the petitioners are particiapted in the activities of the trust and loan snd transaction which si cause of action for fling he complaint. The learned cousnelfor the petitioenr has also cited the in supprt of her contention thqat mere genral or valgue alelgatiosn regardig partiic of the trustee and speific avermnet, clear and unambi or allegation with respect to the role played by the truste the maner inw hich they are resonsible for the affiarsif and conduct of the trust are necessary in ordr to make them liable for the criminal offence under section 138 of N.I.Act.

In all the cases cited above, the Hon'bel sC and ou hih court are pleased to quash the proceedings for the absence of averment in the complaint or petiion in this regard. The SC is of the view in the idetbical situation that 2007 SCC 693 has in para 14 and 15 specifically under the identical situation observed that though some allegations to satisfy the requirement under secion 139 might have been in the petition, it is obligatory on the prt of th complainant with the view to make a director of the company vicariously liable for the acts of the company and in the absence of any alelgatiosn as to hwo the director is responsible for the dishonour of cheque, they do not rquire for the ..and they do not dislcosed against the director. It is staed therein that a person is vicarou con the par tof the company in the event of the codtiiona 141 stands satisfied and for the aforementioned purpose, a strict concession would be necessary. The Supreme court 2005 8 SCC cases in para 10 and 12 observed that every person shall fall not within the ambit of section 141 and those person who are .. and resonabiel for the donct at the time of liable will be liable for criminal action and theliablity arisis on the conduct, omission and not merely on accoutn holding an office or in a company. It is furthe osberved in 141 of the Act. The compkaint must disclose necessary facts which make a person liable and it is necewsary to specifialy aver the comoplai was committed the accused fore sponsibel for the busienss, which is one of the ssential requriemnt sof the,,without such averment being mad ein the compaitn,t he equrement ofcompalitn cnanot be said to be satisfied. It is also observedin pra 10 that of criminal liability means serious so afar a person sougth to be made is ocncrne,d only persons aid to be connected with the commison ofc rim can be subjected to action and director of company cannto be demed to be in fhacr fgor the conduct of the bsusiens seither in genral or at the time relevant point of time. Simialry principle mad ein 2007 wherein it is held mere being Driector is not suficient enough to cast vicarious liability and variocu libail mut be pleaded andproved and cnanot be inferred and mere alelgations regarding ithe director particiaptation, would not give rise to interference that the appellant is responsible for the day today ffaris fo the compnay. The our jdugements appliedying the views discussed and relied on catenna of judgment on this aspect and applying the same view of the Hon;'ble supreme court mere or general directors at relevant point responsible or conduct of the busienss of to hold them vairouc fro the offence under section 138 the same vewis forcibley applicable in the case of trustees, in repsect of whom no specif averment in the complaint in the manenr as conentplated undr alw and as laid down by the Surpeme court and our High court. Under such ricustamnces, applyign theprincplclaidd own, is inlciend to quash the proceedings agaisnt the petitioners 4 to 8 whoa re the accused 4 to 8 herein In the result, both the crin orig allwod bty cimrinla stands quashed.

The accused in CC.713/2001 and the appellant in CA.33. is the revision petitioner herein. The present petition is filed against his conviction and sentence imposed on him for the offence under sections 304A, 338IPC and Section 184 Motor vehicles Act by the trial court as confirmed by the lowe appellate court.

The case of the prosecution is that the petitioner/accused drove his Mahindra jeep in south to north direction in LB Road and dashed against MTC bus, which was coming in the same road on north to south direction on 9.30pm on ... and then truned the jeep extreme left side of theroad, and hit the auto risk parked near payment and due such impact, the auto rakcw hit another parked vehciel. Jeep...dahsed against two pedestrian frome ast to west directiona dn the jeep went on rigth side and dashed against MTC bus, and due to the hit, two pedestrians were thrown away and one the pedestrians by name Krishnamorothyded on the spot and another fainted with bleeding injruei, thereby the accused committed the ocfecne as stated supra.

The case was culminated as CC.713/2001. The prosecution during trial examined the eye witnesses, mahazar witnesses, post mortem doctor and IOs as PW1 to PW10 and produced post mortem report, MV reports for tata sumo car to MTC bus, auto rickshaw, Mahindra jeep, complaint, FIR, observation mahazar, accident register as Exs.p1 to P11.

The trial court on the basis of the available records, found the driverof the mahaindra jepe of the offences 30.. and 184 Motor vehciel Act. Aggrieved against the same, the accused preferred CA.1326/2006 and the lower appellate court on the basis of same set of evidence confirmed the finding of the trial court and dismissed the appeal. Hence, this criminal revision by the accused before this court.

Heard both sides and perused the records.

The learned counsel for the petitioner would strenuously argue agaisnt the corrextness of the finding rendered by the trialc ort it is sought to be argued that the finding rndred by the trc and as confirmed by the lac is based on no proper evidence. whereas, the learned gA would draw the attention of this court to the evidence adudced by the eye witensses particularly, PW1 and PW2, PW4 and PW5 whoare si noen else than the driver abd conductor of one of the Mtc buses ,PW5 PW6 driver cum owner of tata sumo car and PW7 driver of another MTC bus. MV reprots relating teo the vehciels as refered to would greater extent supprot the prosecution case erearding damage caused to the vheice. The combined aproeciation of the oral evidence as referred toa bvoe, would categorically depose about the rash and englgient manenr in which the vehicle was driven by the accused would lead no dout in the mind of the court about the truth of the prosecution cse. The manenr in which the vehciel driven by the accused hitting against other vehcielq dn other pedestrians would speak about the overt act attributed agisn thte accused and this court finds no erore or irinriigula in the finding rndred by tehcoruts belwo.

     2. The criminal law has been set into motion based on the

first information statement of Smt. PUSHPA .M. The gist of the

prosecution case is that CW-1       married Accused No.1 on 07-11-

2011 as per customs in the presence of well wishers. During the

marriage the parent's of the CW1 gave 74grms of gold and spent

Rs. 7,00,000/- towards the marriage. After the marriage when the

CW1 was residing with the accused the Accused No.1 used to

consume alcohol and use to abuse and assault the CW1. As per the

demands of the accused the parent's of CW1 gave Rs.80,000/-, the

Accused No.1 to 3 pledged the ornaments of the CW1 and used to

utilize her salary. The Accused No.1 to 4 demand the CW1 to bring

Rs.2,00,000/- as additional dowry in order to invest in making

Ganesha Idols. When CW1 refused to get the amount the Accused

No.1 to 4 have abused and assaulted her. On 08-12-2014 at

1.00PM pushed her out of gate and assaulted her on stomach. That

on 20-07-2017 the Accused No.1 to 5 with common intention

demanded CW1 to bring further dowry of Rs.2,00,000/-, tortured

her both mentally and physically. Based on the information of Smt.

Pushpa, a case in Cr.No.38/2017 came to be registered against the

accused No.1 to 5 for the aforesaid offences.
                                     4

                                                               C.C.No.26228/2018
     3.   After   completion   of       the   investigation,     the   P.SI   of

Basavanagudi Women P.S. has filed chargesheet against accused

No.1 to 5 for the aforesaid offences. On receipt of charge sheet, this

court took   cognizance of the alleged offences. Pursuant to the

issuance and service of summons, accused No.1 to 5 entered

appearance and were enlarged on bail. The prosecution papers was

furnished to the accused No.1 to 5 as required U/s.207 of Cr.P.C.


     4. Before framing charge an opportunity of being heard was

provided to the accused No.1 to 5 and after hearing them and the

prosecution and as there was sufficient materials, the charge for

the aforesaid offences was framed and same was read over to the

accused No.1 to 5 in the language known to them, to which, the

accused No.1 to 5 pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The

plea of the accused No.1 to 5 was recorded. Thereafter, the matter

was set down for prosecution evidence.


     5. In order to prove the charges, the prosecution has

examined PW-1 to 5 and got marked Ex.P.1 to P.8 documents. The

Statement of Accused       as required U/s. 313 of Cr.P.C., was

recorded. The accused No.1 to 5 denied the incriminating
                                5

                                                     C.C.No.26228/2018
circumstances appearing against them and have stated they have

no defence evidence and nothing to say.

     6. Heard arguments on both the sides. I have Perused the

materials on record.

     7. The following points arise for my determination:-

     1) Whether the prosecution proves beyond all reasonable
     doubt that the accused No.1 to 5 caused physical and
     mental cruelty to the complainant in demand of dowry
     and   thereby accused have committed the offences
     punishable U/s.498A of IPC. & Sec.3 & 4 of D.P.Act..?

     2) what order?

     8. My finding to the above points are as under:-

     Point No.1 ........In the Negative.
     Point No.2........ As per final order, for the following:

                           REASONS

     9. POINT No.1 :- It is the fundamental principle of criminal

jurisprudence that the prosecution has to prove its case beyond

reasonable doubt. In order to bring home the guilt of the accused

No.1 to 5, the prosecution has examined PW 1 to 5 got marked

Ex.P.1 to Ex.P8 documents.

                               11

                                                   C.C.No.26228/2018

CW-1 to get money for doing Ganesha Idol business since Accused

deposed that they have provided household things to Accused no.1

and CW-1. Accused no.1 was taking her salary. As Accused no.1

was coming home daily by consuming alcohol, CW-1 lodged

to CW-1, assaulted on her stomach with legs and drove her away

was brought to their house. He has given statement before police .
                                12

                                                    C.C.No.26228/2018
He identifies   the Accused. During his cross examination he has

admitted that they gave everything to CW1 and accused No.1 as per

gave gold to CW1 as per customs. He admits that except for

accused No.1 quarreling with CW1.


     13.   CW-9 Sathyavathi was examined as        PW-4. She has

deposed in her examination in chief that on 27-12-2017 she took

up the case records from CW-8 and continued investigation. On 18-

7-2018 she recorded statement of CW 2 to 5 and after completion

of investigation, she submitted Chargesheet against accused.


     14.   CW-8 M.C.Kavitha, ACP, Whitefield sub division was

examined as PW-5. She has deposed in her examination-in-chief

that when she was in station        CW-1 appeared in station    and

lodged complaint. She registered a case in crime No.38/2017 and

submitted FIR to the court. On the same day, she obtained

marriage photos and wedding invitation from CW-1. On 12-8-2017
                                 13

                                                    C.C.No.26228/2018
at the place shown by CW-1 she conducted spot mahzar as per

Ex.P.2.

     15. The above being the evidence on record it would be

appropriate to see whether the prosecution can prove its case

beyond reasonable doubt.

     16. The only witnesses who are examined by the prosecution

are the PW1 to PW3 who are blood relations. There evidence has to

be relied with lot of caution as there are chances that they may

implicate the accused in this case.

     17. In respect of the demand of dowry and giving of dowry at

the time of the marriage is concerned the PW2 and 3 have stated

that they had given gold ornaments as per their customs. Such

being the case, when any gold jewelry and any articles are given at

the time of marriage as per the customs, then such gifts cannot be

construed as dowry. They are customary exchange of gifts by both

parties. In fact PW2 and PW3 also admit that the accused have also

given gold to the PW1 as per customs. Hence, this court holds that

the prosecution has failed to prove the giving or even demand of

dowry at the time of the marriage.
                                 14

                                                     C.C.No.26228/2018
     18. It is the case of the prosecution that CW1 had tried to

commit suicide due to the harassment meted out to her. Though all

the three witnesses depose that CW1 was admitted to hospital but

in this regard also there is no medical records. Only on the oral

evidence this court cannot come to conclusion that due to the

harassment meted out by the accused the PW1 tried to commit

suicide.

     19. It is the case of the prosecution that the accused always

used to harass the PW1 to get additional dowry even after marriage.

They have contended that they had given Rs.1,00,000/- once and

Rs.80,000/- on another occasion. However, to prove the same no

person is examined other than PW1 to 3 who are all close blood

relations. The prosecution has failed to examine any of the person

who had participated in the panchayath between the parties to

show that the accused used to demand additional dowry. Hence,

this aspect also cannot be considered.

     20. It is clear from the evidence that the Accused No.1 and

CW1 are residing separately due to some family disputes between

them. It is a well settled principle of law that all disputes between

husband and wife do not constitute an offence U/Sec.498-A of IPC.

In order to constitute an offence under this provision that nature of
                                  15

                                                       C.C.No.26228/2018
harassment should be in the manner defined in the provision. In

this case there is no material to show that the accused have meted

out physical and mental cruelty to the CW1. The prosecution has

failed to examine any independent witness to substantiate the

evidence of PW1 to 3 who are none other than blood relatives.

Hence, this court gives benefit of doubt to the accused and holds

that the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable

doubt.

      Accordingly, I answer Point No.1 in the Negative.

      21. POINT No.2:- For the foregoing reasons, I proceed to pass

the following:

                               ORDER
In exercise of power conferred Under Section 248(1) of Cr.P.C., accused No.1 to 5 are acquitted of the offences punishable U/s.498A of IPC. & Sec.3 & 4 of D.P.Act.

                                                    JUDGEMENT
1. This Criminal Appeal is filed, against the judgement of conviction and sentence, dated, 31.07.2017, made in SC.No.110 of 2015, by the Sessions Judge, Mahila Court, Salem, convicting and sentencing each of the Appellants/A1 to A5 for the offence under Section 498A of IPC to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for three years and to pay a fine of Rs.2,000/- each, in default to undergo Simple Imprisonment for six months and for the offence under Section 306 of IPC to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for ten years and to pay a fine of Rs.2,000/- each, in default to undergo six months http://www.judis.nic.in Rigorous Imprisonment and ordering the sentences to run concurrently.

2. The case of the Prosecution is as follows:-

a) The Appellant/A1 is the husband of the deceased, Yasodha and the Appellants/A2 and A3 are in laws of the deceased and the Appellants/A4 and A5 are the sister and brother of the Appellant/A1. The deceased and A1 fell in love with each other and due to their relationship, the deceased became pregnant and the parents of the deceased, on coming to know about the same, with the intervention of elders, had performed their marriage 2 ½ years prior to the occurrence and thereafter, the deceased was living with A1 along with A2 to A5 as a joint family.
b) After marriage, the Appellants/Accused used to often subject the deceased to cruelty by harassing and abusing her, by demanding dowry.
Due to the harassment, the deceased underwent an abortion and fell ill. Even then, the Appellants/Accused subjected the deceased to cruelty for not meeting out their demand of dowry. On 9.2.2013, A2 to A5 some time prior to 8.15 a.m. had threatened the deceased saying that if she failed to meet out their demand of dowry, they would perform the marriage of A1 with another girl and saying so, A1 had also threatened the deceased several times over phone prior to 9.2.2013. By such willful acts, the Appellants drove the deceased to commit suicide by consuming oleander seeds, which is a poisonous substance, on 9.2.2013 at about 8.15 and the deceased died on 9.2.2013 at 7.00 p.m. within seven years of her marriage in the Hospital. Hence, the Inspector of Police, Kondalampatty, Salem had laid the charge sheet against the http://www.judis.nic.in Appellants/A1 to A5 for the offences under Sections 498A, 306 and 304B of IPC

3. The case was taken on file in PRC.No.4 of 2015, by the Additional Mahila Judge, Salem and after furnishing necessary copies to the accused under Section 207 of Cr.PC, the case was committed to the Court of Sessions. The Principal District Judge, Salem had assigned SC.No.110 of 2015 and made over the case to the Sessions Judge, Mahila Court and charges were framed against the accused under Sections 498A, 306 and 304B of IPC. The substances of the charges were put forth to the accused and they were questioned. The accused had denied the charges and sought for trial. In order to bring home the charges against the accused, the prosecution examined PW.1 to PW.14 and also marked Exs.P1 to P22.

4. On completion of the evidence on the side of the prosecution, the accused were questioned under Section 313 Cr.PC as to the incriminating circumstances found in the evidence of prosecution witnesses and the accused have come with the version of total denial and stated that they have been falsely implicated in this case. On the side of the defence, Ex.D1 was marked and the Appellant/A1 was examined as DW.1. The court below, after hearing the arguments advanced on either side and also looking into the materials available on record, found the Appellants/Accused guilty and awarded punishments, as referred to above, which is challenged in this Criminal Appeal.

5. This court heard the submissions of the learned counsel on either side.

6. The learned counsel for the Appellants would submit that the Trial Court http://www.judis.nic.in erred in convicting the Appellants/Accused when though PW.1, father and PW.2 mother of the deceased have initially supported the case of the in their examination in chief, but in their cross examination, they have not supported the case of the Prosecution and that it is the clear cut case of PW.2 that the deceased committed suicide by consuming oleander seeds due to frequent stomach pain and that even at the earliest point of time, when the deceased was admitted in the Government Hospital, Salem, and examined by PW.14 Doctor, she did not implicate the accused and that till the death of the victim, the Respondent did not take any steps despite the fact that Ex.P22 accident intimation was sent by PW.14 Doctor to the Police immediately. He would further submit that the Trial Court also failed to take into consideration the delay in lodging the complaint by PW.1 and further, the Trial Court did not take into consideration the admission of PW.2 that the deceased consumed poison at her maternal house due to stomach pain.

7. The learned counsel for the Appellants/Accused would further submit that the Trial Court erred in convicting the Appellants/Accused based on Ex.P8, statement and opinion of the Revenue Divisional Officer, which was not supported by the Prosecution witnesses during the course of trial and further, the Trial Court committed a grave error in basing conviction based on 164 statements recorded from the independent witnesses, who have not been examined before the Court. He would further submit that the statement recorded under Section 164 of Cr.PC cannot be treated as a substantive evidence adduced before the Trial Court because it was not recorded in the presence of the accused and that the Prosecution has failed to prove its http://www.judis.nic.in case beyond all reasonable doubts that the Appellants abetted the victim to commit suicide and that when there is no evidence to prove that the Appellants demanded any dowry or that the deceased was subjected to cruelty on account of demand of dowry, the Trial Court erred in convicting the Appellants for the offence under Section 498A of IPC.

8. The learned counsel for the Appellants would further submit that PW.1 and PW.2 are none other than the father and mother of the victim and that PW.1 has categorically deposed that he had supported the prosecution on being tutored by the Police and that even during RDO enquiry and examination before the Magistrate, he had deposed as tutored by the Respondent Police. He would further submit that PW.2 mother of the victim was examined in chief on the same day of examination of PW.1 and she had not supported the prosecution and she had deposed that prior to the marriage, the victim and the Appellant/A1 were in love and they had sexual relationship and that she became pregnant and since they are relatives she had got the victim and the Appellant/A1 married against the wish of her husband, PW.1 and that his daughter, the deceased used to suffer stomach pain often, due to which she had delivered a still born child and that her daughter unable to bear the stomach pain, had committed suicide by consuming oleander seeds poison. He would further submit that PW.1 father was actually antagonised and angry with PW.2 since the marriage was conducted by PW.2 against his wishes and thereby he had deposed falsely, however, during the cross examination, he has also admitted that he had supported the case of the Prosecution on being tutored by the Respondent Police and that even as per http://www.judis.nic.in Ex.P7, in column 4, PW.1, mother of the deceased and sister of the deceased were said to have seen the victim alive lastly and that it is the statement of PW.2 that her daughter committed suicide by consuming poison since she was unable to bear the stomach pain

9. The learned counsel for the Appellants would further submit that the RDO enquiry has not been conducted in accordance with the procedure and that Ex.P8 is the joint statement recorded from PW.1 and PW.2, which contains finger prints of PW.1 and PW.2, based on which the joint statement was stated to have been recorded from PW.1 and PW.2, which creates a grave doubt with regard to the manner in which the RDO enquiry was conducted and further though the independent witnesses have been examined during the RDO enquiry, they were not examined before the Court and that in the absence of valid and cogent evidence in support of the Prosecution, the Trial Court erred in convicting and sentencing the Appellants on the uncorroborated evidence and the evidence of PW.1 and PW.2, who have not supported the case of the Prosecution and that the Trial Court also erred in convicting the Appellants based on 164 statements and he would seek for allowing this criminal. In support of his contentions, he would rely on the decisions reported in 2016 2 MWN Cr. 356 Division Bench (Ramasamy Vs. State) and 2013 2 LW Crl. 169 (R.Palanisamy Vs. Inspector of Police).

10.On the other hand, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the Respondent would submit that though PW.1 has rescinded from his earlier statement, he had categorically deposed about the cruelty suffered by his daughter and the demand of dowry and that the Prosecution has proved its http://www.judis.nic.in case beyond all reasonable doubts by cogent evidence and would seek for dismissal of this criminal.

11.I have given my careful and anxious consideration to the rival contentions put forward by either side and thoroughly scanned through the entire evidence available on record and also perused the impugned judgement of conviction.

12.Though the Appellants/Accused were tried for the offences under Sections 498A, 304B and 306 of IPC, the Trial Court, while acquitting the Appellants/Accused under Sections 304B of IPC, had convicted and sentenced them for the offences under Sections 498A and 306 of IPC, as stated above.

13.The main grounds of attack by the learned counsel for the Appellants are that there was a delay in registration the First Information Report and the delay in the inquest report reaching the Court and that PW.1 and PW.2, who are the father and mother of the deceased have not supported the case of the Prosecution and that the statements recorded under Section 164 of Cr.PC cannot be taken into consideration as a substantive evidence to base conviction.

14.The points that arise for consideration are as to whether the Prosecution has proved its case beyond all reasonable doubts and whether the Trial Court is justified in convicting and sentencing the Appellants/ accused for the offences under Sections 498A and 306 of IPC, as stated above, for which purpose, the oral and documentary are analysed in brief in the following paragraphs.

http://www.judis.nic.in

15.Before analysing the evidence, at this juncture, for easy reference, Section 498A of IPC is extracted as under:-

“498A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty.—Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be pun- ished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.
Explanation.—For the purpose of this section, “cruelty” means—
(a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or
(b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.”
16.It is seen from the above said provisions of Section 498 of IPC, the term “cruelty” has to be narrated as under:-

1. A women must be married
2. She must be subjected to cruelty.
3. Cruelty must be of the nature of harassment of such woman, (a) any willful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide and (b) with a view to coercing her to meet unlawful demand for property or valuable security or is on account of failure to meet such demand.
17.Further, to bring home the guilt of the Appellants/ accused for the offence under Section 306 of IPC, the Prosecution should prove that there has been clear mens rea to commit an offence and that there ought to be an active or direct act leading the deceased to commit suicide, being left with no option.

18.In the case on hand, the date of occurrence, i.e. consuming poison by the deceased, is 9.2.2013 at 8.15 hours. The deceased died on the same day at 7.00 p.m. in the hospital. PW.1, who is the father of the deceased, is the http://www.judis.nic.in defacto complainant and PW.2 is the mother of the deceased. PW.3 and PW.4, are the mahazar witnesses, PW.5 is the Doctor, who treated the deceased at the Vinayaga Mission Medical College, Salem and declared the victim as dead. PW.6 is the Doctor, who conducted postmortem on the body of the deceased. PW.7 is the Sub Inspector of Police, who received the complaint and the registered the case in Cr.No.60 of 2013. PW.8 is the Head Constable, who sent the body of the deceased for postmortem.

19.PW.9 is the Revenue Divisional Officer, who conducted inquest on the body of the deceased at the Hospital and enquired the inquest witnesses and gave his opinion and a report. PW.10 is the Deputy Superintendent of Police, who conducted the preliminary investigation. PW.11 is Additional Superintendent of Police, who conducted further investigation and filed the charge sheet.

20.PW.12 Doctor, Government Hospital, Salem had received the body of the deceased and made entry in the AR Register. PW.13 is the Doctor, who admitted the deceased in the Kribanandavariar Medical College and Hospital, Salem and treated her. PW.13 is the Doctor, attached to the Government Hospital, Salem, who prepared the accident note and made an entry in the Accident Register.

21.Ex.P1 dated 10.02.2013 is the complaint given by PW.1. Ex.P2 is the death intimation report. Ex.P3 is the postmortem certificate. Ex.P4 is the viscera report and Ex.P5 is the First Information Report, dated 10.02.2013. Ex.P6 is the requisition to conduct postmortem. Ex.P7 dated 10.02.2013 is the inquest report of the Revenue Divisional Officer, PW.9. Ex.P8 dated 25.02.2013 is the statement and opinion of PW.9, Revenue Divisional Officer. Ex.P9 and http://www.judis.nic.in Ex.P10 are the observation mahazar and rough sketch. Ex.P11 is the alteration report. Ex.P12, dated 15.04.2013 is the requisition to the Magistrate for recording 164 Cr.PC statement of the witnesses. Ex.P13 to Ex.P17 are the statements of the witnesses recorded under Section 164 of Cr.PC. Ex.P18 dated 10.02.2013 is the accident register copy and Ex.P19 dated 9.2.2013 is the accident register. Ex.P20 dated 9.2.2013 is the intimation to the Police. Ex.P21 dated 9.2.2013 is the accident register copy. Ex.P22 is the admission sheet, dated 9.2.2013.

22.DW.1 is the Appellant/A1 and Ex.D1 dated 14.3.2016 is the Government quarters allotment order copy to the accused.

23.In the chief examination, PW.1, father of the deceased had deposed about the cruelty meted out to the deceased by the Appellants, but in his cross examination, he had deposed that he had deposed in chief only on being tutored by the Police and that even at the time of preliminary enquiry, RDO enquiry and examination before the Magistrate, he had deposed as tutored by the Respondent Police to make such a statement and that the deceased and the Appellant/A1 were living happily after their marriage and his daughter frequently suffered stomach pain, due to which, she consumed oleander seeds. Thus, it is seen that PW.1, father of the deceased, though in the chief examination, has supported the case of the Prosecution, but in his cross examination had deposed totally against the Prosecution and not supported the case of the Prosecution and as such, in the opinion of this Court, the evidence of PW.1 should not have been relied on by the Trial Court to base conviction.

http://www.judis.nic.in

24.PW.1 had been examined in chief on 5.3.2016 and on the same day, PW.2 mother of the victim had been examined and she had been treated as a hostile witness and she had deposed that prior to the marriage, the victim and the Appellant/A1 were in love and had sexual relationship and that the victim became pregnant and that since they are relatives and she had got the victim and the Appellant/A1 married against the wish of her husband, PW.1. She had even in her chief examination stated that the reason for her daughter having committed suicide is due to frequent stomach pain suffered by her. Even though PW.2 had been subjected to lengthy cross examination by the Prosecution, she stood by her deposition that her daughter committed suicide due to severe stomach pain. Even as per Ex.P7, in column 4, PW.1, mother of the deceased and sister of the deceased were said to have seen the victim alive lastly. Thus, the PW.2 has also not supported the case of the Prosecution. It is also seen from the evidence of PW.3 and PW.4, mahazar witnesses that they have not supported the case of the Prosecution.

25.Further, immediately after the occurrence, the victim had been taken to the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College and Hospital, Salem and she was examined by PW.12 Doctor. At the time of admission, she was conscious and that she had not made any allegations against her husband or his relatives. Even at the time of initial admission on 9.2.2013 at 10.30 a.m. intimation had been given to the Police and thereafter she was referred to Vinayaga Mission Kirubananda Variyar Medical College and Hospital for better treatment on the same day evening at 5.00 p.m. and even from there, intimation had been given to the Respondent Police and http://www.judis.nic.in thereafter, she had not responded to the treatment and she died on the same day at 7.00 p.m and death intimation had been sent to the Respondent Police.

26.Though Ex.P2, death intimation report was sent to the Respondent Police on 9.2.2013 at 7.00 p.m., the Respondent Police had not registered the case immediately. Only on 10.02.2013 at 10.00 a.m. on receipt of the Ex.P1 complaint from PW.1, PW.7 Investigating Officer had registered the case under Section 174(iii) of Cr.PC. Further, though PW.9, Revenue Divisional Officer is stated to have sent the inquest report under Ex.P7 to the Court on 10.02.2013, it has been received in the court only on 28.03.2013. Thus, there was an inordinate delay of about 47 days in the inquest report reaching the Court, which remains unexplained by the Prosecution. Further, the first complaint based on death intimation was suppressed by the Respondent Police. There is no plausible explanation given by the Prosecution for the delay in registering the First Information Report and the inquest report reaching the Court, which is fatal to the case of the Prosecution.

27.Now coming to the conviction under Section 498A of IPC, though Section 113 A of the Indian Evidence Act, imposes the presumption as to the abetment of suicide by a married woman, in order to invoke such presumption, the prosecution has to establish by evidence that the victim was subjected to cruelty. Though a presumption could be drawn, the intial burden of showing that such an offence has been committed by the accused under Section 498 A of IPC is on the prosecution.

28. As stated above, on reading of the entire evidence, though there may seem http://www.judis.nic.in to be allegations against the Appellant/A1 for having caused cruelty on the victim, in the opinion of this Court, there is not even an iota of evidence, much less valid and cogent evidence, let in by the Prosecution to attract the ingredients of Section 498A of IPC and that the conduct of the Appellants/Accused cannot be termed as “cruelty” under Section 498A of IPC. Therefore, the conviction under Section 498 A of IPC cannot be sustained.

29.With regard to case of abetment to commit suicide, the Honourable Supreme Court in (2017) 1 SCC 433 (Gurucharan Singh Vs State of Punjab), in Paras 20 to 22 and Paras 27 to 29, has held as follows:-

“20. Section 306 of the Code prescribes the punishment for abetment of suicide and is designed thus:
“306.Abetment of suicide. – If any person commits suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.”
21. It is thus manifest that the offence punishable is one of abetment of the commission of suicide by any person, predicating existence of a live link or nexus between the two, abetment being the propelling causative factor. The basic ingredients of this provision are suicidal death and the abetment thereof. To constitute abetment, the intention and involvement of the accused to aid or instigate the commission of suicide is imperative. Any severance or absence of any of this constituents would militate against this indictment. Remoteness of the culpable acts or omissions rooted in the intention of the accused to actualize the suicide would fall short as well of the offence of abetment essential to attract the punitive mandate of Section 306 IPC.
Contiguity, continuity, culpability and complicity of the indictable acts or omission are the concomitant indices of abetment. Section 306 IPC, thus criminalises the sustained incitement for suicide.

http://www.judis.nic.in

22.Section 107 IPC defines abetment and is extracted hereunder:-

“107. Abetment of a thing. – A person abets the doing of a thing, who – First – Instigates any person to do that thing; or Secondly – Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing; or Thirdly – Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.
Explanation 1 – A person, who by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures or attempts to cause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that doing.
Explanation 2 – Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitate the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.” Not only the acts and omissions defining the offence of abetment singularly or in combination are enumerated therein, the explanations adequately encompass all conceivable facets of the culpable conduct of the offender relatable thereto.” *********
27. The pith and purport of Section 306 IPC has since been enunciated by this Court in Randhir Singh vs. State of Punjab (2004)13 SCC 129, and the relevant excerpts therefrom are set out hereunder:-
“12. Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding that person in doing of a thing. In cases of conspiracy also it would involve that mental process of entering into conspiracy for the doing of that thing. More active role which can be described as instigating or aiding the doing of a thing is required before a person can be said to be abetting the commission of offence under Section 306 IPC.
13. In State of W.B. Vs. Orilal Jaiswal (1994) 1 SCC 73, this Court has observed that the courts should be extremely http://www.judis.nic.in careful in assessing the facts and circumstances of each case and the evidence adduced in the trial for the purpose of finding whether the cruelty meted out to the victim had in fact induced her to end the life by committing suicide. If it transpires to the court that a victim committing suicide was hypersensitive to ordinary petulance, discord and differences in domestic life quite common to the society to which the victim belonged and such petulance, discord and differences were not expected to induce a similarly circumstanced individual in a given society to commit suicide, the conscience of the court should not be satisfied for basing a finding that the accused charged of abetting the offence of suicide should be found guilty.”
28. Significantly, this Court underlined by referring to its earlier pronouncement in Orilal Jaiswal (supra) that courts have to be extremely careful in assessing the facts and circumstances of each case to ascertain as to whether cruelty had been meted out to the victim and that the same had induced the person to end his/her life by committing suicide, with the caveat that if the victim committing suicide appears to be hypersensitive to ordinary petulance, discord and differences in domestic life, quite common to the society to which he or she belonged and such factors were not expected to induce a similarly circumstanced individual to resort to such step, the accused charged with abetment could not be held guilty. The above view was reiterated in Amalendu Pal @ Jhantu vs. State of West Bengal(2010) 1 SCC 707.
29. That the intention of the legislature is that in order to convict a person under Section 306 IPC, there has to be a clear mens rea to commit an offence and that there ought to be an active or direct act leading the deceased to commit suicide, being left with no option, had been propounded by this Court in S.S. Chheena vs. Vijay Kumar Mahajan (2010) 12 SCC 190.”
30.Before Section 306 of IPC can be acted upon, there must be clear proof of the fact that the death in question was a suicidal death. The offence of 'abetment' must conform to the definition of that term as given in Section 107 of IPC, that is to say, there must be instigation, cooperation or intentional assistance given to the commission of suicide. It is not necessary or indeed http://www.judis.nic.in is it a part of the definition. The suicide should have been committed in consequence of the abetment. In order to render a person liable as an abettor, it is, of course, necessary, as indeed it is in the case of any other offence, that the abettor should do something more than a mute spectator.
Thereby, without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained.

31.In this case, the essential ingredients of Section 306 of IPC for abetment have not been proved. There is no instigation to drive the deceased to commit suicide on the part of the Appellants. There is no material to show the cruelty meted out by the deceased.

32. In (2010) 1 MWN (cr.) 310 M.Sathishkumar V. State of Tamil Nadu, it was held as under:-

“6. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that even if the allegations made against the petitioner/accused are accepted to be true, even then, there is no possibility for holding the petitioner guilty of the charges either under Section 498-A or 306, I.P.C. He further submits that all the facts spoken to by the witnesses would only indicate the misunderstanding between the husband and wife and there was no love lost. Apart from that, according to the learned Senior Counsel, there is no evidence to show that the petitioner abetted the commission of offence as defined in Section 107, I.P.C. To substantiate the said contention, the learned Senior Counsel has taken me through the oral evidences and Ex.P2. He has also relied on the judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in Kishangiri Mangalgiri Goswami v. State of Gujarat, 2009 (4) MLJ (Crl) 983, wherein, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had occasion to hold as to what constitute ‘abetment of suicide’ as contemplated under Section 306, I.P.C. in terms of Section 107, I.P.C. In para 11 to 13 read as follows:-
“11Section 107, I.P.C. defines abetment of a thing. The offence of abetment is a separate and distinct offence provided in the Act as an offence. A person, abets the doing of a thing when (1) he instigates any person to do that thing; or (2) engages with one or http://www.judis.nic.in more other persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing; or (3) intentionally aids, by act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing. These things are essential to complete abetment as a crime. The word “instigate” literally means to provoke, incite, urge on or bring about by persuasion to do anything. The abetment may be by instigation, conspiracy or intentional aid, as provided in the three clauses of Section 107. Section 109 provides that if the act abetted is committed in consequence of abetment and there is no provision for the punishment of such abetment, then the offender is to be punished with the punishment provided for the original offence. ‘Abetted’ in Section 109 means the specific offence abetted. Therefore, the offence for the abetment of which a person is charged with the abetment is normally linked with the proved offence.
12. In cases of alleged abetment of suicide, there must be proof of direct or indirect acts of incitement to the commission of suicide.
The mere fact that the husband treated the deceased-wife cruelty is not enough. See Mahinder Singh v. State of M.P., 1995 AIR SCW 4570.

13. The aforesaid aspects were highlighted in Kishori Lal v. State of M.P., 2007 (10) SCC 797: 2007 (2) MLJ (Crl) 1830; Randhir Singh and another v. State of Punjab, AIR 2004 SC 5097: 2005 SCC (Cr) 56: 2004 (13) SCC 129; and Sohan Raj Sharma v. State of Haryana, Criminal Appeal No. 1464 of 2007 disposed of on 7.4.2008”.

7. A close look into the above would show that it is crystal clear that unless it is established by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt that there was either direct or indirect act of inducement to the commission of suicide, the mere fact that the husband treated the deceased wife with cruelty is not at all enough to convict, the accused under Section 306, I.P.C. In the case on hand, the witnesses, P.Ws. 1 to 3, 5, 6 have spoken only about what the deceased/D1 told them. They have only spoken that on several occasions either by phone or in person, the deceased/D1 told them that she was subjected to harassment by her husband. Except such vague statement, nothing more is found to satisfy the ingredients under Section 107, I.P.C. The learned Senior Counsel further submits that the allegations which were spoken by the witnesses do not find a place in the earlier report of the Revenue Divisional Officer. The said omission has also been established by way of contradictions and so much weightage cannot be given to the evidence of these witnesses.

8. In my opinion, the evidence of these witnesses would indicate http://www.judis.nic.in that, the deceased/D1 was harassed by the accused as there was misunderstanding between them. This will not constitute abetment as defined under Section 107, I.P.C. and therefore, the conviction under Section 306, I.P.C. cannot be sustained at all.

9. Now so far as the question of conviction under Section 498-A, I.P.C. is concerned, here, the term “Cruelty” has been explained in Section 498-A, I.P.C. as follows:

(a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or
(b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.
10. The learned Government Advocate (Criminal Side) would submit that the act of the accused would fall within the Explanation (a) to Section 498-A, I.P.C. But, I am not persuaded by the said argument. In my considered opinion, a close look into the evidences of P.Ws. 1 to 3, 5 and 6 would go to show that though the conduct of the petitioner would amount to harassment, the same would not fall within the definition of cruelty in terms of Section 498-A, I.P.C. since the conduct of the petitioner was not in the nature of likely to drive the deceased to commit suicide. As I have already stated, misunderstanding between the husband and wife and the consequent domestic quarrels cannot be termed as “Cruelty” in terms of Section 498-A, I.P.C. Therefore, the conviction under Section 498-A, I.P.C. also cannot be sustained.”

33.With regard to the enquiry conducted by the Revenue Divisional Officer, Ex.P8 is the joint statement recorded from PW.1 and PW.2, which contains finger prints of PW.1 and PW.2, based on which the joint statement was stated to have been recorded, which creates a grave doubt with regard to the manner in which the RDO enquiry was conducted. Further, though the independent witnesses have been examined during the RDO enquiry, they were not examined before the Court. In the absence of valid evidence in http://www.judis.nic.in support of the Prosecution, the Trial Court erred in convicting and sentencing the Appellants on the uncorroborated evidence and the evidence of PW.1 and PW.2, who have not supported the case of the Prosecution.

34.With regard to placing reliance on Ex.P8, statement and RDO opinion, when none of the witnesses have supported the case of the prosecution before the trial Court, the statement given before the Revenue Divisional Officer can only be taken as a statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.PC during the course of investigation and without the statements having been corroborated, the report of the Revenue Divisional Officer cannot be relied on.

35.In Gunasekaran V. State by the Inspector of Police, Perambalur Police Station reported in (2017) 1 L.W (Crl) 88, it has been held as follows :

“41. A statement given by a witness to a Revenue Divisional officer under Section 176 r/w Section 174 Cr.P.C. is also a 'previous statement'. It is not a 'Substantive piece of evidence'. Because it is not recorded before the Trial Court on oath. It is recorded 'elsewhere'. It is recorded outside the Court, namely, before the R.D.O. It is also like a statement given to a Police Officer during inquest under Section 174 Cr.P.C. The only difference is instead of a Police Officer a Revenue Official conducts the inquest and the inquiry thereon. After his enquiry, the R.D.O submits his (inquest) report.
42. In Kuldip Singh vs. State of Punjab [AIR 1992 SC 1944 = 1992 Crl.LJ 3592] the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that although the contents of the inquest report cannot be treated as evidence, it can be looked into to test the veracity of the witnesses.
43. Statement given to R.D.O. can be used by the defence to contradict the witness because it is also a previous statement. The Court cannot mark a police statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. equally, the Court cannot mark a statement given to the R.D.O. Under certain circumstances, they can be marked as defence exhibit.
44. The danger of marking, admitting statement given to a R.D.O. in evidence is that the mind of the Court will be prejudiced. And a http://www.judis.nic.in statement not given before the Court being introduced in the evidence. A statement given to police during investigation under Section 161 Cr.P.C. is not marked. Likewise, a statement given to R.D.O. also should not be marked.”
36.Further, PW.1 had rescinded from Ex.P1, the statement given to the Police, based on which, Ex.P2, First Information Report was registered. As stated above, all the witnesses including the relatives parents of the deceased and the Panchayatars, who have been examined by the Revenue Divisional Officer, have turned hostile and they have not supported the case of the Prosecution. When such being so, the report of the RDO based on the statement given by the witnesses who have turned hostile in Court, cannot be taken as substantive piece of evidence.

37.Further, the Trial Court had also placed reliance on Ex.P13 to Ex.P17, statements recorded under Section 164 of Cr.PC by the Magistrate. Now, what is to be seen is as to the use, value and objective behind such statements, what is their nature, whether it can be used against the accused and whether it can be used by the accused in his favour. In this regard, it is apposite to refer to the decision of the Division Bench of this Court reported in 2013 2 LW Crl. 169 (R.Palanisamy Vs. Inspector of Police), wherein it was held as under:-

“”2.It is relevant here to note the aspects relating to the recording of statement of witnesses contained in Section 164 Cr.P.C., they runs as under :
""164. Recording of confessions and statements. (1) Any Metropolitan Magistrate or Judicial Magistrate may, whether or not he has jurisdiction in the case, record any confession or statement made to him in the course of an investigation under this Chapter or http://www.judis.nic.in under any other law for the time being in force, or at any time afterwards before the commencement of the inquiry or trial:
Provided further x x x x x x x x (2) x x x x x (3) x x x x x (4) x x x x x (5) Any statement other than a confession made under sub-section (1) shall be recorded in such manner hereinafter provided for the recording of evidence as is, in the opinion of the Magistrate, best fitted to the circumstances of the case; and the Magistrate shall have power to administer oath to the person whose statement is so recorded.
(6) The Magistrate recording a confession or statement under this section shall forward it to the Magistrate by whom the case is to be inquired into or tried.""
66. We have carefully perused the entire oral and documentary evidence let in by the prosecution in this case. Only legally permissible evidence shall go to the record of evidence. The evidence which cannot be admitted shall not form part of the record of evidence. For instance, hearsay evidence shall not go into the record of evidence. So also the evidence of witness, which is against the prosecution version of the case, disowned statement of a witness recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C., shall not become record of evidence.

38.In AIR 1972 SC 468 (Ram Kishan Singh Vs. Harmit Kaur), it had been held that a statement under Section 164 of Cr.PC is not a substantive evidence.

39.A statement given by a witness under Section 164 of Cr.PC is like a 'previous statement' given during the investigation under Section 161 of Cr.PC. It is not a substantive evidence adduced before the Trial Judge, because it was not recorded in the presence of the accused and because , it http://www.judis.nic.in was recorded – 'res inter alios acta' – recorded behind the back of the accused and because it was recorded from a witness during the investigation.

40.In this case, when the statements under Section 164 of Cr.PC were marked, which have not been recorded before the Sessions Judge, but recorded before the Magistrate, at a time when the accused was not in picture, became part of the records, then the Trial Court should not have relied on such statements to base its conviction and there is the danger of the Trial Court using them as substantive evidence.

41.On analysis of the entire evidence and in the light of the decisions cited supra, this Court is of the firm opinion that the Prosecution has failed to prove the charges against the the Appellants beyond reasonable doubts and that none of the basis chosen by the Trial Court to convict the Appellants has the sanction of law and the Trial Court erred in convicting the Appellants placing reliance on the untested statement recorded by PW.9, Revenue Divisional Officer and exhibits and placing reliance on the statement recorded under Section 164 of Cr.PC from the witnesses, more particularly, when the other independent witnesses, from whom the statement under Section 161 of Cr.PC had been recorded, have not been examined before the Court and thus, the Prosecution has miserably failed to prove the guilt of the Appellants/accused under Sections 498A and 306 of IPC and hence, conviction and sentence under Sections 498A and 306 of IPC is not sustainable and consequently, the Appellants are entitled for acquittal.

42.In the result, this Criminal Appeal is allowed. The impugned judgement of conviction and sentence is set aside. The Appellants are acquitted of the http://www.judis.nic.in charges levelled against them. The bail bond if any executed by them shall stand cancelled and the fine amount if any paid by them shall be refunded to them.

Shri. Nagaraj Suresh Saboji vs The State Of Karnataka on 7 January, 2025
1. The registration of the FIR for offences punishable under Sections 498A, 323, 324, 504, 506 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) is challenged in this petition.

2. Respondent No. 2 lodged an FIR alleging that her marriage with accused No. 1 was solemnized 14 years ago, and from the said wedlock, three children were born. Accused No. 1 is her husband, accused Nos. 2 and 3 are her parents-in-law, and accused No. 4 is her sister-in-law. She alleged that all the accused subjected her to both physical and mental cruelty, assaulted her, abused her, and threatened her with dire consequences.

Accused No. 1 allegedly provided a separate matrimonial home where the complainant, her husband, and children resided. However, later, accused No. 1 started quarreling with her without NC: 2025:KHC-D:192 any reason, and accused Nos. 2 to 4 also subjected her to cruelty. It was further alleged that accused Nos. 2 to 4 took custody of her children. On 23.04.2022, when she went to visit her children, who were in the custody of her parents-in-law, they abused her in filthy language and assaulted her on the head.

3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners, the learned Additional Government Advocate for respondent No. 1/State, and the learned counsel for respondent No. 2/defacto complainant.

4. A perusal of the complaint indicates that the marriage between accused No. 1 and respondent No. 2 was solemnized 14 years ago, and three children were born from the said wedlock. The allegations against the accused are omnibus and general in nature. There are no specific overt acts attributed to each accused indicating how and in what manner they subjected the complainant to physical and mental cruelty or assaulted her.

5. The Apex Court in the case of Kahkashan Kausar @ Sonam & Others Vs. State of Bihar & Others1, has ruled as follows:

""19. Coming to the facts of this case, upon a perusal of the contents of the FIR dated 01.04.19, it is revealed that general allegations are levelled against the Appellants. The complainant alleged that 'all accused harassed her mentally and threatened her of terminating her pregnancy'. Furthermore, no specific and distinct allegations have been made against either of the Appellants herein, i.e., none of the (2022) 6 SCC 599 NC: 2025:KHC-D:192 Appellants have been attributed any specific role in furtherance of the general allegations made against them.
This simply leads to a situation wherein one fails to ascertain the role played by each accused in furtherance of the offence. The allegations are therefore general and omnibus and can at best be said to have been made out on account of small skirmishes. Insofar as husband is concerned, since he has not appealed against the order of the High court, we have not examined the veracity of allegations made against him. However, as far as the Appellants are concerned, the allegations made against them being general and omnibus, do not warrant prosecution.

22. Therefore, upon consideration of the relevant circumstances and in the absence of any specific role attributed to the accused appellants, it would be unjust if the Appellants are forced to go through the tribulations of a trial, i.e., general and omnibus allegations cannot manifest in a situation where the relatives of the complainant's husband are forced to undergo trial. It has been highlighted by this court in varied instances, that a criminal trial leading to an eventual acquittal also inflicts severe scars upon the accused, and such an exercise must therefore be discouraged.""

6. Therefore, continuation of investigation only on the basis of omnibus and general allegations will be an abuse of process of law. Accordingly, the petition is allowed. The impugned FIR in Crime No.35/2022, registered by Terdal Police Station, is hereby quashed.

                                                 JUDGMENT
The appellant and his mother and his brother were tried for the offences under Sections 498(A) and 304B r/w 34 of IPC in http://www.judis.nic.in1/12 S.C.No.85 of 2009 on the file of the Sessions Judge, Mahila Court, Tiruchirappalli. By Judgment dated 09.03.2011, the appellant's mother and his brother were acquitted but the appellant alone was found guilty of the offence under Sections 498(A) and 304(B) of IPC and sentenced to two years rigorous imprisonment and seven years rigorous imprisonment respectively. Challenging the same, this appeal came to be filed.


2.The prosecution case is that the appellant Ponnar got married to Mahalakshmi on 27.08.2007. The appellant treated his wife cruelly and also demanded additional dowry. Unable to bear the harassment of the appellant, Mahalakshmi committed suicide by hanging herself on 04.03.2008. In this regard, P.W.1- father of the deceased lodged Ex.P1 Complaint before the Jeeyapuram Police Station, leading to registration of FIR-Ex.P10 in Crime No.53 of 2008 for the offence under Section 304(B) of IPC. Investigation was taken up and after completion of all the usual formalities, final report came to be laid before the Judicial Magistrate No.3, Tiruchirappalli against the appellant, his mother and his brother for the offence under Sections 498A and 304B r/w 34 of IPC. Cognizance of the offence was taken and the case was committed to the Sessions Court in P.R.C.No.34 of 2008. The case was made http://www.judis.nic.in2/12 over to the Mahila Court, Tiruchirapalli for trial in S.C.No.85 of 2009. Charges were framed all the three accused. They pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The prosecution examined 17 witnesses and marked Ex.P1 to Ex.P13. M.O.1 and M.O.2 series were also marked. On the side of the accused, three witnesses were examined as D.W.1 to D.W.3. Ex.D1 and Ex.D2 were marked. After considering the evidence on record, the learned trial Judge, by the impugned Judge, acquitted the appellant's mother and brother, but convicted and sentenced the appellant as mentioned above. Questioning the same, this appeal came to be filed.

3.The learned counsel appearing for the appellant confined his arguments only to seeking acquittal in respect of the offence under Section 304(B) of IPC. He submitted that he would not challenge the finding of guilt in respect of the offence under Section 498A of IPC. But he only wanted substantial modification of the punishment imposed on him. Section 304(B) of IPC could have been invoked against the appellant only if it can be shown that soon before her death, the appellant's wife was subjected to cruelty and harassment in connection with demand for dowry. A reading of the evidence of P.W.1 would indicate that the appellant wanted his wife to bring money from her parents to tide over the serious financial http://www.judis.nic.in3/12 crisis. Even according to P.W.1, the appellant told his wife that since he is not having any income from his work, he wanted P.W.1 to bring some amount. The appellant wanted to shift to Coimbatore, where, he was hopeful of getting work. But then, he was not having any money to pay the rental advance. Therefore, he wanted a sum of Rs.5,000/- which according to P.W.1, was given to him. Whether making such demand would amount to dowry or not is no longer res integra.


4.As rightly pointed out by the learned counsel appearing for the appellant, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the decision reported in 2007 (1) MWN (Cr.) 30(SC) (Appasaheb and another Vs. State of Maharashtra), held as follows:-

“9.Two essential ingredients of Section 304-B, apart from others are:-
(i)death of woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances, and
(ii)woman is subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or in connection with any demand for “dowry” The explanation appended to sub-section (1) of Section 304-B, IPC, says that “dowry” shall have the same meaning as in Section 2 of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.
Section 2 of Dowry Prohibition Act reads as under:-

http://www.judis.nic.in4/12 “2.Definition of dowry”- In this Act “dowry” means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly-
(a) by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage; or
(b) by the parent of either party to a marriage or by any other person, to either party to the marriage or to any other person, at or before or any time after the marriage in connection with the marriage of the said parties, but does not include dower or mahr in the case of persons to whom the Muslim Personal Law(shariat) applies.
In view of the aforesaid definition of the word “dowry” any property or valuable security should be given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly at or before or any time after the marriage and in connection with the marriage of the said parties. Therefore, the giving or taking of property or valuable security must have some connection with the marriage of the parties and a correlation between the giving or taking of property or valuable security with the marriage of the parties is essential. Being a penal provision it has to be strictly construed. Dowry is a fairly well know social custom or practice in India. It is well settled principle of interpretation of Statute that if the Act is passed with reference to a particular trade, business or transaction and words are used which everybody conversant with that trade, business or transaction knows or understands to have a particular meaning in it, then the words are to be construed as having that particular meaning. (See. Union of India Vs. Garware Nylons Ltd., AIR 1996 SC 3509 and Chemicals and http://www.judis.nic.in5/12 Fibres of India Vs. Union of India, AIR 1997 SC 558). A demand for money on account of some financial stringency or for meeting some urgent domestic expenses or for purchasing manure cannot be termed as a demand for dowry as the said word is normally understood. The evidence adduced by the prosecution does not therefore, show that any demand for “dowry” as defined in Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act was made by the appellants as what was allegedly asked for was some money for meeting domestic expenses and for purchasing manure. Since an essential ingredient of Section 304-B, IPC., viz., demand for dowry is not established, the conviction of the appellants cannot be sustained.”

5.Applying the aforesaid ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, going by the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, one has to come to the conclusion that the appellant did not demand any dowry as such from his in-laws. Therefore, on the very face of it, Section 304(B) of IPC is not attracted. That apart, as rightly pointed out by the appellant's counsel, the deceased appears to have been suffering from some kind of mental depression. In the cross examination of P.W.1, a specific suggestion had been put in this regard. Of-course, the father of the deceased-P.W.1 denied the same. But then, the appellant had examined as many as three witnesses to establish his defence. D.W.1 is the Local Panchayat President. They have deposed that http://www.judis.nic.in6/12 two days prior to the occurrence, that is 02.03.2008, the deceased hit herself against the lamppost and suffered injuries on her forehead. She was taken to one Doctor-Kannan who examined the woman and also gave treatment. The said Doctor Kannan was examined as D.W.3. He had stated that the deceased Muthu Lakshmi did not give proper answers when he questioned her. D.W.2 is also another important witness. He had worked along with the appellant at Coimbatore. He had deposed that the deceased Muthu Lakshmi attempted to commit suicide at Coimbaotre and that is why, they were asked to vacate the house by the house owner and they returned to their native place thereafter. It is relevant to note here that the marriage took place on 27.08.2007. Muthu Lakshmi committed suicide on 04.03.2008. They were the residents of Somarasempettai, Trichy. They had moved to Coimbatore for better prospects. But then, they returned to their native place on 02.03.2008. This probabilises the statement made by D.W.2 in his evidence. This Court wanted to know if in the postmortem, the injuries suffered by Muthu Lakshmi on her forehead, was reflected. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant drew my attention to Ex.P8-Postmortem Certificate, in which, this injury have been specifically noted. Therefore, I am satisfied that D.W.1 and D.W.3 are speaking the truth. At this stage, it is relevant to refer to the http://www.judis.nic.in7/12 decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in (2002) 1 Supreme Court Cases 351 (Munsi Prasad and others Vs. State of Bihar). The Hon'ble Supreme Court held in the said decision as follows:-

“3.Without attributing any motive and taking the evidence on its face value, therefore, it appears that the place of occurrence was at 400-500 yards from the place of Panchayat and it is on this piece of evidence, the learned advocate for the State heavily relied upon and contended that the distance was far too short so as to be an impossibility for the accused to be at the place of occurrence- we cannot but lend concurrence to such a submission a distance of 400-500 yards cannot possibly be said to be “presence elsewhere”-it is not an impossibility to be at the place of occurrence and also at the Panchayat meet, the distance being as noticed above: the evidence on record itself negates the plea and we are thus unable to record our concurrence as regard acceptance of plea of alibi as raised in the appeal. Before drawing the curtain on this score, however, we wish to clarify that the evidence tendered by the defence witnesses cannot always be termed to be a tainted one by reason of the factum of the witnesses being examined by the defence. The defence witnesses are entitled to equal respect and treatment as that of the prosecution. The issue of credibility and trustworthiness ought to be attributed to the defence witnesses on a par with that of the prosecution-a lapse on the part of the defence witnesses cannot be differentiated http://www.judis.nic.in8/12 and be treated differently than that of the prosecution witnesses.”
6.Merely because, D.W.1 to D.W.3 were examined on the side of the defence, their testimonies cannot be put on a lower pedestal. As held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, their testimonies are entitled to equal respect as that of the prosecution witness.
Thus, the appellant is entitled to be acquitted on both the grounds.

1.Section 304B of IPC is not attracted to this case.

2.The death of Muthu Lakshmi appears to be more due to her mental depression rather than due to harassment in connection with dowry demand.


7.Of-course, the decision cited by the learned counsel appearing for the appellant reported in 2007 (1) MWN (Cr.) 30(SC) (Appasaheb and another Vs. State of Maharashtra), will not come to the appellant's rescue, while considering the validity of his conviction under Section 498A of IPC. Section 498A of IPC states that if the women had been subjected to cruelty, it is an offence. The expression cruelty has been defined in the explanation to Section 498A of IPC as false. The expression dowry is not mentioned in Clause (b) of the explanation. Therefore, http://www.judis.nic.in9/12 technical or the narrow meaning that is formally attached to the expression “dowry” cannot be imported into Section 498A of IPC. The decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court rendered in 2007 (1) MWN (Cr.) 30(SC) (Appasaheb and another Vs. State of Maharashtra), cannot come to the appellant's rescue at all. In this case, the prosecution had established beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had harassed his wife Muthu Lakshmi to bring money from her parents. It is certainly an unlawful demand. It may not amount to dowry within the technical meaning of the term. But then, demanding money from the in-law is certainly an act of cruelty falling within the purview of Section 498 A of IPC.

8.Having regard to the evidence on record and the statutory definition, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant submitted that he would not challenge the finding of guilt in respect of the offence under Section 498A of IPC. He only wanted leniency in the matter of punishment.


9.The occurrence had taken place way back in the year 2008. We are now in the year 2019. The appellants appears to have re-married a few years back. Two children have been born to the appellant through his second marriage. If the appellant is http://www.judis.nic.in10/12 sentenced to undergo a long term of imprisonment, certainly, it will have a ruinous impact on his new family. Therefore, taking into account all these mitigating aspects and also the fact that the appellant demanded only to meet out his dire financial necessity, the interest of justice will be served by reducing the sentence of imprisonment from two years rigorous imprisonment to six months rigorous imprisonment. It appears that the appellant had already been in prison for about 65 days. The period of incarceration already undergone by the appellant will be set off in terms of Section 428 of Cr.P.C. The conviction and sentence imposed on the appellant under Section 304(B) of IPC is set aside. The conviction imposed on the appellant under Section 498(A) of IPC is confirmed. The sentence is reduced to six months rigorous imprisonment.

10.With this modification, this criminal appeal is partly allowed.

Banavat Bharathi Bai vs State Andhra Pradesh,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/175757950/,"Andhra Pradesh High Court - Amravati
Banavat Bharathi Bai vs State Andhra Pradesh on 7 January, 2025
The instant petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short, ""Cr.P.C."") has been filed by the Petitioners/ Accused Nos.2 to 9, seeking quashment of the proceedings against them in C.C No. 1640 of 2021 on the file of the Special Judicial Magistrate of First Class for Excise, Guntur, Guntur District.


Dr.VJPJ,

2. Heard Sri M.V.Raja Ram, learned counsel for the petitioners, Sri C.Narendra Babu, learned counsel for the respondent No.2 and Ms. K. Priyanka Lakshmi, learned Assistant Public Prosecutor on behalf of the State.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioners would submit that the petitioners herein are A2 to A9. A2 and A3 are mother and father of A1. A4 is Brother's wife of A1. A5 and A6 are sister of A1 and her husband respectively. A7 to A9 are mother, father and brother of A4 respectively. Learned counsel would submit that A7 to A9 are not family members of A1. They are parents and brother of A4. The petitioners have nothing to do with the case. Accused No.1 is the husband of respondent No.2. He has filed a petition for restitution of conjugal rights. A1 also filed a petition under Guardians and Wards Act seeking custody of the child. A5 and A9 are pursuing their studies. A6 is the husband of the sister of A1, who is working at State Bank of India, Khammam. Learned counsel would submit that without any preliminary enquiry, the case has been lodged against all the family members of the husband as an armtwist to settle their scores. Learned counsel would submit that report which was presented to the Police by the complainant does not contain any allegations against the petitioners to attract the offences under Sections 498A of IPC or Section 3 & 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act. Learned counsel would further submit that the petitioners have never visited the place of the respondent No.2 and stayed under one roof along with the respondent No.2 and A1. The allegations made against the petitioners are vague and omnibus Dr.VJPJ, in nature. Learned counsel finally submits that the Police did not make proper investigation and simply filed charge sheet against all the petitioners. Learned Magistrate has taken cognizance in a casual way without application of Judicial mind. Learned counsel finally submits that continuing criminal proceedings against the petitioners is mere abuse of process of law.

4. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent No.2 would submit that there are specific allegations made against the petitioners/A2, A3 and A4. Learned counsel would further submit that complaint would show that A1 developed objectionable relation with A4 who is his brother's wife due to which the disputes arose between the couple. Learned counsel would further submit that when the complainant questioned the illegal acts of the husband, the parents and brother of A4 also intervened and respondent No.2 and her parents were beaten by them. Learned counsel would further submit that learned Magistrate has taken cognizance for the offences under Section 498A and Sections 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act against all the petitioners and it is not a fit case for quashment.


5. Learned Assistant Public Prosecutor supported the version of the respondent No.2 and would submit that the Court may pass appropriate orders.

Determination by the Court

6. A bare perusal of Section 482 makes it clear that the Code envisages that inherent powers of the High Court are not limited or affected so as to Dr.VJPJ, make orders as may be necessary; (i) to give effect to any order under the Code or, (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or, otherwise (iii) to secure ends of justice. A court while sitting in Section 482 jurisdiction is not functioning as a court of appeal or a court of revision. It must exercise its powers to do real and substantial justice, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case. These powers must be invoked for compelling reasons of abuse of process of law or glaring injustice, which are against sound principles of criminal jurisprudence.

7. In the context of quashment of criminal proceedings arising out of matrimonial matters, the Hon'ble Apex Court in Kahkashan Kausar @ Sonam v. State of Bihar1, held as follows:

""18. The above-mentioned decisions clearly demonstrate that this court has at numerous instances expressed concern over the misuse of section 498A IPC and the increased tendency of implicating relatives of the husband in matrimonial disputes, without analysing the long term ramifications of a trial on the complainant as well as the accused. It is further manifest from the said judgments that false implication by way of general omnibus allegations made in the course of matrimonial dispute, if left unchecked would result in misuse of the process of law. Therefore, this court by way of its judgments has warned the courts from proceeding against the relatives and in-laws of the husband when no prima facie case is made out against them.
***** 2022 LiveLaw (SC) 141 Dr.VJPJ,
22.Therefore, upon consideration of the relevant circumstances and in the absence of any specific role attributed to the accused appellants, it would be unjust if the Appellants are forced to go through the tribulations of a trial, i.e., general and omnibus allegations cannot manifest in a situation where the relatives of the complainant's husband are forced to undergo trial. It has been highlighted by this court in varied instance that a criminal trial leading to an eventual acquittal also inflicts severe scars upon the accused, and such an exercise must therefore be discouraged.""
(emphasis supplied)

8. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Achin Gupta v. State of Haryana and another2, highlighted the requirement of taking the realities into consideration and legislating, especially in the context of the Sections 85 and 86 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023. The relevant observations made in the context of the present case highlighting the duty of this Court, in the said judgment is as follows;


""25. If a person is made to face a criminal trial on some general and sweeping allegations without bringing on record any specific instances of criminal conduct, it is nothing but abuse of the process of the court. The court owes a duty to subject the allegations levelled in the complaint to a thorough scrutiny to find out, prima facie, whether there is any grain of truth in the allegations or whether they are made only with the sole object of involving certain individuals in a criminal 2024 INSC 369 Dr.VJPJ, charge, more particularly when a prosecution arises from a matrimonial dispute.""
(emphasis supplied)

9. In Payal Sharma v. State of Punjaband Another 3 , the Hon'ble Supreme Courtheld as follows::


""The decisions referred above on the subject of exercise of power under Section 482, Cr.P.C., would undoubtedly cast a duty on the Courts to consider the contentions that there is lack of specific allegations against the accused concerned to constitute the offence(s) alleged against a relative or that the implication was nothing but an over implication to pressurise the family of the husband to yield to the demands. The Courts cannot refrain from discharging the obligation to consider such contentions.""
(emphasis supplied)

10. Keeping in mind the guiding principles as envisaged in the Judgments rendered by Hon'ble Supreme Court, the factual matrix of the present case has to be scrutinized with great care and caution since the petitioners approached this Court seeking quashment of the case against them. As rightly put by the learned counsel for the respondent No.2, there are allegations against A1, A2 and A3 to the effect that they have harassed the respondent No.2 for the sake of additional dowry. There are allegations made against A4 to the effect that at her instance, A1 used to harass respondent No.2 and A4 2024 INSC 896 Dr.VJPJ, has some objectionable relation with A1 due to which the relation between A1 and respondent No.2 strained.


11. Coming to the case of A5 and A6, A5 is the married sister of A1 and A6 is her husband. As rightly put by the learned counsel for the petitioners, except making omnibus allegations against them, nothing in specific is attributed against them to maintain criminal case for the offence punishable under Section 498A of IPC and Section 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act.

12. Coming to the case of A7 to A9, except making a casual reference in the complaint that when respondent No.2 questioned the illegal act of her husband maintaining relation with A4, her parents and brother beat her. This allegation made against A7 to A9 is bereft of any other details in the complaint. Needless to say that this is not the information given to the Police by the complainant i.e., the respondent No.2 immediately after the alleged incident. As can be seen from the record, the specific date on which the alleged incident said to have been taken place is also not present in the complaint. As rightly put by the learned counsel for the petitioners, A7 to A9 are not the relatives of the husband but they are relatives of the brother's wife of A1. In that view, on conglomeration of facts and circumstances under which, this case has been emanated, this Court is of the view that continuing criminal proceedings against A5 to A9 is sheer abuse of process of law.

13. In that view, this petition is partly allowed. The case against the petitioners/A5 to A9in C.C No. 1640 of 2021 on the file of the Special Judicial Dr.VJPJ, Magistrate of First Class for Excise, Guntur, Guntur District is hereby quashed. However, the petition with regard to the petitioners/A2 to A4is dismissed and the proceedings against them shall continue.

As a sequel thereto, miscellaneous petitions pending, if any, shall stand closed.

"State By Public Prosecutor, Madras vs Mittalal Nahar, Prakash Bai And Gowtham",https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1002197/,"Madras High Court
State By Public Prosecutor, Madras vs Mittalal Nahar, Prakash Bai And Gowtham ... on 4 February, 2002
1. The State through the Public Prosecutor on behalf of the Inspector of Police, C.B., C.I.D., Chengleput Division, has filed this appeal challenging the judgment of acquittal in favour of the respondents 1 to 3 (A1 to A3) in respect of the charges framed for the offences under Sections 120B, 304B, 306 and 498A I.P.C. against all the three accused, under Sections 203 and 417 I.P.C. against the first accused and under Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act against the accused 1 and 2.

3. During the course of trial, P.W.1 to P.W.26 were examined, Exs.P1 to P17 were marked. On the side of the defence, Exs.D1 to D3 were marked. Ultimately, the case ended in acquittal. Challenging the same, the State has filed this appeal. Besides this, P.W.1 also has separately filed a revision before this Court.

4. While challenging the said judgment, Mr. S. Jayakumar, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor, appearing for the State would contend that the trial Court has overlooked the material evidence available on record as well as ignored the basic principles in regard to appreciation of evidence and thereby acquitted the accused by giving importance to the insignificant aspects and consequently, the case ended in acquittal, which caused grave miscarriage of justice.

5. This contention is supported by the counsel for the petitioner in the revision against acquittal.

6. Mr. A. Natarajan, the learned counsel appearing for the respondents/accused would elaborately submit that the reasons for the acquittal are justified and the materials would not be sufficient to hold the respondents guilty of the charges and as such, this is not a case for interference, especially in view of the scope of the appellate powers in the matter dealing against the judgment of acquittal.

7. I have carefully considered the rival contentions.

11. In the light of the above principles, we have to see the reasonings given by the trial Court for acquitting the accused in order to find out whether they are correct or not.

13. Let us now come to the reasonings given by the trial Court for acquitting the respondents.

(1) Admittedly, the death was taken place on 21.3.1987. But, the complaint was given only on 28.3.1987. This delay has not been properly explained by the prosecution.
(2) In Ex.P2 complaint, there is no reference about the dowry demand or torture.
(3) Usually, the delivery of the child would be at the parents' house only. There is no explanation as to why the child was delivered at the husband's place.
(4) In Ex.P2, the complaint given by P.W.1, it is stated that A3 demanded the amount of Rs.50,000/-. But, P.W.8 would state that all the three demanded the amount. On the other hand, P.W.4 would state that A1 and A2 demanded the amount in the presence of A3. This is a vital contradiction.
(5) The marriage was finalised and fixed by one Lal. There is no reason as to why the said Lal was not examined.
(6) P.W.1 would admit that the accused gave a copy of the list of Sridhana articles containing the endorsement by the accused having received the same. That list was not produced.
(7) According to P.W.8, she saw injuries on the neck. But, the same was not informed to P.W.1's husband.
(8) P.Ws.10, 13 and 14 though would state that they went to upstairs and saw the dead body of the deceased found hanging from the fan, they did not give the statement to the police immediately and they gave the statement only after six months.
(9) Ex.P6 certificate issued by P.W.9 Doctor would show that the deceased died only due to heart attack. There is no post-mortem certificate giving the reason for death.
(10) The letter Ex.P1 and Exs.D1 and D2 written by the deceased did not contain the reference about the torture at the hands of the accused.
15. Let us now first go into each one of the reasonings given by the trial Court for acquittal.

26. Thus, all the reasons, in my view, are not valid reasons and under those circumstances, the finding given by the trial Court for acquitting the accused is perverse causing flagrant miscarriage of justice.

30. After finishing functions, the deceased and A3 were sent back to Kanchipuram. On 26.3.1986, i.e. three months later, the deceased for the first time phoned to P.W.1 and told that she was ill-treated by the accused persons in their house and that A1 sold her Ottiyanam weighing about 150 grams. Later, she also wrote a letter Ex.P1 stating that P.W.1 should not write any letter regarding the Ottiyanam, which was sold. After some months, the deceased and her husband (A3) came to attend a marriage. On the way to Kanchipuram, they came and visited P.W.1's house. At that time, the deceased complained to P.W.1 that the accused persons did not like the pattern of the bangles and they should be re-modelled. Accordingly, the bangles were given to Goldsmith P.W.3 and after re-modelling, they were given back to the deceased. At that time itself, she told P.W.1, P.W.4 and P.W.8 that she was treated badly by the accused persons.

39. In the light of the said situation, the efforts were taken by P.W.1's family by sending complaints after complaints to the Officers concerned and ultimately, they obtained orders from this Court for investigation by the C.B., C.I.D.

41. However, it shall be stated that the charge under Section 304B I.P.C. and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act may not be made out, in view of the fact that the materials in respect of the demand of dowry is absent. Even according to prosecution, A1 earlier demanded Rs.10,000/-, since the rent charges were not given for the stay of his relatives at Hassan at the time of marriage. Secondly, the deceased was not allowed to go to Hassan for delivery. Delivery of the child was arranged by the accused family at Kanchipuram. Towards the expenses of the delivery of the child, they demanded Rs.50,000/-. Since Rs.50,000/- was not paid, the accused ill-treated the deceased which resulted in the commission of suicide. Under those circumstances, it cannot be said that this is a case of dowry death. But, on the other hand, there are materials to show that there is a cruelty, which resulted in the suicide, which would attract Sections 306 and 498A I.P.C.

63. The learned counsel on the strength of the decisions in SHARAD v. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA , STATE OF U.P. v. MAHESH CHANDRA PANDEY (A.I.R.2000 S.C.3631(2), STATE OF MAHARASHTRA v. ASHOK NARAYAN DANDALWAR (A.I.R.2000 S.C.3568(2) ), CHANCHAL KUMARI v. UNION TERRITORY, CHANDIGARH and INDERPAL v. STATE OF M.P. (I (2001) CCR 247 (SC), would submit that the evidence let in by the prosecution, would not make out the offences alleged.

70. Accordingly, the appeal as against the acquittal in respect of A1 and A3 is allowed and A1 and A3 are convicted for the offences under Sections 306 and 498A I.P.C. The appeal as against A2 is dismissed.

71. In view of the disposal of the appeal, no separate order is necessary in the revision filed by P.W.1.

2. After pronouncement of judgment of conviction, this Court adjourned the matter to enable the accused convicted for pleading on question of sentence. But unfortunately, on the adjourned date, the accused through their counsel newly engaged, would venture to question the judgment of conviction itself.

4. Accordingly, on 18.2.2002, A1 and A3 were present. It was informed before this Court that Mr. A. Natarajan, the learned counsel who argued the matter earlier on behalf of the accused, gave a change of vakalat on the instruction of A1 and A3 for Mr.Karuppan, the learned counsel who has entered appearance on their behalf.

5. Mr.Karuppan, who appeared before this Court on behalf of A1 and A3, the convicted accused, requested two days' time to file their statement with regard to the question of sentence. Accordingly, the matter was directed to be posted on 21.2.2002 and A1 and A3 were directed to be present on that day.

6. Strangely, on 21.2.2002, instead of filing the statement with reference to the question of sentence, Mr.Karuppan, who has entered appearance on behalf of the accused, filed an affidavit sworn to by the accused and requested this Court to re-hear the case by adjourning the case by a month with a direction to furnish a copy of the judgment on the ground that the judgment of conviction was pronounced with a delay of 5 months even though the judgment was reserved on 29.8.2001.

7. He would further submit that the accused would also file an affidavit requesting to show leniency in the sentence without prejudice to his submissions in support of the plea for re-hearing the case. Accordingly, the accused were permitted to file affidavit giving the statement in regard to the question of sentence. The matter was directed to be posted on 22.2.2002.

10. Elaborating the various contentions contained in the affidavit filed by the party dated 27.2.2002, Mr.Karuppan would strenuously submit that this Court has not considered various infirmities in the prosecution case and Mr. A. Natarajan, erstwhile counsel has failed to bring to the notice of this Court those infirmities and consequently, this Court fell into error by rendering a judgment of conviction after setting aside the order of acquittal and in any event, the judgment was pronounced after a delay of 5 months and as such, the appeal which was allowed earlier has to be dismissed by this Court by reviewing its own judgment.

22. The above guideline would show that the parties are entitled to move before the Chief Justice requesting to withdraw their case from particular Bench and to make over to any other Bench after a period of six months. This shows that the maximum limit which is mentioned in the guideline is six months.

25. Let us now come to the criticism made on the erstwhile counsel Mr. A. Natarajan by Mr.Karuppan, the present counsel. At the outset, it has to be emphatically stated that it is quite improper on the part of Mr.Karuppan to have made such a criticism against the erstwhile counsel who is an experienced lawyer.

27. In fact, only because of Mr. A. Natarajan's persuasive arguments and effective submissions, this Court was able to confirm the acquittal of all the accused in respect of the offences under Sections 304B and Sections 4 and 5 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. Only on the basis of the submissions and various judgments rendered by this Court as well as the Supreme Court cited by him which have been referred and quoted in this judgment, A2 has been acquitted in respect of the offences under Sections 306 and 498A I.P.C. holding that there is no material to show that there was a dowry demand. But, as pointed out by this Court in various paragraphs of the judgment, there are materials to show that the respondents and 3 (A1 and A3) had committed the offences under Sections 306 and 498A I.P.C.

29. Mr.Karuppan, the learned counsel for the accused would venture to argue on merits stating that this is not a case for conviction. Strangely, he makes a submission that the Hindi version of the letters Exs.D1 and D2 has not been given to the accused.

32. By these arguments, Mr.Karuppan, the learned counsel appearing for the respondents 1 and 3 requests this Court to set aside my judgment convicting A1 and A3 and to dismiss the appeal. Virtually, he requests for recalling and review of my judgment. He would cite the decision in LAL SINGH v. STATE (DB) in support of his plea.

36. The observation in is this:

""The Code of Criminal Procedure does not authorise the High Court to review its judgment or order passed either in exercise of its appellate, revisional or original jurisdiction. Section 362 of the Code prohibits the court after it has signed its judgment or final order disposing of a case from altering or reviewing the said judgment or order except to correct a clerical or arithmetical error. This prohibition is complete and no criminal court can review its own judgment or order after it is signed.""
39. The first disturbing feature is that Mr.Karuppan, instead of arguing the case, made a comment on the erstwhile counsel stating that he did not perform his duty well which resulted in the conviction of the accused.

40. Mr.Karuppan who has got sufficient experience in standing should not have indulged in such an attack against his own colleague.

42. In other words, an advocate who has been newly engaged should concentrate on the work entrusted to him and he should not discover a lacuna in almost everything that has gone before. If he tries to find out some lacuna on the part of the erstwhile counsel in performance of his duty and builds up his arguments on that basis, the same cannot be considered to be ethical.

43. Even if there is some lacuna on the part of the erstwhile counsel, the new counsel should not decry his own colleague in order to get some orders in favour of his clients.

45. The second disturbing feature is that Mr.Karuppan ventured to request this Court to set aside its own judgment of conviction without knowing the existence of the present law.

46. As noted above, he asked for adjournment on the first day only in order to file statement with regard to question of sentence. But on the adjourned date, to the shock and surprise of this Court, he filed a petition along with an affidavit requesting this Court to re-hear the matter on the ground that my judgment is wrong.

47. This submission is purely against law as per the existing provision contained in Section 362 of the amended Code. The Supreme Court also, as referred to above, would specifically state that the judgment cannot be reviewed, recalled and re-heard.

49. It is submitted by the counsel for the accused Mr.Karuppan that only for the sake of his clients and only on their advice he sought to argue the matter on merits.

56. Let us now come to the plea of the accused for showing leniency in the matter of imposition of sentence as contained in the affidavit filed on behalf of the accused.

58. On these reasonings, it is contended that this Court can pass an award giving the minimum sentence taking a lenient view of the matter by levying a fine.

60. While considering the various facts situation mentioned in the affidavit requesting for leniency in the sentence, this Court is conscious of the fact that the trial Court acquitted the accused in 1991 and this Court set aside the acquittal and convicted A1 and A3 in 2002.

61. As far as the third accused is concerned, though he can be sentenced to imprisonment for the offences referred to above, I am not inclined to send him to jail in view of the special feature that the girl of 15 years born through the victim and the second wife along with three children are living him. Under those circumstances, it would be appropriate to impose some other punishment rather than imprisonment upon A3.

62. There is no limit with regard to the quantum of fine amount for this Court. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, I am of the view that the third accused can be directed to pay compensation of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh) to P.W.1's family instead of undergoing imprisonment by invoking Section 357(3) Cr.P.C. and accordingly directed.

63. It is submitted that P.W.1 recently died. Therefore, P.W.1's legal representatives are entitled to the said compensation. The said compensation of Rs.one lakh shall be deposited by A3 in the trial Court within eight weeks from today. In default, he has to undergo R.I. for two years. The trial Court is directed to allow P.W.1's legal representatives to withdraw the said amount.

64. In so far as A1 is concerned, though it is stated that he is aged 58 years and having disease and all, I am of the opinion that he is liable to be punished with some imprisonment. Though 10 years is the maximum limit for the offence under Section 306 I.P.C. and 3 years for the offence under Section 498A I.P.C., taking into consideration the age and other things, it would be appropriate to impose upon him R.I. for two years on each count and both the sentences are directed to run concurrently and he is also liable to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/- each, totally Rs.2,000/-, in default to undergo R.I. for six months.

65. With the above observations, the matter is disposed of.

2. When the matter is taken up at 2.15 P.M., Mr.Karuppan has filed the affidavit sworn to by the first accused Mittalal requesting this Court to grant four weeks time to surrender before the Court to undergo the period of sentence of two years.

3. In view of the reason mentioned in the affidavit and in view of the request made by Mr.Karuppan, it would be appropriate to give four weeks time to the first accused to surrender. Accordingly, the first respondent/first accused is permitted to surrender before the trial Court on or before 15.4.2002. On his surrender, the trial Court is directed to remand him to custody to undergo the period of sentence imposed by this Court. In the event of non-surrender by the first accused, the trial Court is directed to issue non-bailable warrant to secure the custody of the first accused/first respondent to undergo the period of sentence."

Thereafter, a written complaint was made wherein allegations have been made against the in laws of the deceased. In the complaint, it has been alleged that the deceased, Smt. Rima Kumari, was being pressurised for dowry by her husband, her in laws, as well as the girl friend of her husband, which led to her committing suicide. Allegations of domestic violence have also been made against the husband. She has left behind one daughter who is now in the custody of parents of the deceased.

2.2. Specifically, the incident dated 11th April, 2024, is highlighted where the husband of the deceased beat her up when he came to know that the deceased had made call to his girlfriend. The Suicide note, written on the date of her suicide, specifically mentioned the name of Ajay Kumar Manjhi (husband), Ramita Devi (Mother-in-law), Dhaneshwar Kumar Manjhi (Father-in-law), Sanjay Kumar Manjhi (brother-in-law), Poonam (wife of Sanjay Manjhi), Shardha Kumari (sister-in-law) and Naveen Bharti (alleged girlfriend of Ajay Manjhi). The Applicant i.e., Poonam Devi, wife of the brother-in-law of the deceased, has thus been specifically named in the suicide note.

3. In view of the above and the serious nature of allegations made, the APP strongly opposes the Applicant's request for grant of bail.

4. The Court has considered the aforenoted contentions. On 25 th November, 2024, the Court while granting interim protection to the Applicant had directed her to join the investigation as and when directed by the IO. Since then, the Applicant has appeared before the IO on 10th December, 2024. Furthermore, the Applicant undertakes to continuously appear before the IO as and when directed.

5. It is also pointed out that the husband of the deceased and his alleged girlfriend are presently in judicial custody. The chargesheet has been filed against the husband, his alleged girlfriend, as well as his parents. The names of parents are mentioned in column No. 12 of the chargesheet. As far as the Applicant is concerned, who is the sister-in-law (Jethani of the deceased), it has been pointed out that she along with her husband, Sanjay Kumar, have been living separately for last ten years. The marriage between the deceased and her husband took place on 28th November, 2013. Furthermore, in the suicide note, there is no specific allegation against the Applicant except for her name.

6. It is not in doubt that an order for grant of Anticipatory bail cannot be passed in a routine manner. At the same time, it cannot be denied that great amount of humiliation and disgrace is attached with the arrest. In cases where the accused has joined investigation and is cooperating with the Investigating Agency and is not likely to abscond, custodial interrogation should be avoided.

7. In light of the foregoing, the application is allowed. Consequently, the Applicant, in the event of arrest, is directed to be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs. 25, 000/- with one surety of the like amount subject to the satisfaction of the arresting officer/IO/SHO concerned, on the following conditions:

a. The Applicant shall join and cooperate with the investigation as and when directed by the IO;
b. The Applicant shall not leave the country without informing the IO/ SHO concerned;
c. The Applicant shall not influence any witness/complainant/victim or This is a digitally signed order.

2. The brief facts of the prosecution case is that on 29.01.2013 the second respondent/defacto complainant preferred a complaint before the first respondent/police stating that she got married to the first petitioner on 29.08.2012 at Chennai and the marriage was conducted in a very grand manner by spending Rs.30lakhs and her parents had given 75 Soverigns of gold jewels, 3kgs of Silver articles and other house hold articles as Sreedhanam, in addition to that they have also gifted 16 Soverigns of Gold jewels to A1/first petitioner. After marriage, the first petitioner/A1 had left to Australia for his job on 15.09.2012 and later the defacto complainant/second respondent mortgaged her jewels for Rs.3lakhs to get VISA and after obtaining VISA the complainant went to Australia on 18.10.2012 by taking 25 Sovereigns of Gold jewels with her. The further averment is that the first petitioner/A1 tortured her by demanding Rs.5lakhs and A1 also consumed alcohol and harassed her. Further, the first accused had informed that his father/2nd petitioner wanted to start a business and that an amount of Rs.5lakh is required and had asked the second respondent/defacto complainant to get money from her father. He had further told her to handover all the jewels to his parents and the parents of the first petitioner also harassed her. The second respondent/defacto complainant had further http://www.judis.nic.in stated that the first petitioner/A1 had harassed her only based on the instigation of his parents/the 2nd and 3rd petitioners at Chennai, thereby the defacto complainant suffered mentally and physically, further she was sent back to Chennai from Australia to her parents house on 16.01.2013. Further, when the defacto complainant along with her parents had gone to the house of the petitioners 2 and 3 at Mogappair, they had prevented her to enter the house stating if only she pays Rs.5lakhs and bring the remaining jewels they would allow her to live with her son and that the 1 st petitioner was acting as per the instructions of his parents and that his parents were responsible for the split and that they were taking steps to leave to Australia and arrange for second marriage for A1. Based on the complaint an enquiry was conducted in CSR/25/W8/AW8PS/2013 and thereafter a case was registered in Cr.No.4 of 2013 under Section 498A, 406 IPC and Section 4 of TamilNadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act 2005 and Section 4 and 6 of Dowry Prohibition Act. The first respondent sent the complaint to the Dowry Prohibition Officer and thereafter during the course of investigation examined five witnesses and filed final report against the accused for the offences under Section 498A and 406 IPC r/w.4 of TamilNadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act 2005 and Section 4 and 6 of Dowry Prohibition Act. The http://www.judis.nic.in case was taken up in CC.No.470 of 2014 on the file of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Egmore, Chennai. This petition has been filed to quash CC.No.470 of 2014.

3. The learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the marriage between the first petitioner and the defacto complainant was solemenised on 29.08.2012 at Chennai as per Hindu Rites and customs. At the time of marriage the petitioner was employed at Australia and immediately after the marriage, the first petitioner had taken the defacto complainant to Australia on Tourist Visa and thereafter the first petitioner had also applied for spouse Visa when she was in Australia. While they were in Australia some misunderstanding arose between the first petitioner and the defacto complainant. The defacto complainant returned back to Chennai and filed a false complaint against the petitioners. A case of misunderstanding had been exaggerated and a false complaint has been given for offences under Section 498A and 406 IPC and under Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act 2005 and Section 4 and 6 of Dowry Prohibition Act. Taking into consideration the materials on record, no case for offences under the provisions alleged are made out against the accused. Even as per the statements recorded from the witnesses, no case can be made out against the petitioners for http://www.judis.nic.in offences under Section 498A IPC and under Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act 2005 and Section 4 and 6 of Dowry Prohibition Act. There is absolutely no averment or allegation of subjecting the defacto complainant to cruelty within the meaning of Section 498A IPC. Further, it is the admitted case of the prosecution that the entire articles and the amounts were with the custody of the defacto complainant and her parents and thereby there was no case of entrustment of any property and offence under Section 406 IPC cannot be made out.

4. The learned counsel for the respondent would further submit that the marriage was solemnised on 29.08.2012 and the complaint was made on 29.01.2013 within five months of marriage. Though the complaint was initially registered in CSR/25/W8/AWPS/2013, the respondent without referring the complaint to the District Social Welfare Officer/Dowry Prohibition Officer, on the instance of the father of the defacto complainant who was a Deputy Collector in the State Government and an influential person immediately got the case registered for the offence under Section 498A and 406 IPC and under Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act 2005 and Section 4 and 6 of Dowry Prohibition Act. After registration of the http://www.judis.nic.in case, the complaint was referred to the District Social Welfare Officer/Dowry Prohibition Officer for enquiry and she had after due enquiry concluded that there was no demand of dowry. Since, the report of the District Social Welfare Officer/Dowry Prohibition Officer was against the case of the prosecution, the 1st respondent without adding her as a witnesses and without annexing the report has filed the final report. In the meantime, the petitioners were harassed by various complaints given by the defacto complainant to different authorities. Complaints were preferred by the defacto complainant against the petitioners before the Tamil Nadu State Women's Commission, Chennai and before the Judicial Magistrate, Alandur under the Domestic Violence Act in CMP.No.5993 of 2013. Later the 1st petitioner filed a petition for divorce in OP.No.3587 of 2013 before the Principal Family Court, Chennai on the ground of cruelty and it was decreed on 17.06.2015. Subsequently, after the divorce the defacto complainant did not proceed further and she got married to one Arun Govindan on 20.01.2016 at Chennai and she had migrated to Australia. Subsequently, the marriage between the defacto complainant and the said Arun Govindan has also been dissolved by the Federal Circuit Court of Australia vide Divorce order in File No:(P)MLC9333/2017 dated 19.12.2017. Meanwhile the proceedings against the petitioners filed by the http://www.judis.nic.in defacto complainant under the Domestic Violence Act before the Judicial Magistrate, Alandur in CMP.No.5993 of 2013 was dismissed for non prosecution on 18.09.2015.


5. The learned counsel would further submit that thereafter the 1st petitioner got married to one Vamsaroopa Surapareddy on 22.11.2015 at Chennai and is now settled at Australia and a girl child was born to them on 03.01.2018 and the child is now three years old. The 1st petitioner also reliably understands that the defacto complainant after her second divorce is also married again and settled in Australia. The learned counsel would further submit that a malicious complaint of demand of dowry and harassment has been filed under the heat of the moment over the issues without proper deliberations only with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance to spite the petitioner due to private and personal grudge. The trial Court had taken the same on file.


6. The learned counsel for the petitioner would further submit that much water has flown down the bridge and now the 1st petitioner and the defacto complainant have started separate lives on their own and the defacto complainant had not proceeded http://www.judis.nic.in further with the complaint and she has also not appeared before this Court despite service of notice on her. The learned counsel for the petitioner would further contend that even taking into consideration the entire material on record, the offences against the petitioners are not made out and allowing the proceedings to continue would be nothing but harassment and abuse of process of Court and that ends of justice requires that the proceedings ought to be quashed. He would submit that the case of the petitioners fall within categories (1) and (7) enumerated in the case of State of Haryana V. Bhajan lal reported in 1992 (1) SCC 335.

7. Further in support of his contention he would rely on the following judgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court as follows :-

1. Preeti Gupta and another v. State of Jharkhand and others reported in (2010) 7 SCC 667.
2. Varala Bharath Kumar and another v. State of of Telengana and another Preeti Gupta and another v. State of Jharkhand and others reported in (2017) 9 SCC 413.
3. Vineet Kumar and others v. State of Uttar Pradesh and another reported in (2017) 13 SCC 369 wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court had referred and relied on its earlier judgments in Sunder Babu and others v. State of Tamil Nadu reported in (2009) http://www.judis.nic.in 14 SCC 244 and Priy Vrat Singh and others v. Shyam Ji Sahai reported in (2008) 8 SCC 232.
4. State of Haryana and others v. Bhajan lal reported in 1992 (1) SCC 335.
8. Per contra, the learned Government Advocate (crl.side) would submit that the case has been registered based on the complaint given by the defacto complainant. The marriage between the defacto complainant and the first petitioner was solemnised on 29.08.2012 at Chennai. As per defacto complainant, the parents of the defacto complainant had given 75soverigns of gold, 3kgs of Silver and other house hold articles as Sreedhana and addition to that they have also given 16soverigns of Gold jewels and 15lakhs worth about diamonds to the 1st petitioner. The first petitioner had taken the defacto complainant to Australia under Tourist visa and later he had sent her back to India on the guise of calling her after obtaining spouse visa. Later on the instigation of his parents, the first petitioner had demanded Rs.5lakhs to start business. The parents of the defacto complainant had spent Rs.5lakhs at the time of Betrothal and they had also spent Rs.10lakhs for conducting the marriage in a grand manner.

http://www.judis.nic.in

9. In reply the learned counsel for the petitioner would submit there is absolutely no material to show that the first petitioner demanded any dowry to conduct the betrothal or the marriage. Even as per the statement recorded from the witnesses, after the marriage the entire jewels and the other sreedhana articles remained in the custody of the parents of the defacto complainant and neither the first petitioner nor the petitioners 2 and 3 have in possession of the materials belonging to the defacto complainant and thereby there was absolutely no entrustment of any material to make out offence of criminal breach of trust.

10. Despite service of notice, through Court and privately the second respondent/defato complainant did not appear before the Court. Thereby this Court directed the 1st respondent police to intimate the second respondent about the pendency of the case and listing of the matter for hearing. It was reported by the first respondent that the second respondent was residing out of the country and intimation was given to her father who is also a witness in this case and that he has not shown any interest in the case. Since the second respondent did not appear despite intimation this Court appointed Mr.Maruthiraj, legal aid counsel to represent the second respondent.

http://www.judis.nic.in

11. Mr.Maruthiraj, learned legal aid counsel appearing for the second respondent/defacto complainant would submit that as per the available material, the 1st petitioner before his marriage was employed at Australia and there was demand of dowry before the marriage and that the marriage was conducted by the parents of the defacto complainant after spending considerable amount. After the marriage the 1st petitioner had taken the defacto complainant to Australia on tourist visa. There he had harassed the defacto complainant. Whileso, the 2nd and 3rd petitioners have demanded a sum of Rs.5lakhs for starting a business from the father of the defacto complainant. Later under the guise of obtaining a spouse visa, the defacto complainant was sent back to India, the 2nd and 3rd petitioners have prevented the defacto complainant to enter their house demanding the amount for their son and later abused her and her father stating that if only the amount of Rs.5 lakhs is paid, the defacto complainant would be allowed to live with their son. However, he would submit that the materials furnished by the petitioners would go to show that the marriage between the 1st petitioner and the defacto complainant http://www.judis.nic.in was dissolved and thereafter she had married one Arun Govindan on 20.01.2016 at Chennai and she had migrated to Australia and subsequently, the marriage between the defacto complainant and the said Arun Govindan had also been dissolved by the Federal Circuit Court of Australia vide Divorce order in File No:(P)MLC9333/2017 dated 19.12.2017.


12. Heard the counsels. Before adverting to the issues in this case, it is necessary to refer to the relevant paragraphs of the judgment referred to by the counsel for the petitioner.

13. The Hon'ble Apex Court in Preeti Gupta and another V. State of Jharkhand and another reported in (2010) 7 SCC 667 has held as follows :

“20. This Court had occasion to examine the legal position in a large number of cases. In R.P. Kapur v. State of Punjab [AIR 1960 SC 866 : 1960 Cri LJ 1239] this Court summarised some categories of cases where inherent power can and should be exercised to quash the proceedings:
(i) where it manifestly appears that there is a legal bar against the institution or continuance of the proceedings;
(ii) where the allegations in the first information report or complaint taken at their face value http://www.judis.nic.in and accepted in their entirety do not constitute the offence alleged;
(iii) where the allegations constitute an offence, but there is no legal evidence adduced or the evidence adduced clearly or manifestly fails to prove the charge.
21. This Court in State of Karnataka v. L. Muniswamy [(1977) 2 SCC 699 : 1977 SCC (Cri) 404] observed that the wholesome power under Section 482 CrPC entitles the High Court to quash a proceeding when it comes to the conclusion that allowing the proceeding to continue would be an abuse of process of court or that the ends of justice require that the proceeding ought to be quashed. The High Courts have been invested with inherent powers, both in civil and criminal matters, to achieve a salutary public purpose. A court proceeding ought not to be permitted to degenerate into a weapon of harassment or persecution. In this case, the Court observed that ends of justice are higher than the ends of mere law though justice must be administered according to laws made by the legislature. This case has been followed in a large number of subsequent cases of this Court and other courts.


22. In Madhu Limaye v. State of Maharashtra [(1977) 4 SCC 551 : 1978 SCC (Cri) 10] a three-Judge Bench of this Court held as under: (SCC p.

551) “… In case the impugned order clearly brings out a situation which is an abuse of process of court, or for the purpose of securing the ends of justice http://www.judis.nic.in interference of the High Court is absolutely necessary, then nothing contained in Section 397(2) can limit or affect the exercise of the inherent power of the High Court. Such cases would necessarily be few and far between. One such case would be the desirability of the quashing of a criminal proceeding initiated illegally, vexatiously or as being without jurisdiction. The present case would undoubtedly fall for exercise of the power of the High Court in accordance with Section 482 of the 1973 Code even assuming that the invoking of the revisional power of the High Court is impermissible.”

23. This Court in Madhavrao Jiwajirao Scindia v. Sambhajirao Chandrojirao Angre [(1988) 1 SCC 692 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 234] observed in SCC para 7 as under: (SCC p. 695) “7. The legal position is well settled that when a prosecution at the initial stage is asked to be quashed, the test to be applied by the court is as to whether the uncontroverted allegations as made prima facie establish the offence. It is also for the court to take into consideration any special features which appear in a particular case to consider whether it is expedient and in the interest of justice to permit a prosecution to continue. This is so on the basis that the court cannot be utilised for any oblique purpose and where in the opinion of the court chances of an ultimate conviction are bleak and, therefore, no useful purpose is likely to be served by allowing a criminal prosecution to continue, the court may while taking into consideration the special facts of a case also http://www.judis.nic.in quash the proceeding even though it may be at a preliminary stage.” .....

.....

.....

32. It is a matter of common experience that most of these complaints under Section 498-A IPC are filed in the heat of the moment over trivial issues without proper deliberations. We come across a large number of such complaints which are not even bonafide and are filed with oblique motive. At the same time, rapid increase in the number of genuine cases of dowry harassment is also a matter of serious concern. ”

14. In Varala Bharath Kumar and another V. State of Telengana and another reported in (2017) 9 SCC 413 the Hon'ble Apex Court has held :

“5. Respondent 2, though served, has chosen to remain absent. We have heard the learned counsel for the rival parties who are present and perused the record. Having carefully perused the first information report, as well as, the contents of the charge-sheet, we find that the ingredients of Sections 498-A and 406 IPC are not forthcoming. The entire story narrated by the complainant does not attract the aforementioned provisions, as there has not been any dowry demand of the appellants or harassment to the second respondent. Before proceeding further, it would be relevant to note the provisions of Sections 498-A, 405 and 406 of the http://www.judis.nic.in Penal Code, which read thus:
“498-A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty .—Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine. Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, “cruelty” means—
(a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or
(b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.” “405. Criminal breach of trust .—Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that property, or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of http://www.judis.nic.in such trust, or wilfully suffers any other person so to do, commits “criminal breach of trust”.
Explanation 1.—A person, being an employer of an establishment whether exempted under Section 17 of the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 (19 of 1952), or not who deducts the employee's contribution from the wages payable to the employee for credit to a Provident Fund or Family Pension Fund established by any law for the time being in force, shall be deemed to have been entrusted with the amount of the contribution so deducted by him and if he makes default in the payment of such contribution to the said fund in violation of the said law, shall be deemed to have dishonestly used the amount of the said contribution in violation of a direction of law as aforesaid.

Explanation 2.—A person, being an employer, who deducts the employees' contribution from the wages payable to the employee for credit to the Employees' State Insurance Fund held and administered by the Employees' State Insurance Corporation established under the Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948 (34 of 1948), shall be deemed to have been entrusted with the amount of the contribution so deducted by him and if he makes default in the payment of such contribution to the said Fund in violation of the said Act, shall be deemed to have dishonestly used the amount of the said contribution in violation of a direction of law as aforesaid. http://www.judis.nic.in

406. Punishment for criminal breach of trust .— Whoever commits criminal breach of trust shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.”

6. It is by now well settled that the extraordinary power under Article 226 or inherent power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure can be exercised by the High Court, either to prevent abuse of process of the court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. Where allegations made in the first information report/the complaint or the outcome of investigation as found in the charge- sheet, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out the case against the accused; where the allegations do not disclose the ingredients of the offence alleged; where the uncontroverted allegations made in the first information report or complaint and the material collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of offence alleged and make out a case against the accused; where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge, the power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India or under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure may be exercised. http://www.judis.nic.in

7. While exercising power under Section 482 or under Article 226 in such matters, the court does not function as a court of appeal or revision. Inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code though wide has to be exercised sparingly, carefully or with caution and only when such exercise is justified by the tests specifically laid down under Section 482 itself. It is to be exercised ex debito justitiae to do real and substantial justice, for the administration of which alone courts exist. The court must be careful and see that its decision in exercise of its power is based on sound principles. The inherent powers should not be exercised to stifle a legitimate prosecution. Of course, no hard-and-fast rule can be laid down in regard to cases in which the High Court will exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction of quashing the proceedings at any stage.


8. We are conscious of the fact that, Section 498-A was added to the Code with a view to punish the husband or any of his relatives, who harass or torture the wife to coerce her or her relatives to satisfy unlawful demands of dowry. Keeping the aforementioned object in mind, we have dealt with the matter. We do not find any allegation of subjecting the complainant to cruelty within the meaning of Section 498-A IPC. The records at hand could not disclose any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the complainant to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to http://www.judis.nic.in life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the complainant. So also, there is nothing on record to show that there was a demand of dowry by the appellants or any of their relatives, either prior to the marriage, during the marriage or after the marriage. The record also does not disclose anywhere that the husband of the complainant acted, with a view to coerce her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand of any property or valuable security.


9. The ingredients of criminal breach of trust are also not forthcoming from the records as against the appellants. The allegations contained in the complaint and the charge-sheet do not satisfy the definition of criminal breach of trust, as contained in Section 405 IPC. In view of the blurred allegations, and as we find that the complainant is only citing the incidents of unhappiness with her husband, no useful purpose will be served in continuing the prosecution against the appellants. This is a case where there is a total absence of allegations for the offences punishable under Section 498-A and Section 406 IPC. In the matter on hand, the allegations made in the first information report as well as the material collected during the investigation, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety, do not prima facie constitute the offences punishable under Sections 498-A and 406 IPC against the appellant-accused. So also the uncontroverted allegations found against the appellants do not http://www.judis.nic.in disclose the commission of the offence alleged and make out a case against the accused. The proceedings initiated against the appellants are liable to be quashed.

15. In Vineet Kumar and others v. State of Uttar Pradesh and another reported in (2017) 13 SCC 369 the Hon'ble Apex Court has held :

                                         “26. A     three-Judge           Bench       in State   of
                              Karnataka v. M. Devendrappa              had the occasion to
                              consider   the      ambit    of    Section        482    CrPC.     By
analysing the scope of Section 482 CrPC, this Court laid down that authority of the Court exists for advancement of justice and if any attempt is made to abuse that authority so as to produce injustice the Court has power to prevent abuse. It further held that Court would be justified to quash any proceeding if it finds that initiation/continuance of it amounts to abuse of the process of court or quashing of these proceedings would otherwise serve the ends of justice. The following was laid down in para 6 :

“6. … All courts, whether civil or criminal possess, in the absence of any express provision, as inherent in their constitution, all such powers as are necessary to do the right and to undo a wrong in course of administration of justice on the principle quando lex aliquid alicui concedit, concedere videtur et id sine quo res ipsae esse non potest (when the law gives a person anything it gives him that without which it http://www.judis.nic.in cannot exist). While exercising powers under the section, the court does not function as a court of appeal or revision. Inherent jurisdiction under the section though wide has to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with caution and only when such exercise is justified by the tests specifically laid down in the section itself. It is to be exercised ex debito justitiae to do real and substantial justice for the administration of which alone courts exist. Authority of the court exists for advancement of justice and if any attempt is made to abuse that authority so as to produce injustice, the court has power to prevent abuse. It would be an abuse of process of the court to allow any action which would result in injustice and prevent promotion of justice. In exercise of the powers court would be justified to quash any proceeding if it finds that initiation/continuance of it amounts to abuse of the process of court or quashing of these proceedings would otherwise serve the ends of justice. When no offence is disclosed by the complaint, the court may examine the question of fact. When a complaint is sought to be quashed, it is permissible to look into the materials to assess what the complainant has alleged and whether any offence is made out even if the allegations are accepted in toto.”

27. Further in para 8 the following was stated: [State of Karnataka v. M. Devendrappa, (2002) 3 SCC 89 http://www.judis.nic.in “8. … Judicial process should not be an instrument of oppression, or, needless harassment. Court should be circumspect and judicious in exercising discretion and should take all relevant facts and circumstances into consideration before issuing process, lest it would be an instrument in the hands of a private complainant to unleash vendetta to harass any person needlessly. At the same time the section is not an instrument handed over to an accused to short-circuit a prosecution and bring about its sudden death. The scope of exercise of power under Section 482 of the Code and the categories of cases where the High Court may exercise its power under it relating to cognizable offences to prevent abuse of process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice were set out in some detail by this Court in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335”

28. In Sunder Babu v. State of T.N. [Sunder Babu v. State of T.N., (2009) 14 SCC 244, this Court was considering the challenge to the order of the Madras High Court where application was under Section 482 CrPC to quash criminal proceedings under Section 498-A IPC and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. It was contended before this Court that the complaint filed was nothing but an abuse of the process of law and allegations were unfounded. The prosecuting agency contested the petition filed under Section 482 CrPC taking the stand that a bare perusal of the complaint http://www.judis.nic.in discloses commission of alleged offences and, therefore, it is not a case which needed to be allowed. The High Court accepted the case of the prosecution and dismissed the application. This Court referred to the judgment in Bhajan Lal case and held that the case fell within Category 7. The Apex Court relying on Category 7 has held that the application under Section 482 deserved to be allowed and it quashed the proceedings.

29. In another case in Priya Vrat Singh v. Shyam Ji Sahai, this Court relied on Category 7 as laid down in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal. In the above case the Allahabad High Court had dismissed an application filed under Section 482 CrPC to quash the proceedings under Sections 494, 120-B and 109 IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. After noticing the background facts and parameters for exercise of power under Section 482 CrPC the following was stated in paras 8 to 12: (Priya Vrat v. Shyam Ji Sahai, (2008) 8 SCC “8. Further, it is pointed out that the allegation of alleged demand for dowry was made for the first time in December 1994. In the complaint filed, the allegation is that the dowry torture was made sometime in 1992. It has not been explained as to why for more than two years no action was taken.

9. Further, it appears that in the complaint petition apart from the husband, the mother of the husband, the subsequently married http://www.judis.nic.in wife, husband's mother's sister, husband's brother-in-law and Sunita's father were impleaded as party. No role has been specifically ascribed to anybody except the husband and that too of a dowry demand in February 1993 when the complaint was filed on 6-12-1994 i.e. nearly after 22 months. It is to be noted that in spite of service of notice, none has appeared on behalf of Respondent 1.”

16. In State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal and others reported in (1992) 1 SCC 335 the Hon'ble Apex Court has held :

“102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of the Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article 226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code which we have extracted and reproduced above, we give the following categories of cases by way of illustration wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be exercised.
http://www.judis.nic.in (1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code. (3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused. (4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code.
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the concerned Act (under http://www.judis.nic.in which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.
103. We also give a note of caution to the effect that the power of quashing a criminal proceeding should be exercised very sparingly and with circumspection and that too in the rarest of rare cases; that the court will not be justified in embarking upon an enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the allegations made in the FIR or the complaint and that the extraordinary or inherent powers do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the court to act according to its whim or caprice. ”

17. Now while perusing the materials on record in this case, the allegations in the complaint is that the marriage between the defacto complainant and the 1st petitioner was solemnised on 29.08.2012 at Chennai and the marriage was conducted in a very grand manner by spending a sum of Rs.30lakhs, at the time of http://www.judis.nic.in marriage her parents had given 75 Soverigns of Gold jewels, 3kgs of Silver article and other house hold articles as Sreedhana. In addition to that they have also gifted 16 Soverigns of Gold jewels to A1/1st petitioner and after the marriage, the 1st petitioner had left to Australia for his employment on 15.09.2012 and later the defacto complainant had gone to Australia after mortgaging part of her jewels for Rs.3lakhs. The further allegation is that the 2 nd and 3rd petitioners had demanded a sum of Rs.5lakhs from the parents of the defacto complainant for starting a business and thereafter, she was sent back to India in the guise of obtaining spouse visa and she came back to her parent's house in India and that the 2nd and 3rd petitioners prevented the defacto complainant from entering the matrimonial house demanding a sum of Rs.5lakhs for starting business for the first petitioner. Thereafter, the defacto complainant had given a complaint. Admittedly as per the statements recorded form the witnesses the jewels gifted to the defacto complainant during her marriage were in her custody only and that she had only mortgaged jewels and taken Rs.3lakhs for obtaining visa to Australia. Further, in this case after registration of the case, the matter had been referred to the District Social Welfare Officer/Dowry Prohibition Officer for enquiry. In the meanwhile, the defacto complainant had preferred a complaint http://www.judis.nic.in before the State Women's Commission and had also preferred a complaint before the Judicial Magistrate, Alandur under the Domestic Violence Act. The 1st petitioner had filed a petition for divorce on the ground of cruelty, the marriage had been dissolved on 17.06.2015, thereafter the defacto complainant has not proceeded further. The complaint filed by the defacto complainant before the State Women's Commission and the Judicial Magistrate, Alandur were also closed on account of non appearance of the complainant. Subsequently, the defacto complainant had also married one Arun Govindan on 20.01.2016 and the defacto complainant migrated to Australia and the marriage between the defacto complainant and the said Arun Govindan has been dissolved by the Federal Circuit Court of Australia vide Divorce order in File No:(P)MLC9333/2017 dated 19.12.2017. The 1st petitioner has also got married with one Vamsaroopa Surapareddy and he has also got a child. In the meanwhile, the 1st petitioner has completed the investigation and filed final report. Despite service of notice, the defacto complainant has not shown any interest in prosecuting the case. Further, it is reported that the defacto complainant is settled abroad and that her father had also not shown any interest in pursuing the matter. http://www.judis.nic.in

18. In such circumstances, this Court perused the complaint and the materials available in CC.No.470 of 2014 pending on the file of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Egmore, Chennai. Perusal and analysis of materials including the statements show that the entire sreedhana articles and other house hold articles were left back in the custody of the defacto complainant and there are no materials to show that first petitioner or his parents are holding the properties. Further, the allegations against the petitioners in respect of demand of dowry and matrimonial cruelty by the petitioners are also vague and blurred. The reading of the complaint does not expose any cruelty within the meaning of Section 498A IPC. Further, the materials on hand do not disclose any wilful conduct on the part of the petitioners which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the complainant to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical). Further, the allegations of demand of dowry by the petitioners prior to the marriage, during the marriage or after the marriage is also vague. The ingredients of criminal breach of trust are also not forthcoming from the records as against the petitioners. Since, it is the admitted case of the defacto complainant that the entire properties and jewels were left in the custody of the defacto complainant. The allegations http://www.judis.nic.in contained in the complaint and the charge sheet do not satisfy the definition of criminal breach of trust, as contained in Section 405 IPC. The allegations made in the FIR as well as the materials collected do not prima facie constitute the offence alleged against the petitioners. Further, after the complaint to the police, the defacto complainant has also filed complaints against the petitioners before the State Women's Commission and before the Judicial Magistrate, Alandur under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. Since, the defacto complainant did not follow up the cases, they were also dismissed for non prosecution. It could be seen that the complaint has been filed out of matrimonial misunderstanding in the heat of the moment over certain trivial issues without proper deliberations. It is also brought to the notice of this Court that subsequently the marriage between the first petitioner and the defacto complainant had been dissolved by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Chennai in OP.No.3587 of 2013 on the ground of cruelty on 17.06.2015. Subsequent to the divorce, the defacto complainant did not proceed further and later she has got married to one Arun Govindan on 20.01.2016 at Chennai and she got migrated to Australia. Thereafter, the marriage between the defacto complainant and the said Arun Govindan has been dissolved by the http://www.judis.nic.in Federal Circuit Court of Australia. Since, the defacto complainant did not pursue the complaint filed before the Judicial Magistrate, Alandur, it was dismissed for non prosecution on 18.09.2015. After 2015, the defacto complainant had also not proceeded further. Now both parties have started their own lives and happily married again and are settled in different countries. The defacto complainant has not appeared before the Court, despite notice. Further it is also reported by the first respondent that the father of the defacto complainant who is a witness in this case has also not shown any interest in this case.


19. Under such circumstances, this Court is of the opinion that allowing the petitioners to face the prosecution would be an exercise in futility amounting to abuse of process of Court. Further this Court is also of the opinion that this case squarely falls under the categories (3) and (7) in Paragraph 102 of Bhajan Lal case (cited supra). As stated above, since no useful purpose will be served in allowing the proceedings to be continued, it requires interference of this Court by exercising jurisdiction under section 482 Cr.PC.


20. In view of the above, the Crl.OP.No.26929 of 2015 http://www.judis.nic.in stands allowed and consequently, the proceedings pending against the petitioners in CC.No.470 of 2014 on the file of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Egmore, Chennai stands quashed. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.

21. Mr.H.Maruthiraj, learned legal aid counsel appointed by this Court for the second respondent/defacto complainant is entitled for remuneration as per rules.

1. List has been revised.

2. Supplementary affidavit filed today is taken on record.

3. Heard Sri Gaurav Kakkar, learned counsel for the applicant, Sri Sunil Kumar, learned A.G.A. for the State and perused the record.

4. Applicant seeks bail in Case Crime No.0038 of 2024, under Sections 498A, 304B I.P.C. and Section 3/4 D.P. Act, Police Station Shivkuti, District Prayagraj, during the pendency of trial.

PROSECUTION STORY:

5. The marriage of the niece of the informant was solemnized with the applicant on 22.04.2019 and subsequent to it, the applicant and other family members are stated to have subjected her to cruelty for demand of dowry, thereby committed her murder on 13.03.2024.

6. The applicant is stated to have given the said information to the informant on the same day at 7:38 a.m. regarding the death of his wife.

ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF APPLICANT:

7. The applicant is absolutely innocent and has been falsely implicated in the present case. He has nothing to do with the said offence.

8. The FIR is delayed by about 11 hours and there is no explanation of the said delay caused.

9. The FIR indicates that the applicant has committed the murder of the niece of the informant, but the post-mortem report indicates that the cause of death was asphyxia as a result of ante-mortem hanging.

10. There is no particular inkling of demand of dowry from the deceased person. The allegations are vague.

11. It was a love marriage and the deceased could not bear a child after five years of her marriage and was depressed as such and had committed suicide. The said fact of suicide stand fortified from the statement of the landlord Ashok Singh, who has categorically stated that in his presence, the door was broken open and the deceased was found hanging to the ceiling.

12. Reliance has been placed on certain WhatsApp chats between the deceased and the applicant, which too indicate that there was discord between the two, but what impelled the deceased to commit suicide is not known to anyone.

13. It was a inter-cast marriage as well and the applicant belongs to scheduled cast and the deceased person belonged to general category.

14. Several other submissions have been made on behalf of the applicant to demonstrate the falsity of the allegations made against him. The circumstances which, as per counsel, led to the false implication of the applicant have also been touched upon at length.

15. There is no criminal history of the applicant. The applicant is languishing in jail since 14.03.2024 and is ready to cooperate with trial. In case, the applicant is released on bail, he will not misuse the liberty of bail.

ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF STATE/INFORMANT:

16. The bail application has been opposed on the ground that the demand of dowry has come up in the statement of the informant recorded subsequently by the Investigating Officer under Section 161 Cr.P.C.

CONCLUSION:

17. ?The well-known principle of ""Presumption of Innocence Unless Proven Guilty,"" gives rise to the concept of bail as a rule and imprisonment as an exception.

18. ?A person's right to life and liberty, guaranteed by Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, cannot be taken away simply because the person is accused of committing an offence until the guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt. Article 21 of the Indian Constitution states that no one's life or personal liberty may be taken away unless the procedure established by law is followed, and the procedure must be just and reasonable. The said principle has been recapitulated by the Supreme Court in Satender Kumar Antil vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and Ors., 2022 INSC 690.

19. ?Reiterating the aforesaid view the Supreme Court in the case of Manish Sisodia vs. Directorate of Enforcement, 2024 INSC 595 has again emphasised that the very well-settled principle of law that bail is not to be withheld as a punishment is not to be forgotten. It is high time that the Courts should recognize the principle that ""bail is a rule and jail is an exception"".

20. ?Learned A.G.A. could not bring forth any exceptional circumstances which would warrant denial of bail to the applicant.

21. ?It is settled principle of law that the object of bail is to secure the attendance of the accused at the trial. No material particulars or circumstances suggestive of the applicant fleeing from justice or thwarting the course of justice or creating other troubles in the shape of repeating offences or intimidating witnesses and the like have been shown by learned A.G.A.

22. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, submissions made by learned counsel for the parties, the evidence on record, and without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, the Court is of the view that the applicant has made out a case for bail. The bail application is allowed.

23. Let the applicant-Devendra Singh Alias Rinku involved in aforementioned case crime number be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned subject to following conditions.

(i) The applicant shall not tamper with evidence.
(ii) The applicant shall remain present, in person, before the Trial Court on dates fixed for (1) opening of the case, (2) framing of charge and (3) recording of statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C/351 B.N.S.S. If in the opinion of the Trial Court absence of the applicant is deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall be open for the Trial Court to treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed against him in accordance with law.
24. In case of breach of any of the above conditions, it shall be a ground for cancellation of bail. Identity, status and residence proof of the applicant and sureties be verified by the court concerned before the bonds are accepted.

25. It is made clear that observations made in granting bail to the applicant shall not in any way affect the learned trial Judge in forming his independent opinion based on the testimony of the witnesses.

(Judgment of the Court was delivered by SUNDER MOHAN, J.) The unsuccessful husband has filed the above appeals challenging the dismissal of his petition for divorce in O.P.No.3476 of 2008 and allowing of the petition filed by the wife in O.P.No.976 of 2010 for restitution of conjugal rights by the learned V Additional Principal Judge, Family Court, Chennai.


2. For the sake of convenience, the appellant hereinafter is referred to as husband and the respondent, as wife.

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022

3. The husband had filed a petition in O.P.No.3476 of 2008 before the V Additional Family Court, Chennai for divorce on the ground of cruelty by making the following averments.

(a) The marriage between the husband and wife took place on 22.05.2005 at Tutocorin. After marriage, they started their matrimonial life at Chennai. At the time of marriage, the appellant was employed in a company at USA. The husband took the wife to USA on 20.06.2005, since the visa process could not be completed till then. He had taken a lot of care to make the wife comfortable during the stay in USA. However, the wife due to her conduct, made the relationship difficult. The respondent was in the habit of abusing the husband in filthy language. She always made threats of filing of a false complaint and ensure that the husband loses his job. She was in the habit of sending e mails containing abusive language which would reflect her sadistic approach.
(b) The respondent wife never allowed the husband to meet his friends and always suspected the character of the husband. She made false accusations of the husband having illicit relationship with other women. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022 The wife sent an e-mail to the husband on 26.03.2007 stating that she could have lodged a complaint against the husband and his relatives under section 498A IPC. Even during casual conversations, she would threaten the husband of false complaints. The respondent behaved in an unruly manner and on several occasions banged her head on the wall to ensure that the husband comes to her terms.

(c) The wife threatened of committing suicide while the husband was away in USA which forced the parents of the husband to give a complaint about the respondent to the Inspector of Police, Ashok Nagar Police Station.

(d)The wife had sent an e-mail to his employer and to the Embassy making false allegations against the husband. The husband came to know of the e-mails when the employer asked for explanation from him. Realising that the marriage had irretrievably broken down, the husband sent a legal notice on 05.09.2008 to the respondent and the said notice was returned, unserved and hence he filed the petition for divorce. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022 4 (a) The wife filed a counter denying the averments made in the petition for divorce. She was subjected to cruelty by the husband's mother. However, she never complained the same to the husband because, he would feel troubled or burdened. She was always a dutiful wife. She had sent a few e-mails only due to her love and affection. She did not intend to bother the husband. On certain occasions when the husband did not care for the wife, she had sent e-mails to express her mental agony. She had always satisfied the sexual needs of the husband, even though on certain days, she was not willing and unwell. During one occasion, where the husband and wife were in intimacy, the husband uttered the name of another girl which wounded the wife. When she was subjected to harassment in the form of physical and verbal abuse, she informed the husband that she had a right to give a complaint under section 498A IPC.

4(b) On 24.01.2011 when she went to meet the husband in his office, she was kicked and beaten up by the husband. She was treated in a hospital where she took CT scan, which revealed that she had sustained internal injuries. Though the husband committed an offence, she refrained https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022 from giving any complaint in order to preserve the marriage. The husband never cared for the child and he was in the habit of provoking the wife and in such situations, the wife had employed harsh language due to her frustration and that is sought to be blown out of proportion by the husband, as acts of cruelty. The husband and wife went for counselling by a Psychiatrist and the husband refused to cooperate in the counselling sessions because of his adamant attitude.


5. Two years after the petition filed by the husband, the wife has filed O.P.No.976 of 2010 for restitution of conjugal rights reiterating the averments made in the counter in the divorce petition. Likewise, the husband filed a counter in the restitution of conjugal rights petition in O.P.No.976 of 2010 reiterating the averments made in his divorce petition.

6. Before the Family Court, the husband examined himself as PW1 and marked Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.9. The wife examined herself and her sister as RW1 and RW2 and marked Exhibits Ex.R.1 to R5.

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022

7. The V Additional Principal Judge, Family Court, Chennai dismissed the petition filed by the husband for divorce stating that the husband had not proved the allegations of cruelty against the wife. The V Additional Principal Judge, Family Court, Chennai allowed the petition filed by the wife for restitution of conjugal rights stating that her petition was bonafide and she is entitled to conjugal rights.

8. Aggrieved over the dismissal of divorce petition in O.P.No.3476 of 2008 and allowing the petition for restitution of conjugal rights by the V Additional Principal Judge, Family Court, Chennai, the husband has filed the present appeals in C.M.A.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 respectively.

9(a) When the case was posted for the arguments of the respondent/wife's counsel, the counsel sought permission of this court to take up CMP.No.20442 of 2022 filed before this court seeking to let in additional evidence by marking few documents viz;

1. screenshot of the e-mails sent by husband's girl friend to wife with photo attachment https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022

2. pendrive with the conversation between husband's girl friend and the wife with transcript.

9(b) In the said CMP.No.20244 of 2022, the husband filed a counter denying the contents of the said e-mail and submitted that in any case, the authenticity of the e-mail communications has not been established. The wife cannot be allowed to mark documents which have not been proved and tested by cross examination at the belated stage after the appellant/husband's counsel made his submissions.

9(c) We find that the documents sought to be let in as additional evidence is an e-mail communication said to have been sent by a person with whom, the appellant is said to have had extra marital relationship and a pen drive which is said to contain the conversation between the said person with the wife. In our view, the said documents cannot be taken as additional evidence in the absence of proper proof. Hence, we dismiss C.M.P.No.20242 of 2022 seeking permission to wife to let in additional evidence by marking documents.

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022 10(a) Mr.K.Chellapandian, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant/husband submitted that the wife committed cruelty in many ways. The documents filed by the husband would show the cruelty meted out to him. Besides that, the wife in the counter filed to the divorce petition and in the petition for restitution of conjugal rights and during her cross examination, has admitted to certain facts which will clearly establish that the husband suffered mental cruelty. The learned counsel read to us the e-mails sent by the wife to the husband which were marked as Exs.P3, P6 and P7, in which, the wife had threatened the husband of filing a complaint against him and his relatives for an offence under section 498A IPC. A reading of the materials would also suggest that she had used unparliamentary language against the husband besides making indecent comments about him. She had also made a complaint to the employer of the husband stating that he had started a company contrary to the interest of the employer. Because of these e-mails, the husband not only suffered mental agony, but was called upon to give explanation to his employer, which emotionally disturbed him. The husband had to change jobs only because of the conduct of the wife in giving complaint to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022 all his employers. Ex.P.4, which is CSR receipt would show that the parents of the husband gave a complaint to Ashok Nagar Police Station stating that the wife had threatened of committing suicide.

10(b) The learned Senior Counsel further submitted that the appellant and the respondent are living separately since 2010. The marriage has become dead and has irretrievably broken down. He further submitted that the wife also made false allegations of adultery against the husband and that he led an immoral life. The learned Senior Counsel relied upon the following judgments of the Apex Court in support of his submission where the conduct of the parties suggest that the matrimonial bond is beyond repair, the marriage would become sham and dejure declaration of dissolution of marriage is necessary to the marriage which is already dead defacto:

(a) Naveen Kohli Vs. Neelu Kohli reported in AIR 2006 (SC) 1675;
(b) Samar Ghosh Vs. Jaya Ghosh reported in 2007 (4) SCC 511 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022
(c) K. Srinivas Rao Vs. D.A. Deepa reported in 2013 (5) SCC 226
(d) Sukhendu Das Vs. Rita Mukherjee reported in 2017 (9) SCC 632
(e) Order passed by this Court in CMA.No.3249 of 2017, dated 05.07.2022
(f) Order passed by this Court in CMA.No.1319 of 2014, dated 21.07.2022 11(a) Per contra, the learned counsel for the wife submitted that the wife had not made any false allegations against the husband and in fact, the petition filed by him to let in additional evidence by marking a few photographs and e-mails sent by the husband's girl friend to the wife to show that the husband cheated on the wife.
11(b) The learned counsel for the respondent/wife further submitted that the allegations made against the wife were without any basis. Trivial incidents which is common in any marriage is sought to be exaggerated. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022 The words spoken by the wife, when she was emotionally disturbed by the conduct of the husband, cannot be taken as acts of cruelty. These are acts which is only a normal wear and tear in any marriage. The husband is a wrong doer and he is seeking to take advantage of his own wrong and therefore he is not entitled to any relief, as per Section 23 of the Hindu Marriage Act.


11(c) The learned counsel further submitted that the e-mails marked as Ex.P.3 and Ex.P.6 were not e-mails sent by the wife and the husband had fabricated the e-mails to make it appear that the wife committed cruelty. Ex.P.7 e-mail is admitted by the wife. The e-mail IDs in Ex.P.7 and the e-mail ID in Ex.P.3 and Ex.P.6 would show that they are different. The wife had never used the e-mail ID mentioned in Ex.P.3 and Ex.P.6. The wife always mentioned her name as 'Sunandhini Rajkumar' and not as ""Sunandhini Vivekanandan"" as found in ExP.3 and Ex.P.6 e-mails. Therefore the e-mails cannot be put against the wife to show that she committed cruelty.

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022 11 (d) Further, Ex.P.4 is a Xerox copy of an alleged CSR receipt issued by the police. The said document cannot be relied upon since the husband has not filed the original of the said receipt. The husband is guilty of committing various wrongs and based on the fault theory, which means that he can seek divorce only on the ground of opponent's fault and not when he is guilty of committing a wrong. The learned counsel therefore, submitted that isolated incidents which, if taken as a whole, would only amount to trivial irritations, quarrels and normal wear and tear of marriage life which happens in families. Those instances cannot be the basis for holding that the wife is guilty of cruelty. The learned counsel relied upon the following Judgments of Hon'ble Apex Court in support of his submissions:

1. Chetan Dass Vs. Kamala Devi reported in 2001(4)SCC250.
2. Neelam Kumar vs. Dayarani reported in 2010 13 SCC 298.
3. Gurbux Singh vs. Harminder Kaur reported 2010 (14) SCC 301
4.Darshan Gupta Vs. Radhika Gupta reported in 2013 (9) SCC 1
5. Ramachander vs. Ananta reported in 2015(11) SCC 539 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022
6.Mangayakarasi vs. M. Yuvaraj reported in 2020(3) SC 786 The learned counsel also relied upon the Judgement of this Court in P.Manimekalai vs. R.Kothandaraman reported in 2010 (6) CTC 80
12. Heard the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant/husband and learned counsel appearing for the respondent/wife and perused the pleadings, evidence both oral and documentary.

13. Admittedly, the marriage between the husband and the respondent took place in the year 2005. The allegations and counter allegations made by the husband and wife against each other would show that the relationship was not conducive and peaceful since 2007. It is also an admitted fact that they have been living separately since 2010. Though we are rejecting the application filed by the wife for letting in additional evidence, since the documents sought to be adduced has to be proved in accordance with law, however, we may note that the wife has made certain allegations in the affidavit filed in support of the said petition that the husband had extra marital relationship. The wife has also made certain https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022 averments in the counter filed to the divorce petition which would suggest that she had suffered cruelty at the hands of the husband. Infact, in the counter, she had admitted that she had sent a few e-mails in anguish to the husband, though during her cross examination before the court, she would deny the specific e-mails shown to her. She had also admitted that though she has suffered cruelty at the hands of the husband, she only threatened her husband of filing complaint against him and never filed any complaint. She also admits in her proof affidavit that she made a threat of suicide on one occasion and the parents of the husband gave complaint against her. The respondent wife while denying Ex.P.3 and Ex.P.6 e-mails, had given a vague answer during her cross examination when a question was put by the counsel as to whether the e-mail Id shown was hers. She had said that it may be hers. The respondent/wife further when confronted with the contents of the e-mails, she would say that the e-mails were not sent by her, but she would admit that she had told the husband that she would file a complaint under Section 498A IPC and that she also told that she would commit suicide.

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022

14. Ex.P.7 is admitted by the wife. It is an e-mail sent by the wife to the employer of the husband, wherein, she had accused the husband of running another company. To the said e-mail sent by the wife, the employer of the husband had stated that the allegations are serious and they would like to investigate this matter in detail. The respondent had sent another reminder on 13.3.2012 asking for details of the result of the investigation conducted by the employer. The employer had replied on the same day stating that the husband had resigned the job. The exchange of the e-mails between the wife and the employer of the husband narrated above which is marked as Ex.P.7 would show the conduct of the wife. This in our view is bound to cause mental cruelty to the husband. The e-mails show that the husband had resigned the job pursuant to the letter written by the wife to the employer of the husband. Though Ex.P.3 and Ex.P.6 are denied by the wife, the wife has admitted that she had made threats of suicide and also threatened of filing a complaint under Section 498A IPC against the husband and his relatives.

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022

15. The wife had not taken any steps for re-union and would admit that she had filed a petition for restitution of conjugal rights 15 months after the husband had filed a petition for divorce. Further Ex.P.4 would show that the husband's parents were also subjected to mental agony which forced them to give a complaint to the Ashok Nagar Police Station that the wife threatened to commit suicide. These instances are bound to cause mental cruelty to the husband who has been living in USA.

16. The narration of the facts stated above would show that the allegations and counter allegations of the husband and wife are such that the incidents cannot be considered trivial. The husband losing a job or resigning a job on account of the wife's sending a letter to his employer, threats of suicide, threats of filing a complaint under Section 498A IPC, cannot be brushed aside as trivial instances. Though the learned counsel for the wife would submit that these are normal wear and tear in any married life and the wife did it out of love and affection and not harm the husband, we are unable to persuade ourselves with the said submission. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022

17. Appreciation of mental cruelty in civil law and criminal law are different. In criminal law, the intention of the offender is relevant, whereas in the civil law, the agony that would cause to one party to the marriage on account of the other party's conduct is relevant, even if the other party's acts were not deliberate and intentional. However, in this case, we find that the wife's act cannot be called as unintentional from the facts and circumstances of the case.


18.The Judgments relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondent, for the proposition that:

(a)(i) Irretrievable breakdown of marriage cannot be applied in a Straight Jacket Formula.
(ii) The party seeking relief cannot be allowed to take advantage of his own wrong and seek relief on that ground (Chetan Dass Vs. Kamala Devi 2001(4)SCC250)(para-19)
(b)Trivial irritations and isolated incidents cannot be characterized as cruelty. The party seeking divorce has to allege and prove which part of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022 the conduct caused cruelty to him/her (Gurbux Singh vs. Harminder Kaur 2010 (14) SCC 301.para16)
(c) In order to establish mental cruelty, the Court has to ascertain whether the impact of the conduct of one spouse had caused reasonable apprehension in the mind of the other spouse that it would be harmful or injurious to live together. (P.Manimekalai vs. R.Kothandaraman 2010 (6) CTC 80) (para 12 and 13)
(d) The party to marriage who by his/her own conduct contributed to the breakdown of marriage cannot seek divorce (Neelam Kumar vs. Dayarani 2010 13 SCC 298. Para 14)
(e) In matrimonial Jurisprudence the grounds mentioned for divorce in Section 13 (1) of Hindu Marriage Act would show that they are based on fault theory which means that divorce can be granted only on the opponent's fault and not on one's own fault. (Darshan Gupta Vs. Radhika Gupta 2013 (9) SCC 1. Para 46 )
(f) The instances of cruelty cannot be taken in isolation but the cumulative effect of facts and circumstances of the case has to be taken to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022 ascertain whether the person seeking divorce had been subjected to mental cruelty. (Ramachander vs. Ananta 2015(11) SCC 539 para10).
(g) The rule relating to continuous separation and irretrievable break down of marriage cannot be in a Straight Jacket Formula. In a case where the differences are not of such magnitude, the marriage cannot be dissolved merely because the parties have been living separately and litigating for quite sometime. (Mangayakarasi vs. M. Yuvaraj 2020(3)SC786) para 15).
There is no dispute with the above propositions of law. However the Courts have to bear in mind while deciding a petition for divorce, they are dealing with “the Husband”, “the Wife” and “the Marriage”. The facts in each case would be different and mental cruelty has to be assessed in the facts and circumstances of each case. In the case on hand, we have elaborated the facts. The established facts would show that the conduct of the wife is bound to cause mental cruelty to the husband. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022

19. The Honourable Apex Court in the case of “Samar Ghosh v. Jaya Ghosh, reported in (2007) 4 SCC 511 : 2007 SCC OnLine SC 423” , held as follows;

'101. No uniform standard can ever be laid down for guidance, yet we deem it appropriate to enumerate some instances of human behaviour which may be relevant in dealing with the cases of “mental cruelty”. The instances indicated in the succeeding paragraphs are only illustrative and not exhaustive:

(i) On consideration of complete matrimonial life of the parties, acute mental pain, agony and suffering as would not make possible for the parties to live with each other could come within the broad parameters of mental cruelty.
(ii) On comprehensive appraisal of the entire matrimonial life of the parties, it becomes abundantly clear that situation is such that the wronged party cannot reasonably be asked to put up with such conduct and continue to live with other party.
(iii) Mere coldness or lack of affection cannot amount https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022 to cruelty, frequent rudeness of language, petulance of manner, indifference and neglect may reach such a degree that it makes the married life for the other spouse absolutely intolerable.
(iv) Mental cruelty is a state of mind. The feeling of deep anguish, disappointment, frustration in one spouse caused by the conduct of other for a long time may lead to mental cruelty.
(v) A sustained course of abusive and humiliating treatment calculated to torture, discommode or render miserable life of the spouse.
(vi) Sustained unjustifiable conduct and behaviour of one spouse actually affecting physical and mental health of the other spouse. The treatment complained of and the resultant danger or apprehension must be very grave, substantial and weighty.
(vii) Sustained reprehensible conduct, studied neglect, indifference or total departure from the normal standard of conjugal kindness causing injury to mental health or deriving sadistic pleasure can also amount to mental cruelty.
(viii) The conduct must be much more than jealousy, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022 selfishness, possessiveness, which causes unhappiness and dissatisfaction and emotional upset may not be a ground for grant of divorce on the ground of mental cruelty.
(ix) Mere trivial irritations, quarrels, normal wear and tear of the married life which happens in day-to-
day life would not be adequate for grant of divorce on the ground of mental cruelty.

(x) The married life should be reviewed as a whole and a few isolated instances over a period of years will not amount to cruelty. The ill conduct must be persistent for a fairly lengthy period, where the relationship has deteriorated to an extent that because of the acts and behaviour of a spouse, the wronged party finds it extremely difficult to live with the other party any longer, may amount to mental cruelty.

(xi) If a husband submits himself for an operation of sterilisation without medical reasons and without the consent or knowledge of his wife and similarly, if the wife undergoes vasectomy or abortion without medical reason or without the consent or knowledge of her husband, such an act of the spouse may lead to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022 mental cruelty.

(xii) Unilateral decision of refusal to have intercourse for considerable period without there being any physical incapacity or valid reason may amount to mental cruelty.

(xiii) Unilateral decision of either husband or wife after marriage not to have child from the marriage may amount to cruelty.

(xiv) Where there has been a long period of continuous separation, it may fairly be concluded that the matrimonial bond is beyond repair. The marriage becomes a fiction though supported by a legal tie. By refusing to sever that tie, the law in such cases, does not serve the sanctity of marriage; on the contrary, it shows scant regard for the feelings and emotions of the parties. In such like situations, it may lead to mental cruelty.


20. Further, we also rely upon the Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Naveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohli reported in “(2006) 4 SCC 558” wherein it is held as follows:


https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022 “86. In view of the fact that the parties have been living separately for more than 10 years and a very large number of aforementioned criminal and civil proceedings have been initiated by the respondent against the appellant and some proceedings have been initiated by the appellant against the respondent, the matrimonial bond between the parties is beyond repair. A marriage between the parties is only in name. The marriage has been wrecked beyond the hope of salvage, public interest and interest of all concerned lies in the recognition of the fact and to declare defunct de jure what is already defunct de facto. To keep the sham is obviously conducive to immorality and potentially more prejudicial to the public interest than a dissolution of the marriage bond.
87. The High Court ought to have visualised that preservation of such a marriage is totally unworkable which has ceased to be effective and would be greater source of misery for the parties.”
21. The judgments cited by the learned Senior counsel for the appellant/husband and the learned counsel for the respondent/wife also reiterate the same principles except that the decision in those cases, were made on the facts and circumstances obtaining in that case. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022

22. Therefore applying the above principles, we are of the view that the marriage has to be dissolved for the following reasons;

(a) the husband and wife are living separately since 2010.

(b) The allegations made by the wife against the husband and the allegations made by the husband against his wife narrated would suggest that the matrimonial bond is beyond repair.

(c) The appellant has established cruelty for the reasons stated in the earlier part of the Judgment.

(d)The marriage is only on paper and refusal to sever the tie is bound to cause mental cruelty as held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Samar Ghosh v. Jaya Ghosh cited supra.

23. In the result,

(a) C.M.A.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 are allowed.

(b) O.P.No.3476 of 2008 filed by the appellant/husband on the file of V Additional Family Court, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  CMA.Nos.53 and 54 of 2018 & CMP.Nos.722 of 2018 and 20244 of 2022 Chennai seeking a decree and judgment for divorce by dissolving the marriage between the husband and wife is allowed.

(c) O.P.No.976 of 2010 filed by the respondent/wife on the file of V Additional Family Court, Chennai for restitution of conjugal rights is dismissed.

(d) C.M.P.No.20244 of 2022 filed by the respondent/wife seeking permission to let in additional evidence in CMA.No.53 of 2018 is rejected.

                                        (e) The     connected    CMP.No.722        of     2018      in

Srinivasakumar vs State By The Assistant Commissioner Of,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/143771203/,"Madras High Court
Srinivasakumar vs State By The Assistant Commissioner Of ... on 18 July, 2019
1. This Criminal Appeal is filed, against the judgement of conviction and sentence, dated 28.07.2010, made in SC.No. 291 of 2006, by the Mahila Court, Coimbatore, acquitting the Appellant/ accused for the offence under Section 498A of IPC and finding the Appellant/Accused guilty for the offence under Section 306 of IPC and convicting and sentencing the Appellant/Accused for the offence under Section 306 of IPC to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for five years and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/-, in default to undergo six months Rigorous Imprisonment.

2. The case of the Prosecution is that the marriage between the appellant/accused and the deceased, Santha took place on 03.06.2001 at http://www.judis.nic.in Udayar Thimuana Hall, Paramakudi and that at the time of marriage, 40 sovereigns of gold jewels and household articles were given by the parents of the deceased and that thereafter, when they were living at K.K.Pudur, Coimbatore, the appellant/accused, suspecting fidelity of the deceased, had questioned her as to whether she was having a boyfriend and abused her with harsh words and thereby, committed cruelty on her. On 20.02.2006, during night hours, the appellant/accused had abused the deceased in a filthy language and saying her “to go to her parental home immediately or else he will send her out from his house"". On 21.02.2006 around 8.00 a.m., the appellant/accused had abused her, saying her to go and die, due to which, the deceased committed suicide by self immolation by pouring kerosene. Hence, the Appellant/Accused was charge sheeted for the offences under Sections 498A and 306 of IPC.

3. The final report was filed before the learned Judicial Magistrate No.3, Coimbatore in PRC No.13 of 2006. After furnishing copies under Section 207 Cr.PC to the Appellant/Accused, since the case was exclusively triable by a Court of Sessions, the case was committed to the Principal District and Sessions Judge, Coimbatore, who in turn, had made over the case to the Mahila Court, Coimbatore for trial.

4. The Trial Court, after perusing the documents and hearing both sides, had framed necessary charges against the appellant/accused for the offence under Sections 498A and 306 of IPC. The accused had denied the charges and sought for trial. In order to bring home the charges against the accused, on the side of the prosecution PWs.1 to 16 were examined and Exs.P1 to http://www.judis.nic.in P23 and M.Os.1 to 7 were marked.

5. On completion of the evidence on the side of the prosecution, the accused was questioned under Section 313 Cr.PC as to the incriminating circumstances found in the evidence of prosecution witnesses and the accused has come with the version of total denial and stated that he has been falsely implicated in this case. On the side of the defence, D.W.1 was examined and Ex.D.1 was marked.

6. The Trial Court, after hearing the arguments advanced on either side and also looking into the materials available on record, while acquitting the Appellant/Accused for the offence under Section 498A of IPC, found the accused/appellant guilty for the offence under Section 306 of IPC and convicted and sentenced him to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for five years and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/-, in default to undergo six months Rigorous Imprisonment, which is challenged in this Criminal Appeal.

8. The learned counsel for the appellant/accused would submit that the Trial Court, having acquitted the appellant/accused for the offence under Section 498A of IPC on the same set of facts and evidence, erred in convicting the appellant/accused for the offence under Section 306 of IPC. He would submit that the Trial Court had failed to take into consideration that PW.1, father, PW.2, mother and PW.3, brother of the victim/deceased have not supported the case of the prosecution and they have been treated as hostile and that Trial Court erred in believing Ex.P20, dying declaration, despite the fact that the scribe of the complaint one Kaleeswari, the Sub Inspector of Police who http://www.judis.nic.in had recorded the statement of the deceased and one Doctor Sekar, who had attested the same, have not been examined.

9. The learned counsel for the Appellant/Accused would further submit that the other independent witness, PW.4, has also not supported the case of the prosecution and that though Ex.P5, medical certificate was stated to have been recorded in the presence of the Judicial Magistrate and though the duty Doctor was stated to have attested in Ex.P.5, she has not certified that the victim was physically and mentally fit at the time of giving the dying declaration and that when no such certification has been made and the doctor having not been examined, the Trial Court erred in placing reliance on Ex.P5 to base conviction. He would further submit that even assuming that the contents of the dying declaration are taken to be true, the Prosecution did not make out a case for abetment of suicide and that before invoking and raising presumption under Section 113A of the Evidence Act,1872, the prerequisites must be established by the Prosecution

11.The learned counsel for the Appellant/ accused would further submit that though a presumption could be drawn under Section 113A of the Indian Evidence Act, against that Appellant/Accused, the initial burden of proving such an offence has been committed by the appellant/accused under Section 498A IPC is on the prosecution and only on such evidence, the Court may presume that the Appellant/ accused had abetted and further, the presumption under Section 113A of the Indian Evidence Act is not as strict as mandated in Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act. He would further submit that on facts, the Prosecution has not discharged the initial burden http://www.judis.nic.in that the husband had instigated, abetted or intentionally aided so as to drive the wife to commit suicide or that the acts of the appellant were of such a decree which was likely to drive the wife to commit suicide.

12.The learned counsel for the Appellant/Accused would submit that conviction for offence under Section 306 of IPC is not sustainable on the allegation of harassment without there being any positive action of instigation or intentional aid proximate to the time of occurrence on the part of accused, which led or compelled the person to commit suicide. He would rely on the decisions of the Honourable Supreme Court in 2019 SCC Online SC 44 (Rajesh V. State of Haryana) and (2019) 3 SCC 315 (M.Arjunan Vs. State), in support of his contentions.

13.Per Contra, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor would submit that though the parents of the deceased have not supported the case of the prosecution and have turned hostile, Ex.P10, dying declaration given by the deceased and recorded by PW.13, the Judicial Magistrate, in the presence of the duty Doctor, who had certified with regard to the fitness, is clinching and the Trial Court placing reliance on the dying declaration of the victim had rightly convicted the Appellant/ accused. He would further submit that the incident had occurred at 8.00 a.m., on 21.02.2006, and the dying declaration was recorded at 9.50 a.m., on the same day within one hour and that the victim had specifically stated that her husband suspected her fidelity and that after consuming liquor, he used to beat her and that on the previous day, he had consumed liquor and had beaten her and even in the morning, prior to the occurrence the appellant/accused had created a problem with the http://www.judis.nic.in victim/deceased and thereby, she being fed up with her life had gone into the bathroom and committed suicide by self immolating herself. He would further submit that Ex.P5 is the Certificate of Fitness issued by Dr.Sangeetha, certifying that the victim was conscious and was in a fit state of mind when the dying declaration was recorded by PW.13, Judicial Magistrate. Subsequently, a statement had been recorded by the Sub Inspector of Police, Kaleeswari, in the presence of Dr.Sangeetha. Even eschewing all other statements, Ex.P10, the dying declaration recorded by PW.13, Judicial Magistrate, is clinching and there is no reason to disbelieve it. There is no contradiction between the statements recorded from the deceased and there is no reason or circumstance giving rise to any suspicion about its truthfulness. He would further submit that the Trial Court, raising presumption against the appellant/accused under Section 113A of the Evidence Act and accepting the dying declaration as the statement made under Section 32 of the Evidence Act, has rightly convicted the appellant/accused and that though the parents of the deceased have turned hostile before the Court, the Trial Court, placing reliance on the dying declaration of the victim and other corroborative evidence through independent witness, had rightly convicted the appellant/accused.

14.The learned Additional Public Prosecutor would submit that the statements have been recorded during RDO Enquiry wherein the father, mother and brother of the victim/deceased have stated in detail with regard to the harassment, meted out to the victim deceased and that immediately after the occurrence, a statement has been recorded by Kalaimani, the Sub Inspector http://www.judis.nic.in of Police in the presence of Dr.Sangeetha, who has certified about the consciousness of the patient while the statement was recorded, wherein the victim had vividly stated about the harassment inflicted on her by the appellant/accused.

15.At this juncture, the learned counsel for the appellant/ accused would submit that the statements recorded, during the enquiry by the Revenue Divisional Officer can only be construed as statements recorded during the enquiry/investigation and that the close relatives have not supported the case of the prosecution in the witness box during the trial and thereby the statements made before the RDO cannot be taken into consideration and they have to be brushed aside. He would further submit that the Trial Court ought to have taken into consideration the attended circumstances in the case and that the presumptions against the appellant/accused under Section 113A of the Evidence Act having not been proved, ought to have acquitted the Appellant. He would also submit that as per the Accident Register, Ex.P6, the deceased was stated to have sustained 100% burn injuries, which were II to III degree burns and it would not have been possible to give a dying declaration. Further, the conduct of the Appellant/Accused immediately after the occurrence would infer that it was not the intention of the appellant/accused to drive the victim to commit suicide and that it could be inferred from the facts that immediately after the occurrence he had attempted to save his wife, due to which he had sustained grievous injuries and was admitted as an inpatient and the treatment taken by him in the hospital has been spoken to by PW.15, Investigating Officer and these facts http://www.judis.nic.in improbabilise the theory of the appellant having abetted suicide. In support of the above contentions, the learned counsel for the appellant/accused would rely on the judgement reported in (2001) 9 SCC 618 Ramesh Kumar V. State of Chhattisgarh.

17.The Trial Court, in and by the impugned judgement, while acquitting the Appellant/Accused for the offence under Section 498A of IPC, had found the Appellant/Accused guilty and sentenced him for the offence under Section 306 of IPC, as stated above, holding that the Prosecution, by cogent evidence, had proved that the Appellants/ accused had committed acts of incitement to the commission of suicide by the deceased.

18.Now, the Points for consideration is as to whether the Trial Court is justified in convicting Appellant/Accused for the offence under Section Section 306 of IPC despite the fact that the relatives of the victim/deceased turning hostile and having not supported the case of the Prosecution and there being multiple statements recorded from the deceased.

19.In this context, while analysing the entire evidence, PW.1, Nithyanandham, a retired Government Servant, PW.2, Indirani and PW.3, Sivasankaran, PW.4, Mayadevi, are respectively the father, mother and brother and a neighbour, of the deceased and they have not supported the case of the Prosecution and they have been treated as hostile.

21.PW.9 , Dr.Sekar, is the Chief Medical Officer, K.G.Hospital, Coimbatore, who had examined the victim/deceased and had spoken to about the treatment given on 21.02.2006, at 8.55 a.m. to the victim/deceased, who was admitted in the hospital for taking treatment for burn injuries. He had deposed that the victim/ deceased had sustained severe burn injuries all over the body and at that time Dr.Sangeetha, was on duty in the out patient ward and that an intimation under Ex.P4 was given to the Judicial Magistrate for recording the dying declaration of the victim/deceased and that based on the intimation, the learned Magistrate had visited the hospital and had recorded the dying declaration and that Dr.Sangeetha, Duty Doctor, had certified with regard to the fitness of the victim/deceased and the portion of the certificate of fitness was marked as Ex.P5 and that the victim/deceased had been taking treatment till 04.03.2006 and that she had died on 04.03.2006 at 12.40 p.m and the medical documents related to the medical http://www.judis.nic.in history was marked as Ex.P6 and during cross examination, he had deposed that there are corrections with regard to the date and time in respect of Ex.P6 (Accident Register).

22.PW.10, Dr.Kulandaivelu, who had conducted autopsy on the body of the victim/deceased, had deposed that on 05.03.2006, on the request of the District Revenue Officer sent through Woman Police Constable, Jayalakshmi, he had conducted autopsy on the body of the deceased and he had given an opinion that the victim/deceased died of ""extensive burns and its complications” and that viscera does not contain any poison and that the post-mortem report was marked as Ex.P7 and the chemical analysis report was marked as Ex.P8 and the finding of the doctor opinion was marked as Ex.P9.

24.PW.12, Jayalakshmi, the Police constable had deposed that she had taken the body of the deceased for post-mortem and after completing post-mortem, she handed over the body of the deceased to the relatives of the victim/deceased.

29.On the side of the defence, one Dr.B.Balasubramaniam was examined as DW.1 and the case sheet was marked as Ex.D1. He had deposed that as per Ex.D1, the victim/deceased had been administered with pain killers namely pethidine, at 10.30 a.m. and it had been noted in the case sheet.

32.Another point raised by the learned counsel for the Appellant/ accused is that yet another statement was recorded by one Kaleeswari, which had been marked as Ex.P20, based on which the First Information Report was registered. The learned counsel for the Appellant/Accused has argued that there were inconsistencies in the dying declaration. As stated above, when there are more than one dying declaration, the Law is that if the dying declaration is true and made voluntarily by the deceased, conviction can be based solely on it without any further corroboration and it is neither a rule of law nor or prudence that a dying declaration cannot be relied upon without corroboration.

33.The Court has to scrutinise the dying declaration carefully and must ensure that the dying declaration is not result of tutoring, prompting or imagination. This Court has carefully gone through the dying declarations. The dying declaration under Ex.P10 has been recorded by a Judicial Magistrate, which would stand on much higher footing than the dying declaration recorded by an officer of lower rank. Subsequently, a statement had been recorded by the Sub Inspector of Police, Kaleeswari, which had been marked as Ex.P20. Even eschewing Ex.P20, the dying declaration recorded by the Judicial http://www.judis.nic.in Magistrate, inspires confidence

34.However, strangely, in this case, all the relatives of the victim/deceased, PW.1 to PW.3, father, mother and brother of the deceased, respectively and PW.7 and PW.8, cousin and maternal grand father of the deceased, have not supported the case of the prosecution and they have been treated as hostile by the prosecution.

37.In Ex.P10, it was recorded to the effect that the deceased was in a fit state of mind at the time recording dying declaration and that after understanding the http://www.judis.nic.in contents of the same, she affixed her left big toe impression on the same and that duty Doctor was also there at that time. Even in Ex.P20, the deceased had stated that the Appellant, suspecting her fidelity, was abusing her in a filthy language frequently and that he shouted against the deceased, saying that she should go to her parents house and had beaten her.

46.In the result, this Criminal Appeal is partly allowed. The impugned judgement of conviction and sentence for the offence under Section 306 of IPC is confirmed. However, considering the above said mitigating circumstances, while confirming the imposition of fine amount, with default sentence, the sentence of Rigorous Imprisonment is modified to the period of one year Rigorous Imprisonment. Since it is reported that the appellant/accused is on bail, the Respondent Police police is directed to secure the presence of the appellant/accused to undergo the period of sentence now imposed.

                                       ORAL ORDER

9   07-01-2025
Heard Mr. Rajendra Narayan, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner and Mr. Chandra Bhushan Prasad, learned APP appearing for the State.

2. The instant petition has been filed against the order dated 19.04.2017 passed by the court of learned A.C.J.M. 1 st, Bettiah, West Champaran, in connection with Bettiah (Mufasil) P.S. Case No. 12 of 2017, whereby the cognizance of the offences punishable under sections 307, 313, 498A, 341, 342 and 504 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (in short 'IPC') and sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act (in short 'D.P. Act') has been taken against the petitioner.

3. The main grounds taken by learned senior counsel Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.53915 of 2017(9) dt.07-01-2025 appearing for the petitioner to assail the order impugned are that the prosecution story with regard to the allegation which is said to have taken place on 15.01.2017 as per the FIR, is completely unbelievable as much earlier from that date, in between the petitioner and the informant, the matrimonial relation had deteriorated and initially, the petitioner filed a Matrimonial Case No. 25 of 2016 under section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act for the restitution of conjugal rights which was later withdrawn and thereafter, the petitioner filed a matrimonial suit for divorce on 07.09.2016 and in that case, the notices were sent to the O.P. No. 2 but she did not appear and also in the present matter, she has not appeared despite the notices have been served upon her. During the investigation, it has come into light that the O.P. No. 2 never visited at her sasural on 15.01.2017, the date relating to the main occurrence which is said to have taken place in the matrimonial house of the O.P. No. 2 and the statements of the material witnesses mentioned in the paragraph Nos. 8, 9 and 10 of the case diary were not appreciated by the learned Magistrate while differing with the police conclusion which was in favour of the petitioner and secondly, the co-accused persons, namely, Madhu Kumari @ Madhu Devi and Puja Kumari @ Puja Devi, though they are said to be the in-laws of the O.P. No. 2 but carrying the same nature of allegation preferred criminal miscellaneous No. Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.53915 of 2017(9) dt.07-01-2025 23673/2017 with a prayer to quash the cognizance order relating to them and their prayer was allowed vide Judgment dated 09.12.2019 passed in the said criminal miscellaneous petition, and if the allegations levelled in the FIR are taken into account then no case is made out to differentiate between the allegations levelled against the petitioner and the allegations levelled against the in- laws, so, when the co-accused persons carrying similar allegations have been exonerated from the criminal liability then why should the petitioner face the same liability and further, the order impugned dated 19.04.2017 by which the cognizance of the alleged offences has been taken in itself shows the non-application of judicial mind by the learned Magistrate as he simply mentioned that the case diary provided sufficient materials to make out a prima facie case but did not take any pain to mention the said materials and the order impugned clearly shows that the Magistrate while taking cognizance mainly took into account the materials available in the case diary.

4. On the other hand, learned APP for the State has vehemently opposed this petition and submitted that the judgment dated 09.12.2019 passed in Cr. Misc. No. 23673/2017 by which the relief has been granted to the in-laws should not be made a ground while granting the relief to the petitioner as then learned co-ordinate Bench of this Court while granting the relief to the Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.53915 of 2017(9) dt.07-01-2025 said co-accused persons mainly took into account the relationship between the co-accused persons and the O.P. No. 2 while the petitioner is said to be the husband of the O.P. No. 2 and he was mainly responsible for all the alleged acts which are alleged to have been committed with the O.P. No. 2.

5. Heard both the sides and perused the order impugned, case diary and other relevant materials. As per the FIR, the marriage in between the petitioner and the O.P. No. 2 took place in the year 2012 and as per the above submissions, the relation between the O.P. No. 2 and the petitioner started deteriorating after their marriage and they started living separately and the O.P. No. 2 chose to reside in Delhi owing to her job and during that course, the petitioner firstly preferred a matrimonial suit for the relief of restitution of his conjugal rights and thereafter, filed a matrimonial suit for dissolving the matrimonial relation and in that case, the O.P. No. 2 did not appear as per above submission and in the present matter also, she has not chosen to contest and in the case diary, some witnesses who can be deemed to be the material persons with regard to the main alleged occurrence which is said to have taken place on 15.01.2017, stated that the O.P. No. 2 did not visit at her matrimonial house on the said date, though the allegations levelled in the FIR as well as in the restatement by the informant Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.53915 of 2017(9) dt.07-01-2025 and her father in the paragraph No. 5 of the case diary are relevant to some extent to the alleged offences but the learned Magistrate passed the order impugned without appreciating even prima facie the materials available in the case diary which is not proper and not in accordance with settled principle of law as a Magistrate is required to give some satisfactory reasons, though in brief manner to justify his conclusion as to differing with the police report but in this matter, it appears that the order impugned has been passed in mechanical manner without giving any reason while disbelieving the police conclusion, so, the order impugned is not sustainable in the eye of law, thus, it stands set aside and the learned Magistrate is directed to pass a fresh order on the point of the cognizance in accordance with law keeping in view the materials available in the case diary and the facts mentioned in the protest petition preferred by the O.P. No. 2, without being prejudiced with this order.

6. In the result, the instant petition stands allowed with the aforesaid direction.

2. In briefly the case of the prosecution is as follows:-

It is the case of the prosecution that, the accused no.1 who has married to C.W.1 by name Dr.C.S.Chaitra on 02.06.2010 as per Hindu rites and customs prevailed under Hindu Community at Venkatadri Samudaya Bhavan, Hassan district, at the time of marriage the accused No.1 to 3 with an intention to commit an offence and in furtherance of their common intention demanded dowry and received Ford car, one gold bracelet, one gold finger ring, one gold chain, clothes and cash of Rs.1,00,000/-from the parents of C.W.1 in the form of dowry. After marriage C.W.1 was staying with the accused no.1 at her matrimonial house, Bengaluru, by that time the accused no.1 subjected physcial and mental cruelty to C.W.1 and forcibly took away her ATM Card and demanded additional dowry. Further on 10.03.2011 at about 6.30P.M, the accused no.1 to 3 in an inebriated state insisted C.W.1 to leave her doctor profession and to go with them to Mysore and abused C.W1 in filthy language and threatened to kill her by hanging and setting her ablaze by pouring kerosene on her if she did not go to Mysore with them and criminally intimidated to do away with the life of C.W1 and therefore the C.W.1 lodged the complaint against accused No.1 to 3 before the Mahalakshmi Layout Police seeking necessary action against them in accordance with law.
C.C.32426/2011
3. On the basis of the said complaint given by C.W.1, the complainant police have registered the case under Crime No.82/2011 and sent FIR to this Court and to their concerned higher authorities. Thereafter, the complainant police have visited the spot and conducted the spot mahazar in the presence of the panch witnesses, herein after recorded the statements of witnesses who availed in the station subsequently who availed where the said mahazars have been drawn, after completion of the investigation the IO has arived at a conclusion that there are sufficient materials as to prosecute the accused No.1 to 3 , for which charge sheet has been filed for the above said offences.

4. After filing of the charge sheet, this Court registered the case is as numbered above, before that the accused persons surrendered before court and were enlarged on bail, meanwhile copies of the charge sheet and other prosecution papers were duly supplied as required under Section 207 of Cr.P.C. After hearing both sides, this court found that there were sufficient reasons so as to frame charge against the accused No.1 to 3 , therefore charge has been framed and read over and explained to the accused No.1 to 3 in the language known to them, after understanding they denied the same and claimed to be tried, accordingly, proceeded with trial.

5. In order to prove its case, the prosecution has examined six witnesses who are said to be complainant, eye witnesses, mahazar witnesses, circumstantial witnesses as well as the investigating agency at P.W.1 to 6 and got marked documents at Ex.P-1 to P.13, during the period of prosecution evidence.

4. Mariyam Anto Bruno Vs- Police Inspector, dated 12.10.2022.
7. In view of above said facts and circumstances the following points that would arise for my consideration are as follows:-

POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION
1. Whether the prosecution proves beyond all reasonable doubt that the marriage of the accused No.1 was solemnized with C.W.1 on 02.06.2010 at Hassan as per Hindu rites and customs and after marriage while C.W.1 was staying with the accused no.1 to 3 at the matrimonial house, during that time the accused no.1 to 3 who have colluded with each other and in furtherance of their common intention subjected the C.W.1 to physical and mental cruelty continously by demanding additional dowry and thereby the accused No.1 to 3 have committed an offence punishable under section 498A r/w Sec. 34 of IPC?

6. What Order?

8. My answers to the above points are as under:

Point Nos.1 to 5 : In the 'Negative' Point No.6 : As per the final order, for the following:-
REASONS
9. Point No.1 to 5 : These points are taken up together for common discussion in order to avoid the repetation of facts.

10. In order to prove its case, the prosecution has examined in total 06 witnesses out of 18 charge sheet witnesses. Among them C.W.2, 3, 6, 10 to 12 are ordered to be dropped. C.W.8 and 9 are given up, rest of the witnesses were not examined in this case. Apart from these things the prosecution has got exihibited documents at Ex.P.1 to 13, so that upon considering these oral and documentary testimonials here there is no doubt that since the C.W.1 and accused No.1 being husband and wife and their marriage was solemnized on 02.06.2010, this aspect even admitted by the accused persons. Here it is relevant to mention that it has to be known whether before marriage and after the marriage the above said accused persons have subjected the C.W.1 to physical and mental cruelty and demanded additional dowry. In this regard the prosecution has made its best efforts so as to bring home the guilt of the accused persons to the said allegations among firstly the C.W.1/P.W.1- Chaitra.C.S deposed in her evidence that she is working as Medical Officer at ESI Hospital and she got marriage proposal of the accused No.1 from Adichunchanagiri Mutt and she was told that accused No.1 was doing M.D in InterMedicine at Philadelphia and accused no.2 was a retd.Executive Engineer and were residents of Mysuru and engagement C.C.32426/2011 of accused No.1 and C.W1 took place on 12.03.2010 at Channarayapatna and marriage was fixed on 02.02.2010 and during marriage talks took place at the farm house of one Rajan at Mysore and accused No.1 to 3 demanded one gold bracelet, gold chain, one ring, cash of Rs.1,00,000/- for clothes and a Ford Figo car.

11. Further P.W.1 deposed that her father agreed to the demand made by accused and accused No.2 received the cash and accused No.1 received the gold ornaments in the presence of her parents and one Rajan and marriage was performed on 02.06.2010 at Venkatadri Kalyanmantapa at Hassan by spending 10 lakhs. P.W.1 deposed that she came to know that accused no.2 was working as driver at KSFC and accused had not arranged for a house at Bengaluru and as such father of C.W.1 gave Rs.75,000/- as advance to set up the house and the accused persons made galata on the day of the marriage and gave earrings of 02 grams only and did not give any gold bangles and accused no.1 took away Rs.50,000/- given to C.W.1 by her father and fought with C.W.1 at the ATM and damaged the car by banging it to an autorickshaw. Further she deposed that the accused No.1 used to quarrel with her and she did not know where accused No.1 was working and accused No.1 told C.W.1 that he lost his job in the month of July and since then the accused No.1 did not go to any work and was consuming alcohol, accused would not go home regularly and sometimes accused No.1 would go out of the house during night times and would get his friends to the house and insisted C.W.1 to cook for them. The accused No.1 insisted C.W.1 to leave her job, the accused persons forced C.W.1 to pay the loan taken by accused No.1 to study BDS and accused persons demanded C.W.1 to get Rs.15 lakhs from her father and made galata with C.W.1 and when C.C.32426/2011 C.W.1 had come to Mysuru with the accused No.1, the accused no.2 took away the golden ornaments from C.W.1 and demanded C.W.1 to get dowry and harassed C.W.1 and the accused no.1 left the house and went away. She further deposed that panchayath was convened and the accused persons imposed conditions that CW.1 should not talk to her parents, she should disclose her income and she should do all the household work on her own and that she should not question the accused No.1 even if he consumes alcohol and the accused No.1 had received Rs.2,00,000 from the father of C.W.1. Further she deposed that on 10.03.2011 at about 6.30 P.M the accused No.1 was in an inebriated condition and accused No.1 strangulated the neck of C.W.1 with a dupatta and accused No.2 and 3 held her hand tightly and on hearing her scream the owner of the house came to the house and rescued her and the accused No.1 to 3 took away the laptop, gold ornaments of C.W.1 and went away from the house and the C.W1 lodged complaint on 11.03.2011 and on the same day police drew spot mahazar and later the accused persons threatened C.W.1 to withdraw the case and hence the C.W.1 filed a petition for divorce.

12. Likewise P.W.2 who is none other than the father of C.W.1 also deposed the facts about the marriage and exchange of dowry. Another witness by name Vijaykumar who is said to be neighbor and the owner of the house of C.W.1 deposed that one fine day the C.W.1 screamed loudly and rushed to his house seeking help, immediately he went to the said spot where he saw that the accused no.1 holding dupatta in his hand. P.W.3 by name Manjegowda S/o.Puttaswamy Gowda examined in this case and most of the things were deposed about the performance of marriage and handing over of things in the form of dowry. Here it is C.C.32426/2011 taken into note that according to case of prosecution the accused No.1 has tried to assault on 10.03.2011 at about 6.30P.M before the presence of accused No.2 and 3. But in the entire prosecution case PW.1 herself clearly admitted that the accused No.2 and 3 were not in the place of crime as such the evidence of PW.2 to 4 as they were saying that the accused persons who have committed these offences cannot be accepted. Further on taking into consideration of these oral and documentary testimonials and existence of those things firstly this court on looking into the cross examination of these witnesses in relation to dowry in which the P.W1 itself clearly deposed is as below ಫೋರ್ಡ್‍ ಕಾರು ನನ್ನ ಹೆಸರಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಖರೀದಿಸಿದ್ದ ರು ಏಕೆಂದರೆ ರೋಡ್‍ ಟ್ಯಾ ಕ್ಸ್ ಎಕ್ಸ್ಮೆಂಷನ್‍ ಸಿಗುತ್ತ ದೆ ಎಂದು ನನ್ನ ಹೆಸರಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಖರೀದಿಸಿದೆ. ಆ ಕಾರು ನನ್ನ ಸ್ವಾ ಧೀನದಲ್ಲಿ ಇದೆ. ಮಾತು-ಕತೆಯ ಸಮಯದಲ್ಲಿ 30 ಗ್ರಾಂ ಬ್ರ್ಯಾ ಸ್ಲೆ ಟ್‍, 15ಗ್ರಾಂ ಉಂಗುರ, 15 ಗ್ರಾಂ ಚಿನ್ನ ದ ಸರ, ಮತ್ತು 1ಲಕ್ಷ ರೂ ನಗದು ಹಣ ಉಡುಪು ಮತ್ತು ಉಡುಗೆಗೊಸ್ಕ ರ ಕೇಳಿದರು ಎಂದು ಯಾರು ತೀಸಿದರು ಎಂದರೆ ನಮ್ಮ ಕುಟುಂಬದವರು ತಿಳಿಸಿದರು, ಮೇಲಿನ ವಸ್ತು ಗಳನ್ನು ನಾನು ಖುದ್ದಾ ಗಿ ನೋಡಿಲ್ಲ ನನ್ನ ತಂದೆ ತಿಳಿಸಿದರು.

ಚಿನ್ನ ದ ಓಲೆಗಳನ್ನು ನನಗೆ ಕೊಡುವುದಾಗಿ ಆರೋಪಿತರು ಈ ವಿಷಯವನ್ನು ನನಗೆ ತಿಳಿಸಿದರು.

ದಿಃ 10.03.2011 ರಂದು ಆರೋಪಿ ನನ್ನ ದುಪ್ಪ ಟ್ಟಾ ದಿಂದ ಕುತ್ತಿ ಗೆಗೆ ಸುತ್ತಿ ಸಾಯಿಸುವುದಾಗಿ ಬೆದರಿಕೆ ಹಾಕಿದರು. ಆ ಸಮಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಆರೋಪಿ ಹಾಗೂ ಅವರ ತಂದೆ-ತಾಯಿ ಹಾಗೂ 3 ಆರೋಪಿ ಹಾಜರು ಇದ್ದ್ರರು.

ಗಲಾಟೆಯಾದ ಸಮಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಎಷ್ಟು ಜನ ಸೇರಿದ್ದ ರು ಎಂದರೆ ಘಟನೆಯಾದಾಗ ನಾನು ಪ್ರ ಜ್ಞೆ ತಪ್ಪಿ ದ್ದು ಇದೆ ಆದರೆ ಮನೆಯ ಮಾಲೀಕರು ಅವರ ಮನೆಗೆ ನನ್ನ ನ್ನು ಕರೆದುಕೊಂಡು C.C.32426/2011 ಹೋಗಿದ್ದು ಇದೆ.

By considering these oral testimonials and contents of Ex.P.4, 5 and 6 in which it clearly discloses that there is no specific date in Ex.P.4 and 5, but according to Ex.P.6 this bill has been raised on 20.05.2011 in favor of Swamy Gowda by SRS Jewellers, Hassan who is none other than father of P.W.1. Here it is taken into note that marriage was solemnized on 02.06.2010, but above said bill has been raised after the marriage. Considering these aspects here it is clearly proves that after lapse of nearly one year these alleged bills have been raised, therefore whatever plea which urged in the complaint as well in the deposition of P.W.1 to 4 so far as handing over the dowry description which made is as above raises suspicious circumstances that those articles have been purchased after the marriage but not before the marriage. However demanding of dowry and handing over of same to the accused No.1 before the marriage does not arise for consideration for the reason behind according to the photographs that one suit and finger rings were exchanged as customary gifts, but it cannot be considered as dowry. As far as working status of the accused No.1 and his father as driver in the KSFC and made mischief before the marriage about the accused no.1, those cannot be considered in the case on hand, because the complaint itself speaks about dowry harassment as to which once again on looking into the oral and documentary testimonials about the demand of additional dowry after the marriage is concerned no such believable and cogent materials are available in the case on hand, as to accept that the accused persons have demanded additional dowry. On focussing these things the prosecution ought to prove its case without any doubt and it is paramount duty of the prosecution to discharge the doubt arising in its case. In such scenario on going through the deposition of C.C.32426/2011 witnesses among as far as deposition of P.W.1 in M.C.4094/2011 and M.C No.1066/2013 she clearly admitted that one gold ring was given to accused No.1 during the engagement, remaining gold ornaments were given at time of marriage. In order to prove that aspect here she has completely failed to justify to the extent as to what kind of gold ornaments were given to the accused No.1 at the time of marriage and how much amount was given to the father of accused No.1. In this regard the P.W.1 clearly deposed in her evidence that she does not know about the description of those alleged gold ornaments and when and where they were handed over to accused No.1.

13. The P.W.2-Swamy Gowda deposed that there was marriage proposal and during that time the accused no.1 and his parents who were demanded one Ford Figo car, gold chain, finger ring, bracelet in the form of dowry but he has also not sure whether those were handed over or not and on what date and where those were handed over to the accused no.1 or his parents. Under such circumstances here there are no any prima facie materials so as to believe that the accused persons received the gold ornaments at the time of marriage. In fact the C.W.2 and one by name C.W.9/Rajan who said to be sole eye witnesses to the alleged incident have not been brought before the court for tendering their evidence. Apart from all these reasons here the accused counsel has vehemently argued that basically the C.W.1 not known how to prepare food and before marriage she did not like the marriage proposal of the accused no.1, even if due to the compulsion of her parents she agreed to the said proposal, after the marriage she created false and cooked story with an intention to get divorce from the accused and come out from the matrimonial house even though the C.C.32426/2011 accused No.1 discharging his duty as dutiful husband. In support of which he has pointed out that the P.W.1 has deposed the same thing in her evidence in M.C petition, same reads as below:

it is true that my husband has filed M.C.1066/2013 on the file of this court against me seeking restitution of conjugal rights. It is true that the said M.C.No.1066/2013 was earlier in the family Court at Mysuru in M.C.No.175/2011 and transferred to this court. It is false that after filing of petition by my husband for restitution of conjugal rights I have filed divorce petition apprehending decree to be passed against me in a case filed by husband. I am not ready to rejoin my husband even though he is ready to take me back""
On account of these facts one thing clearly establishes that firstly the prosecution has failed to establish its case about the exchange of dowry in between the accused and parents of C.W.1 as specified in the charge sheet. Secondly, it is the duty of the prosecution to prove whether the accused persons subjected C.W1 to physical and mental cruelty only on the ground to bring additional sdowry from the parental house of C.W.1. Finally on looking into the prosecution papers which got exihibited at Ex.P.1 to P.13 and evidence of investigating agency who have been examined at P.W.5 and 6 in which the investigating agency has failed to discover the thing that whether the accused persons have definitely committed these offences on the ground of demanding additional dowry. Here according to the case of prosecution the accused persons have harassed the C.W.1 on 10.03.2011 and tried to strangulate the neck of C.W.1 with a dupatta, but said alleged dupatta has not been C.C.32426/2011 seized in the place of alleged crime. Further the P.W.1 in her evidence clearly deposed that the landlord and his wife came to her rescue in the said house, in another version she deposed that herself went to the house of the landlord. All these factual aspects creates so many discrepancies and caused ommissions on part of the investigation agency, That apart as on that date the accused No.2 and 3 were not appeared in the place of crime. Under such circumstances here alleged assault cannot be accepted because mainly the investigating agency has failed to collect any cogent and reliable materials so as to believe that the accused persons have committed these alleged offences as to the reason as per Ex.P.11 -wound certificate the C.W.1 appears to be sustained injuries on her body, but the medical practitioner who issued that wound certificate has not been examined, likewise mahazar witnesses and such other direct witnesses have not been brought before the court as to the reasons best known to the concerned police, therefore as on the date of alleged crime directly and impliedly she has not been sustained any injuries as mentioned in the wound certificate. Therefore merely on the ground of registering of FIR, recording of statement, drawing of mahazar would not discharge their duty as responsible investigation officers. By virtue of all these reasons the prosecution has not established the ingredients of the alleged offences against the accused No.1 to 3 however herein no positive evidence to prove the guilt of the accused No.1 to 3, for which this Court is of the considered opinion that prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of the accused No.1 to 3 beyond all reasonable doubts and whatever the ratio laiod down in the foregoing decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court are not aptly applicable to the case on hand, due to the facts and circumstances C.C.32426/2011 are discussed in the foregoing decisions are different than the case on hand. Hence, benefit of doubt goes to the accused No.1 to 3, for which I answer point Nos.1 to 5 in the 'Negative'.
14. Point No.6: In view of my findings on point Nos.1 to 5 and reasons assigned therein, I proceed to pass the following:

ORDER Acting under Section 248(1) of Cr.P.C., the accused No.1 to 3 are not found guilty and they are hereby acquitted of the offences punishable under Secs.498A, 504, 506 r/w Sec.34 of IPC and Sec.3 and 4 of D.P.Act.
The bail bond executed by the accused No.1 to 3 stands cancelled.
In compliance of section 437-A of Cr.P.C. the bail bond executed by the accused No.1 to 3 are ordered to be continued in force for six months or till issuance of notice in respect of any appeal [if preferred] against the present Judgment before the Appellate Court.

Anand P.K.V vs Sulabha Devi C.C on 7 January, 2025
Sathish Ninan, J.

The original petition filed by the husband, seeking dissolution of marriage, was dismissed by the Family Court. He is in appeal.

2. The marriage between the parties were solemnised on 22.04.2001. The marital relationship got strained and they have been living separately since 29.08.2002. A girl child was born in the wedlock on 27.05.2002. The grounds on which divorce is sought are, cruelty and desertion.

3. The Family Court held that the ground urged has not been proved and accordingly, dismissed the original petition.

2025:KER:595

4. We have heard Shri.Abhilash K.N., the learned counsel on behalf of the appellant-husband and Shri.P.M. Unni Namboodiri, the learned counsel for the respondent- wife.

5. At the time of marriage, the husband was working as an Attender in ITI, Kannur and the respondent-wife was a Government U.P. School teacher. According to the husband, the wife was compelling him to have a separate residence independent of his parents. They were residing along with his aged mother and unmarried brother. He found it difficult to agree for the wife's demand. According to the husband, though the wife got admission for B.Ed course in an institution, which was closer to the matrimonial home, she insisted to live at her parental house.

6. According to the wife, the husband had, prior to the marriage, represented that he is an Instructor in 2025:KER:595 the ITI and after the marriage it was realised that he was only an Attender. The husband, while denying the same, claimed that the wife was always picking up quarrels with him and used to ridicule him in the presence of others.

7. The fact that the husband and wife lived together only for a short duration, is borne out by the evidence. The plea of the wife is that she was cheated by the husband with regard to his avocation and she realised it after marriage. If that allegation is true that must have sparked the discord between the two. It is probable that the wife was reluctant to live with him. Admittedly they lived together only for a very short duration. The wife had gone to her parental house admittedly, for the reason of studies or otherwise.

8. Earlier, the husband had filed an original petition for dissolution of marriage as O.P.No.962 of 2025:KER:595 2009. The wife had filed a criminal case against the husband under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. Pending the proceedings, there was a compromise. Based upon the same, the husband withdrew the original petition. However, the wife did not withdraw the criminal proceedings. Though an attempt was made by him to get the original petition restored, it was unsuccessful. It is thereafter that the present original petition was filed. Apart from the cruelty of keeping away from the company and living separately, this amounts to further mental cruelty, it alleged.

9. The fact that there was an attempted compromise pursuant to which the husband withdrew the earlier original petition is not in dispute. Admittedly, atleast since 2002, the parties are living separately. Evidently, there has been irretrievable break down in the relationship. The instances as noticed supra would 2025:KER:595 amount to mental cruelty. In Samar Ghosh v. Jaya Ghosh [(2007) 4 SCC], the Apex Court has laid down illustrative cases where inference of ""mental cruelty"" can be drawn. The Apex Court further held that where there has been a long period of continuous separation, it may fairly be concluded that the matrimonial bond is beyond repair. The marriage becomes a fiction though supported by a legal tie. By refusing to sever that tie, the law in such cases, does not serve the sanctity of marriage; on the contrary, it shows scant regard for the feelings and emotions of the parties. In such like situations, it may lead to mental cruelty.

10. In K. Srinivas Rao v. D.A. Deepa [(2013) 5 SCC 226] , the Apex Court took note of the unbridgeable distance between spouses and the consequent irretrievable breakdown of marriage to order separation. The above was followed by this court in Geetha S. v. Pradeep G. [2024 (4) KLT 2025:KER:595 527] and Sivadasan v. Prabha [2017 SCC OnLine Ker. 31219] . We are of the opinion that this is a fit case where the marriage between the parties is liable to be dissolved.

11. During the course of hearing the appeal, it was brought to the notice of this Court that execution petition is pending before the Family Court, Thalassery with regard to arrears of maintenance/educational expenses of the child. Today, when the matter was taken up, the appellant-husband paid an amount of Rs.1,57,600/- to the counsel for the respondent-wife towards the amount due under the execution petition. A joint memo has been filed with regard to the receipt of the said amount in full and final satisfaction of the claim under execution petition. It is undertaken before this Court that the husband shall pay a further amount of Rs.50,000/- within one month from today towards educational expenses of the child. It is further 2025:KER:595 undertaken that the husband shall also share the marriage expenses of the child. The undertaking is recorded.

Resultantly, the appeal is allowed. The judgment and decree of the Family Court are set aside. The original petition is allowed granting a decree of dissolution of the marriage solemnised between the parties on 22.04.2001.

On the same day, the defacto complainant, who is the father of the deceased, gave a complaint stating that his son received information at about 10.45 a.m that his sister Gokila was admitted at Chinnamanur Government Hospital after consuming poison and declared dead. The defacto complainant along with his sons and wife went to the hospital and saw the deceased. The defacto complainant, thereafter, at about 12.30 hours gave a complaint to the respondent police stating that he suspected the involvement of his son-in-law, mother and the sister of his son-in-law in the death of his daughter. The respondent police registered FIR in Crime No.339 of 2014 under Section 306 IPC. Thereafter, pursuant to the investigation, the charge sheet was filed against the petitioners for the offences under Sections 306 and 498A IPC.

3.This Court at the time of admission in Crl.O.P(MD)No.3572 of 2019, had granted interim stay of the proceedings, by the order dated 07.03.2017.

Therefore, the case is still pending at the committal stage.

4.Mr.G.Karuppasamy Pandiyan, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submitted that the impugned charge sheet is liable to be quashed as the allegations made in the charge sheet do not constitute the offences of Sections 306 or 498A IPC. The F.I.R lodged by the second respondent does not refer to any dowry harassment or ill-treatment allegedly committed by the petitioners. The allegations of dowry demand besides being vague is an after thought. Even according to the defacto complainant, the deceased did not speak to him for more than 3½ years. Neither the defacto complainant nor the other witnesses examined on the side of the prosecution have spelt out as to when and what was the nature of the dowry demand. The learned counsel further submitted that the deceased died 7 years after the marriage and the presumption under Section 113(a) of the Evidence Act is also not available for the prosecution in the instant case. The prosecution had not taken steps to conduct R.D.O. enquiry to ascertain whether there was any dowry demand. No proof has been given other than the vague allegations to implicate the petitioners. The learned counsel further submitted that tendency to false implication can be seen from the fact that the sister in law, who was residing far away from the matrimonial home, has been unnecessarily implicated. The mother in law who is an old lady, was also sought to be implicated. The learned counsel relied upon the Judgment of this Court reported in (2021)2 MLJ (Crl) https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  Crl.O.P.(MD).Nos.3572 of 2019 and 10021 of 2021 610 (Mala @ Manimala vs. State) and another unreported Judgment of this Court made in Crl.O.P.No.13628 of 2014 dated 05.08.2014 (Sarojini vs. State), in support of his submission.

5.The learned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that the allegation of dowry demand is found in the statement of the witnesses examined during investigation and from the inquest report. Merely because RDO enquiry was not conducted, the prosecution case cannot be said to be false. The investigation has independently collected evidence and found that the deceased was subjected to cruelty and she had committed suicide on account of the said cruelty.

6.Though notice was served on the defacto complainant, none has entered appearance on behalf of the defacto complainant.

7.A perusal of the charge sheet shows that the marriage between the said Senthilkumar, who is the petitioner in Crl.O.P(MD)No.10021 of 2021 and the deceased took place on 17.06.2007. The deceased died due to poisoning on 22.06.2014. It is the case of the prosecution that the accused abetted the deceased to commit suicide. According to the prosecution, A1 did not allow https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  Crl.O.P.(MD).Nos.3572 of 2019 and 10021 of 2021 her wife to talk to her parents and all the accused had caused cruelty by demanding dowry. The complaint was lodged by the defacto complainant stating that he suspected the petitioners in his daughter's death.

8.Reading of the complaint would show that the defacto complainant had not stated anything about the alleged dowry demand. His only grievance was that his son in law Senthilkumar did not allow the deceased to talk to the defacto complainant and his family members. Admittedly, the defacto complainant had not been talking with the deceased. However, during investigation, the defacto complainant stated as follows:-

““vdJ kfs; ehr;rhuk;khs; vd;w Bfhfpyhit tujl;rid Bfl;L bre;jpy;Fkhh;, ePyhtjp vd;w yPyhtjp, bre;jpy;Fkhhpd; mk;kh gHdpak;khs; ntA;f bfhLikgLj;jpajhy; jhd; tp&^Ue;ij Foj;J nwe;Js;shh.;” The wife and the son of the defacto complainant have also stated the same in their 161 Cr.P.C statements. Apart from these witnesses, there are no other witnesses or any other evidence to suggest that the deceased was subjected to cruelty on account of dowry demand. The portion of statement extracted above would indicate that the allegations are vague. Neither the nature of dowry https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  Crl.O.P.(MD).Nos.3572 of 2019 and 10021 of 2021 demand, nor the details as to when this dowry demand was made has been spelt out. In order to constitute the offence under Section 498 IPC, the victim must have suffered either cruelty on account of dowry demand or cruelty of any other relative which is likely to drive the victim to commit suicide or commit grave injury to herself. This Court and the Hon'ble Apex Court had time and again held that where allegations of cruelty on account of dowry demand are made, unless it is backed with specific details, the continuation of the prosecution would be an abuse of process of law. In this regard, this Court relied upon the observations of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Varala Bharath Kumar vs. State of Telangana reported in (2017)9 SCC 413, which reads as follows:-
“8. We are conscious of the fact that, Section 498A was added to the Code with a view to punish the husband or any of his relatives, who harass or torture the wife to coerce her or her relatives to satisfy unlawful demands of dowry. Keeping the afore-mentioned object in mind, we have dealt with the matter. We do not find any allegation of subjecting the complainant to cruelty within the meaning of Section 498A of IPC. The records at hand could not disclose any willful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the complainant to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the complainant. So also, there is nothing on record to show that there was a demand of dowry by the appellants or any of their relatives, either prior to the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  Crl.O.P.(MD).Nos.3572 of 2019 and 10021 of 2021 marriage, during the marriage or after the marriage. The record also does not disclose anywhere that the husband of the complainant acted, with a view to coerce her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand of any property or valuable security.” and in the case of Shakson Belthissor vs. State of Kerala and others reported in (2009)14 SCC 466, which reads as follows:-
“21. In the light of the aforesaid language used in the Section, the provision would be applicable only to such a case where the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman subjects the said woman to cruelty. When the ingredients of the aforesaid Section are present in a particular case, in that event the person concerned against whom the offence is alleged would be tried in accordance with law in a trial instituted against him and if found guilty the accused would be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine. The said section contains an explanation, which defines ""cruelty"" as understood under Section 498A IPC. In order to understand the meaning of the expression `cruelty' as envisaged under Section 498A, there must be such a conduct on the part of the husband or relatives of the husband of woman which is of such a nature as to cause the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health whether mental or physical of the woman.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  Crl.O.P.(MD).Nos.3572 of 2019 and 10021 of 2021
22. When we examine the facts of the present case particularly the FIR and the charge sheet we find that there is no such allegation either in the FIR or in the charge sheet making out a prima facie case as narrated under explanation
(a). There is no allegation that there is any such conduct on the part of the appellant which could be said to be amounting to cruelty of such a nature as is likely to cause the Respondent No. 2 to commit suicide or to cause any injury to her life. The ingredient to constitute an offence under explanation (a) of Section 498A IPC are not at all mentioned either in FIR or in charge sheet and in absence thereof, no case is made out.
Therefore, explanation (a) as found in Section 498A IPC is clearly not attracted in the present case.

23. We, therefore, now proceed to examine as to whether the case would fall under explanation (b) of Section 498A of IPC constituting cruelty of the nature as mentioned in explanation (b). In order to constitute cruelty under the said provision there has to be harassment of the woman with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or a case is to be made out to the effect that there is a failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand. When the allegation made in the FIR and charge sheet is examined in the present case in the light of the aforesaid provision, we find that no prima facie case even under the aforesaid provision is made out to attract a case of cruelty.""

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  Crl.O.P.(MD).Nos.3572 of 2019 and 10021 of 2021

9. Thus, this Court finds that the only allegation is the vague statement which is found in the 161 Cr.P.C statements which is extracted above. The nature of dowry demand and the nature of cruelty and as to when it was made are not found anywhere in the charge sheet. Thus, no prima facie case is made out to attract the offence of Section 498A IPC.

10.As regards the offence under Section 306 IPC, it is well settled that in order to constitute the offence of abetment, there must be a positive averment which suggest that there was an intention on the part of the accused to instigate to do that thing, i.e., to instigate the commission of suicide which is one form of abetment. The second and third modes of abetment namely, engaging is conspiracy and intentionally aiding does not arise in the case of this nature. In order to constitute abetment by instigation, unless the evidence/allegation is of such nature that the accused intended to provoke, incite or encourage doing an act, the act of mere harassment even if found to be true, cannot be the basis for charging a person for abetment to commit suicide. In this regard, the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Gangula Mohan Reddy v. State of Andhra Pradesh reported in (2010) 1 SCC 750, which elaborately discusses the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  Crl.O.P.(MD).Nos.3572 of 2019 and 10021 of 2021 law on the subject, is extracted hereunder for better appreciation:-

“10. “Abetment” has been defined under Section 107 of the Code. We deem it appropriate to reproduce Section 107, which reads as under:
“107. Abetment of a thing.—A person abets the doing of a thing, who— First.—Instigates any person to do that thing; or Secondly.—Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing; or Thirdly.—Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.” Explanation 2 which has been inserted along with Section 107 reads as under:
“Explanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.”
11. The learned counsel for the appellant has placed reliance on a judgment of this Court in Mahendra Singh v. State of M.P. [1995 Supp (3) SCC 731 : 1995 SCC (Cri) 1157] In Mahendra Singh [1995 Supp (3) SCC 731 : 1995 SCC (Cri) 1157], the allegations levelled were as under:(SCC p.731, para 1) “1. … My mother-in-law and husband and sister-

in-law (husband's elder brother's wife) harassed me. They beat me and abused me. My husband Mahendra wants to marry a second time. He has illicit connections with my https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  Crl.O.P.(MD).Nos.3572 of 2019 and 10021 of 2021 sister-in-law. Because of these reasons and being harassed I want to die by burning.” The Court on the aforementioned allegations came to a definite conclusion that by no stretch the ingredients of abetment are attracted on the statement of the deceased. According to the appellant, the conviction of the appellant under Section 306 IPC merely on the basis of the aforementioned allegation of harassment of the deceased is unsustainable in law.

12. The learned counsel also placed reliance on another judgment of this Court in Ramesh Kumar v. State of Chhattisgarh [(2001) 9 SCC 618 : 2002 SCC (Cri) 1088] . A three-Judge Bench of this Court had an occasion to deal with a case of a similar nature. In a dispute between the husband and wife, the appellant husband uttered “you are free to do whatever you wish and go wherever you like”. Thereafter, the wife of the appellant Ramesh Kumar committed suicide. The Court in para 20 has examined different shades of the meaning of “instigation”. Para 20 reads as under:

(SCC p. 629) “20. Instigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or encourage to do ‘an act’. To satisfy the requirement of instigation though it is not necessary that actual words must be used to that effect or what constitutes instigation must necessarily and specifically be suggestive of the consequence. Yet a reasonable certainty to incite the consequence must be capable of being spelt out. The present one is not a case where the accused had by his acts or omission or by a continued course of conduct created such circumstances that the deceased was left with no other option except to commit suicide in which case an instigation may have been inferred. A word uttered in the fit of anger or emotion without intending the consequences to actually follow cannot be said to be instigation.” https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  Crl.O.P.(MD).Nos.3572 of 2019 and 10021 of 2021
13. In State of W.B. v. Orilal Jaiswal [(1994) 1 SCC 73 : 1994 SCC (Cri) 107] this Court has cautioned that the court should be extremely careful in assessing the facts and circumstances of each case and the evidence adduced in the trial for the purpose of finding whether the cruelty meted out to the victim had in fact induced her to end the life by committing suicide. If it appears to the court that a victim committing suicide was hypersensitive to ordinary petulance, discord and differences in domestic life quite common to the society to which the victim belonged and such petulance, discord and differences were not expected to induce a similarly circumstanced individual in a given society to commit suicide, the conscience of the court should not be satisfied for basing a finding that the accused charged of abetting the offence of suicide should be found guilty.

14. The Court in Ramesh Kumar case [(2001) 9 SCC 618 : 2002 SCC (Cri) 1088] came to the conclusion that there is no evidence and material available on record wherefrom an inference of the appellant-accused having abetted commission of suicide by Seema may necessarily be drawn.

15. In the instant case, the deceased was undoubtedly hypersensitive to ordinary petulance, discord and differences which happen in our day-to-day life. Human sensitivity of each individual differs from the other. Different people behave differently in the same situation.

16. This Court in Chitresh Kumar Chopra v. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) [(2009) 16 SCC 605 : (2009) 11 Scale 24] had an occasion to deal with this aspect of abetment. The Court dealt with the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  Crl.O.P.(MD).Nos.3572 of 2019 and 10021 of 2021 dictionary meaning of the words “instigation” and “goading”. The Court opined that there should be intention to provoke, incite or encourage the doing of an act by the latter. Each person's suicidability pattern is different from the other. Each person has his own idea of self-esteem and self- respect. Therefore, it is impossible to lay down any straitjacket formula in dealing with such cases. Each case has to be decided on the basis of its own facts and circumstances.

17. Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained. The intention of the legislature and the ratio of the cases decided by this Court is clear that in order to convict a person under Section 306 IPC there has to be a clear mens rea to commit the offence. It also requires an active act or direct act which led the deceased to commit suicide seeing no option and this act must have been intended to push the deceased into such a position that he committed suicide.”

11. Further in Gurcharan Singh v. State of Punjab reported in (2020) 10 SCC 200 in paragraphs 15, 16, 17 and 18 it is observed as follows :-

15. As in all crimes, mens rea has to be established. To prove the offence of abetment, as specified under Section 107 IPC, the state of mind to commit a particular crime https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  Crl.O.P.(MD).Nos.3572 of 2019 and 10021 of 2021 must be visible, to determine the culpability. In order to prove mens rea, there has to be something on record to establish or show that the appellant herein had a guilty mind and in furtherance of that state of mind, abetted the suicide of the deceased. The ingredient of mens rea cannot be assumed to be ostensibly present but has to be visible and conspicuous. However, what transpires in the present matter is that both the trial court as well as the High Court never examined whether the appellant had the mens rea for the crime he is held to have committed.
The conviction of the appellant by the trial court as well as the High Court on the theory that the woman with two young kids might have committed suicide possibly because of the harassment faced by her in the matrimonial house is not at all borne out by the evidence in the case. Testimonies of the PWs do not show that the wife was unhappy because of the appellant and she was forced to take such a step on his account.

16.The necessary ingredients for the offence under Section 306 IPC were considered in S.S. Chheena v. Vijay Kumar Mahajan [S.S. Chheena v. Vijay Kumar Mahajan, (2010) 12 SCC 190 : (2011) 2 SCC (Cri) 465] where explaining the concept of abetment, Dalveer Bhandari, J. wrote as under :

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  Crl.O.P.(MD).Nos.3572 of 2019 and 10021 of 2021 “25. Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained. The intention of the legislature and the ratio of the cases decided by this Court is clear that in order to convict a person under Section 306 IPC there has to be a clear mens rea to commit the offence. It also requires an active act or direct act which led the deceased to commit suicide seeing no option and that act must have been intended to push the deceased into such a position that he committed suicide.”
17. While dealing with a case of abetment of suicide in Amalendu Pal v. State of W.B. [Amalendu Pal v. State of W.B., (2010) 1 SCC 707 : (2010) 1 SCC (Cri) 896] , Dr M.K. Sharma, J. writing for the Division Bench explained the parameters of Section 306 IPC in the following terms : (SCC p. 712, paras 12-13) “12. Thus, this Court has consistently taken the view that before holding an accused guilty of an offence under Section 306 IPC, the court must scrupulously examine the facts and circumstances of the case and also assess the evidence adduced before it in order to find out whether the cruelty and harassment meted out to the victim had left the victim with no other alternative but to put an end to her life. It is also to be borne in mind that in cases of alleged abetment of suicide there must be proof of direct or indirect acts of incitement to the commission of suicide. Merely on the allegation of harassment without there being any positive action proximate to the time of occurrence on the part of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  Crl.O.P.(MD).Nos.3572 of 2019 and 10021 of 2021 the accused which led or compelled the person to commit suicide, conviction in terms of Section 306 IPC is not sustainable.

13. In order to bring a case within the purview of Section 306 IPC there must be a case of suicide and in the commission of the said offence, the person who is said to have abetted the commission of suicide must have played an active role by an act of instigation or by doing certain act to facilitate the commission of suicide. Therefore, the act of abetment by the person charged with the said offence must be proved and established by the prosecution before he could be convicted under Section 306 IPC.”

18. In Mangat Ram v. State of Haryana [Mangat Ram v. State of Haryana, (2014) 12 SCC 595 : (2014) 5 SCC (Cri) 127] , which again was a case of wife's unnatural death, speaking for the Division Bench, K.S.P. Radhakrishnan, J. rightly observed as under : (SCC p. 606, para 24) “24. We find it difficult to comprehend the reasoning of the High Court [Mangat Ram v. State of Haryana, Criminal Appeal No. 592-SB of 1997, decided on 27-5-2008 (P&H)] that “no prudent man is to commit suicide unless abetted to do so”. A woman may attempt to commit suicide due to various reasons, such as, depression, financial difficulties, disappointment in love, tired of domestic worries, acute or chronic ailments and so on and need not be due to abetment. The reasoning of the High Court that no prudent man will commit suicide unless abetted to do so by someone else, is a perverse reasoning.” https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  Crl.O.P.(MD).Nos.3572 of 2019 and 10021 of 2021

12.Further, this Court in a similar case in Crl.O.P.No.13628 of 2014 dated 05.08.2014 (Sajojini vs. State) had held as follows:-

“11.By referring to above cited observations, the Hon'ble Supreme court in the decision reported in (2010) 1 SCC 750 is of the view that the abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing and there must be a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing suicide and such act must have been intended to push the deceased into such a position to commit suicide failing which conviction cannot be sustained. However, in this case, the act complained of is not one such positive act on the side of the petitioner, as such, no prima facie case is made out against the petitioner for the offence under section 306 IPC. Further, the same act, being one single incident of such nature, will not attract the ingredients of section 498A also.”
13.We have already held that in the instant case, cruelty on account of dowry demand has not been established and the offence of Section 498A IPC has not been made out for the reasons stated above. When the allegations in the impugned charge sheet does not even constitute the offence Section 498A IPC, there is no question of inferring instigation to commit suicide on account of cruelty suffered by the deceased due to act of the petitioners. Applying the principles laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court and this Court, this Court finds https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  Crl.O.P.(MD).Nos.3572 of 2019 and 10021 of 2021 that in the instant case, there is no allegation of any positive act committed by the petitioners to instigate the deceased to commit suicide. There is nothing to suggest that there was cruelty and that cruelty/harassment allegedly meted out to the victim had left her with no other alternative, but to put an end to her life.

In such circumstances, the proceedings against the petitioners is an abuse of process of law and hence, the same is liable to be quashed.

14.Accordingly, both the Criminal Original Petitions are allowed and the Charge Sheet in P.R.C.No.54 of 2014 on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate Court, Uthamapalayam is quashed in entirety. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.

100.1. The Government of India may consider the introduction of a separate enactment in the nature of a Bail Act so as to streamline the grant of bails.
100.2. The investigating agencies and their officers are duty-bound to comply with the mandate of Sections 41 and 41-A of the Code and the directions issued by this Court in Arnesh Kumar [Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar, (2014) 8 SCC 273 : (2014) 3 SCC (Cri) 449]. Any dereliction on their part has to be brought to the notice of the higher authorities by the court followed by appropriate action.
100.3. The courts will have to satisfy themselves on the compliance of Sections 41 and 41-A of the Code. Any non-compliance would entitle the accused for grant of bail.
100.4. All the State Governments and the Union Territories are directed to facilitate Standing Orders for the procedure to be followed under Section 41 and 41-A of the Code while taking note of the order of the High Court of Delhi dated 7-2-2018 in Amandeep Singh Johar v. State (NCT of Delhi) [Amandeep Singh Johar v. State (NCT of Delhi), 2018 SCC OnLine Del 13448] and the Standing Order issued by Delhi Police i.e. Standing Order 109 of 2020, to comply with the mandate of Section 41-A of the Code.
100.5. There need not be any insistence of a bail application while considering the application under Sections 88, 170, 204 and 209 of the Code.
100.6. There needs to be a strict compliance of the mandate laid down in the judgment of this Court in Siddharth [Siddharth v. State of U.P., (2022) 1 SCC 676 : (2022) 1 SCC (Cri) 423].
100.7. The State and Central Governments will have to comply with the directions issued by this Court from time to time with respect to constitution of special courts. The High Court in consultation with the State Governments will have to undertake an exercise on the need for the special courts. The vacancies in the position of Presiding Officers of the special courts will have to be filled up expeditiously.
100.8. The High Courts are directed to undertake the exercise of finding out the undertrial prisoners who are not able to comply with the bail conditions. After doing so, appropriate action will have to be taken in light of Section 440 of the Code, facilitating the release.
100.9. While insisting upon sureties the mandate of Section 440 of the Code has to be kept in mind.
100.10. An exercise will have to be done in a similar manner to comply with the mandate of Section 436-A of the Code both at the district judiciary level and the High Court as earlier directed by this Court in Bhim Singh [Bhim Singh v. Union of India, (2015) 13 SCC 605 : (2016) 1 SCC (Cri) 663] , followed by appropriate orders.
100.11. Bail applications ought to be disposed of within a period of two weeks except if the provisions mandate otherwise, with the exception being an intervening application. Applications for anticipatory bail are expected to be disposed of within a period of six weeks with the exception of any intervening application.""
6. It is needless to mention that the Apex Court in Satender Kumar Antil vs Central Bureau of Investigation and another; (2021) 10 SCC 773 has also approved for grant of interim bail till disposal of bail application. Para 6 of the Satender Kumar Antil (supra) decided on 07.10.2021 is being quoted as under:

""6. We may also notice an aspect submitted by Mr Luthra that while issuing notice to consider bail, the trial court is not precluded from granting interim bail taking into consideration the conduct of the accused during the investigation which has not warranted arrest. On this aspect also we would give our imprimatur and naturally the bail application to be ultimately considered, would be guided by the statutory provisions.""
7. For a period of three weeks from today or till appearance of the applicants before the court below, whichever is earlier, no coercive action shall be taken against the applicants in the aforesaid case.

Amit Raj Pal vs Smt. Sonika @ Simran,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/116108787/,"Allahabad High Court
Amit Raj Pal vs Smt. Sonika @ Simran on 7 January, 2025
Hon'ble Donadi Ramesh,J.

1. This appeal under Section 19 of the Family Court Act, 1984 is by the appellant/husband challenging the judgment of trial court, dated 07.02.2019, rejecting the application filed by the appellant under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 for dissolution of marriage solemnized with the respondent/wife.

2. Briefly stated facts of the case are that marriage of appellant was solemnized with the respondent on 27.10.2007 according to the Hindu customs and traditions. The proceedings for dissolution of marriage has been instituted by the appellant on the ground that the wife suppressed the fact that she had solemnized two marriages prior to her marriage with the appellant. The first marriage of the respondent was solemnized with one Ramesh Mehta and a female child was born out of such wedlock. The first husband of the respondent, namely Ramesh Mehta, took divorce from respondent. It was thereafter that respondent solemnized second marriage with one Bharat, who was resident of Bulandshahr and by falsely implicating him the respondent extracted Rs.5 lac from him. The second marriage of the respondent with Bharat was not legally dissolved and by suppressing such fact the third marriage was solemnized by the respondent with the appellant. The appellant has then stated that the respondent tortured and harassed his elderly parents and also generated pressure on them to part with their house bearing municipal no. C 64 Church Compound, Saharanpur. The respondent wife in collusion with certain land grabbers also threatened the appellant husband. The application under Section 13 of the Act of 1955 also contained allegation to the effect that the respondent never attended to her duties nor gave him food etc. and the appellant was often required to leave for work without having his meal in the morning. The respondent used to hurl abuses and also ill-treated in-laws as a result of which the appellant left his house alongwith parents and started living in a rented accommodation. It is further stated that the respondent in order to secure ouster of the appellant and his parents also lodged an FIR in Case Crime No.484 of 2011 under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 IPC and 3/4 of Dowry Prohibition Act. The appellant's father since needed money for his treatment as such the house no. C 64, Church Compound, Saharanpur has been sold to the sister of the respondent vide sale deed dated 10.05.2012 and the possession over such house is of the respondent's sister and her husband. Since there was a threat to life from the respondent to both the appellant and his parents, as such prayer is made to dissolve the marriage between the parties.

3. The respondent has entered appearance in proceedings before the trial court and except the fact that the marriage was solemnized with the appellant on 27.10.2007 she denied other allegations including the factum of second marriage. Respondent, however, has admitted that her first marriage was dissolved and asserts that the appellant is also a divorcee. Serious allegations against husband have been made and the respondent asserted that notwithstanding various acts of harassment she had offered to live with the appellant.

4. Proceedings under Section 9 of the Act of 1955 for restitution of conjugal rights were also instituted by the respondent. Both the proceedings have been heard together and the trial court by the composite judgment has rejected both the applications filed by the appellant under Section 13 and by the respondent under Section 9 of the Act of 1955. The respondent has not preferred any appeal against rejection of her application under Section 9 of the Act and it is only the appellant husband, who has preferred the present appeal before this Court, against rejection of his application under Section 13 of the Act of 1955.

5. Though the matter has been called out in the revised list but none appears for the respondent. Shri Vedmani Sharma, holding brief of Shri Sandeep Saxena, counsel for the appellant has been heard at length, on his behalf.

6. We have perused the paper book as also records of the trial court. The plea for dissolution of marriage is primarily based upon the allegation that the wife has suppressed the factum of second marriage with Bharat resident of Bulandshahr; she ill-treated the appellant and his parents as a result of which they were forced to leave the house; criminal proceedings with ulterior motive were instituted against the appellant and his parents by the respondent resulting in lodging of FIR in Case Crime No.484 of 2011 under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 IPC and 3/4 of Dowry Prohibition Act.

7. The evidence on record is categorical, inasmuch as the parties clearly admit that at the time of contracting the marriage on 27.10.2007 both the appellant and respondent were divorcee. The divorce decree was passed by the competent family court dissolving first marriage of respondent with Ramesh Mehta. To this extent the facts are admitted by both the parties. The parties, however, are at issue on the aspect of contracting of second marriage by the respondent with one Bharat. On this aspect of alleged second marriage of respondent with Bharat resident of Bulandshahr the trial court has returned a categorical finding that onus to prove the second marriage is on the husband. This was so as the factum of second marriage was asserted by the appellant as being the ground for dissolution of marriage. The finding of the trial court that no evidence has been led by the appellant to prove the second marriage of respondent with Bharat, resident of Bulandshahr, although is assailed but no perversity or illegality in such finding has been pointed out to this Court at the time of hearing of appeal.

8. We have carefully examined the materials and records placed before us. We find that except for bald allegations made by the appellant that the respondent had contracted second marriage with Bharat resident of Bulandshahr there is no material or evidence on record led by the appellant during the course of proceedings before the trial court. Since such fact was specifically asserted by the appellant the onus clearly was on him to prove such fact. In the absence of any evidence led by the appellant to prove the second marriage of respondent wife with Bharat, we find no illegality or perversity in the finding returned by the trial court that the appellant had failed to prove the second marriage of respondent with Bharat.

9. Trial court has further taken note of the fact that after the marriage was solemnized between the parties the appellant had instituted proceedings under Section 13 of the Act of 1955 for dissolution of marriage being Case No. 313 of 2010. Thereafter, a compromise was arrived at between the parties and on its strength the appellant had withdrawn the proceedings under Section 13 vide order dated 29.08.2010 and the respondent had also withdrawn the proceedings instituted under the Domestic Violence Act vide order dated 17.01.2011. It is in this context that the trial court has observed that the parties since had resolved their differences and proceedings were withdrawn by them indicating that the dispute between the parties was amicably resolved, it would not be appropriate to consider the application of husband on the ground of desertion.

10. It is within less than three years of withdrawal of such proceedings that fresh proceedings under Section 13 of the Act of 1955 have been instituted by the appellant husband on the ground of cruelty practiced by the respondent wife, inasmuch as he alongwith his parents are living separately from his wife for the last three years. Except for the testimony of appellant in that regard no other evidence has been placed on record. Trial court has not found substance in the contention that the respondent had neglected to perform her matrimonial obligation or that she extended any threat to appellant and her in-laws.

11. The thrust of appellant's contention in respect of alleged cruelty was the fact that appellant with his parents were compelled to live separately in a rented accommodation. This plea is sought to be proved by the testimony of PW-2, who happens to be the son of landlord where the appellant with his parents is allegedly living on rent. The testimony of PW-2 has been carefully examined by the trial court. PW-2 has admitted that he is co-worker with the appellant and is his close friend. PW-2 in his testimony has also admitted that neither any rent receipt was given, nor any evidence regarding occupancy of tenanted premises has been placed on record. The trial court has also taken note of the fact that the parents of appellant were also implicated in the matrimonial dispute instituted by the respondent wife and in the bail applications filed by them and on the sureties etc. their address was mentioned as C 64, Church Compound, Saharanpur. The court below has observed that the allegation of appellant that he alongwith his parents were compelled to leave the house on account of torture by wife, is thus not substantiated. Trial court has also noticed that there is a civil dispute pending in respect of matrimonial house and, therefore, the plea that appellant and his parents were forced to leave the house is not substantiated.

12. We have also perused the judgment of family court in which detailed discussions are made on the specific contentions urged by the appellant and cogent reasons have been given for rejecting his application under Section 13 of the Act of 1955. The trial court has also noticed the fact that the respondent wife was still willing to live with the appellant husband and merely on the asking of appellant for a divorce such a decree could not be passed.

13. Having given our thoughtful consideration to the respective arguments advanced on the basis of materials available on record, we find that none of the grounds set up by the appellant husband to seek divorce have been substantiated during the course of trial. The plea of desertion of the appellant from the respondent for over three years is also not substantiated on the basis of evidence placed on record. In such circumstances, the rejection of application of the appellant husband under Section 13 of the Act of 1955 by the trial court cannot be said to be suffering from any infirmity or illegality in law, which may persuade this Court to interfere in the matter. Consequently, the present appeal fails and is dismissed.

In the said case, the learned Magistrate by judgment and order dated 3.05.2015 convicted accused No.1 for the NC: 2025:KHC-K:56 offence punishable under Section 498A of IPC while acquitting him for other charge sheeted offences. Learned Magistrate had acquitted accused Nos.2 and 3 for all the offences for which they were charge sheeted.

4. Being aggrieved by the judgment of conviction and order of sentence passed by the learned Magistrate convicting accused No.1 for the offence punishable under Section 498A of IPC and sentencing him to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of six months and pay fine of Rs.10,000/- and in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of one month, accused No.1 had filed Criminal Appeal No.25/2015 before the Court of Principal Sessions Judge, Vijayapur, which was allowed by the Appellate Court vide impugned Judgment and order dated 16.08.2016. Assailing the same, the State is before this Court in this revision petition.

5. Learned High Court Government Pleader appearing for the State submits that the Appellate Court has erred in extending the benefit of acquittal as against NC: 2025:KHC-K:56 accused No.1 only for the reason that accused Nos.2 and 3 were acquitted by the Trial Court. She submits that evidence of PW.1, PW.2 and PW.5 has not been properly appreciated by the Appellate Court, which has resulted in passing of the impugned judgment and order of acquittal. Accordingly, she prays to allow the revision petition.

6. Learned counsel appearing for the respondent submits that Appellate Court has rightly acquitted accused No.1 since the allegations made by all the witnesses against accused Nos.1, 2 and 3 are similar. He submits that there are no specific allegations as against accused No.1 and therefore, the Appellate Court was justified in acquitting accused No.1. Accordingly, he prays to dismiss the revision petition.


7. Prosecution to substantiate the allegations made against accused persons had examined ten witnesses as PW.1 to PW.10 before the Trial Court and had got marked five documents as Exs.P1 to P5. On behalf of NC: 2025:KHC-K:56 the defence, no documents were marked nor was any defence evidence led.


8. PW.1, PW.2 and PW.5 are the witnesses, who have made allegations as against accused persons. Ex.P1 is the copy of the first information submitted by PW.1. In Ex.P1, it is stated that PW.1 was ill-treated in her matrimonial house for the reason that she did not know cooking and she was black in colour. It is also alleged that she was ill-treated in her matrimonial house for giving birth to two girl babies. However, during the course of deposition, PW.1 has not made any allegation against accused persons that she was being ill-treated in the matrimonial house for the reason that she had given birth to two girl babies. On the other hand, perusal of the deposition of PW.1 would go to show that she has made omnibus allegations against all the accused persons and specific overt-act, which would attract the alleged offence under Section 498A of IPC as against accused No.1 is not made by her. Even PW.2 and PW.5 have not made any NC: 2025:KHC-K:56 specific allegation as against accused No.1, which would attract the offence punishable under Section 498A of IPC. Allegations made by PW.1, PW.2 and PW.5 as against all the accused persons are omnibus in nature.

9. Considering the aforesaid aspects of the matter, the learned Magistrate had acquitted accused Nos.2 and 3 but had convicted accused No.1 for the offence punishable under Section 498A of IPC, while he was acquitted for the other charge sheeted offences. Undisputedly, the judgment and order of acquittal of accused Nos.2 and 3 has not been questioned by the State or by the de-facto complainant/PW1. The said judgment and order of acquittal passed in favour of accused Nos.2 and 3 has attained finality.


10. The Appellate Court having appreciated this aspect of the matter has held that the Trial Court was not justified in convicting accused No.1 while acquitting accused Nos.2 and 3 since the allegations made by the witnesses i.e., PW.1, PW.2 and PW.5 as against the NC: 2025:KHC-K:56 accused persons were common and no specific allegations are made against accused No.1, which would attract the alleged offence punishable under Section 498A of IPC. In addition to the same, it is also noticed that independent witnesses examined on behalf of the prosecution have not supported the case of the prosecution and they were treated as hostile witnesses. Nothing material has been elicited from the mouth of these hostile witnesses even though they were cross-examined by the Public Prosecutor.


11. The Appellate Court also has noticed that there is an allegation made against accused No.1 that he had married another lady after PW.1 was sent out of the matrimonial house. Therefore, it appears that PW.1 had taken shelter in her parents house and she had approached the police only after accused No.1 had allegedly contracted another marriage. Therefore, it is apparent that there is a delay in approaching the police and no explanation whatsoever has been offered by the NC: 2025:KHC-K:56 first informant for the same. The Appellate Court having taken into consideration all these aspects of the matter, has acquitted accused No.1, whereas, the Trial Court has convicted accused No.1 for the offence punishable under Section 498A of IPC though perusal of the depositions of the witnesses will go to show that common allegations are made against all the accused persons.


12. Under the circumstances, I am of the considered opinion that the Appellate Court was fully justified in setting aside the judgment of conviction and order of sentence passed by the Trial Court in C.C.No.143/2013 dated 30.05.2015 and acquitting accused No.1 for the offence punishable under Section 498A of IPC. Therefore, I do not find any good ground to entertain this revision position. Accordingly, the same is dismissed.

Smt. Shantamma vs The State Of Karnataka,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/119062342/,"Karnataka High Court
Smt. Shantamma vs The State Of Karnataka on 7 January, 2025
1. The petitioners, accused Nos.2 to 4, challenge the registration of the FIR in Crime No.45/2024 with Haveri Women Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.

NC: 2025:KHC-D:156

2. The second respondent lodged the FIR stating that she is the legally wedded wife of accused No.1 and that their marriage was solemnized in 2013. Two children were born out of the wedlock. She resided in the matrimonial home in Haveri, while her husband, accused No.1, worked in Raichur and visited the matrimonial home as and when convenient. Subsequently, when accused No.1 was transferred to Dandeli, the second respondent began residing with him there. During their stay in Dandeli, accused No.1 allegedly harassed her physically and mentally and demanded money from her parental home.

3. Later, the couple shifted back to Haveri. During her stay in Haveri, the second respondent alleged that accused No.1 (her husband), accused No.2 (mother-in-law), accused No.3 (brother-in-law), and accused No.4 (sister-in-law) harassed her physically and mentally and demanded money from her parental home. She alleged that on 24.06.2023, she was forced to leave the matrimonial home and has been residing in Byadgi since then. Further, she claimed that on 07.06.2024, when she went to the matrimonial home in Haveri to visit her children, the accused abused her and assaulted her.

4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners, the learned Additional Government Advocate for respondent No.1- State, and the learned counsel for respondent No.2 (informant).

5. As per the averments in the complaint, the second respondent left the matrimonial home on 24.06.2023. Admittedly, accused No.1 had already filed a petition for the dissolution of NC: 2025:KHC-D:156 marriage on 30.06.2023. The impugned FIR was lodged on 08.07.2024, more than a year after the second respondent claimed to have left the matrimonial home.

6. While the allegations against accused No.1 are specific in nature, relating to physical and mental harassment and the demand for money, the allegations against the petitioners (accused Nos.2 to 4) are general and omnibus in nature. There are no specific overt acts attributed to accused Nos.2 to 4 to substantiate how and in what manner they allegedly subjected the second respondent to cruelty.

7. In the absence of specific and corroborative allegations against the petitioners, continuing criminal proceedings against them would amount to an abuse of the process of law.

8. The Apex Court in the case of Kahkashan Kausar @ Sonam and Others vs. State of Bihar reported in 2022 SCC OnLine SC 162at para No.18 has held as follows:

""18. The above-mentioned decisions clearly demonstrate that this court has at numerous instances expressed concern over the misuse of section 498A IPC and the increased tendency of implicating relatives of the husband in matrimonial disputes, without analysing the long term ramifications of a trial on the complainant as well as the accused. It is further manifest from the said judgments that false implication by way of general omnibus allegations made in the course of matrimonial dispute, if left unchecked would result in misuse of the process of law. Therefore, this court by way of its judgments has warned the courts from proceeding against the relatives and in-laws of the husband when no prima facie case is made out against them.""
NC: 2025:KHC-D:156

9. Therefore, accused Nos.2 to 4 cannot be subjected to investigation only on the basis of omnibus and general allegation. Therefore, continuation of investigation against the petitioners/accused herein would be an abuse of process of law.

10. Hence, I pass the following:

ORDER
i) Accordingly, the criminal petition is allowed.
ii) The impugned FIR in Crime No.0045/2024 registered by the Haveri Women Police Station, Haveri Sub-Division, Haveri, insofar as accused Nos.2 to 4, the petitioners herein, is hereby quashed.

http://www.judis.nic.in

2. On the basis of the complaint, Ex.P1, given by PW.1, who is the father of the deceased, Amudha, the Appellant/ accused was charge sheeted for the offences under Sections 498A and 304B of IPC and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, alleging that the marriage between the Appellant/ accused and the deceased had taken place on 28.6.2007 and that at the time of marriage, the Appellant/ accused had demanded and accepted two and half sovereigns of gold jewels and further, demanded Rs.10,000/- to purchase a vehicle, as dowry and that the Appellant/ accused had pledged the jewels and misappropriated the amount and that the accused had demanded more money as dowry from the deceased and that due to the harassment meted out to her and due to the abetment by the Appellant/ accused, the deceased committed suicide by hanging at the house of the accused on 14.10.2007 between 6.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m. and that the death of the deceased caused otherwise than under normal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and that soon before her death, the deceased was subjected to cruelty and harassment in connection with demand of dowry.

3. The case was taken on file in SC.No.333 of 2008, by the Sessions Judge, Mahila Court, Salem, and necessary charges were framed. The accused had denied the charges and sought for trial. In order to bring home the charges against the accused, the prosecution examined PW.1 to PW.11 and also marked Exs.P1 to P12 and Mos.1 and 2.

4. PW.1, 2 and 3 respectively are father, mother and brother of the deceased; PW.4, is the mahazar witness; PW.5, is the brother-in-law of P.W.1; PW.6, is the Doctor, who conducted post mortem; PW.7, is the Head Constable of Vazhappadi Police Station, who received the complaint from the P.W.1; PW.8, is the Sub-Inspector of Police, who conducted investigation; PW.9, is the RDO; PW.10, is http://www.judis.nic.in the Assistant Director in Forensic Department; PW.11, is the Additional Superintendent of Police, who conducted further investigation.

5. Ex.P1, dated 15.10.2007 is the complaint, Ex.P2, dated 15.10.2007 is the Observation Mahazar, Ex.P3 dated 15.10.2007 is the Seizer Mahazar, Ex.P4 dated 15.10.2007 is the requisition to conduct post mortem, Ex.P5 dated 15.10.2007 is the post mortem certificate, Ex.P6 dated 23.11.2007 is the chemical examination report with final opinion of P.W.6, Ex.P7 dated 15.10.2007 is the First Information Report, Ex.P8 dated 15.10.2007 is the Inquest report, Ex.P9 dated 15.10.2007 is the RDO's report, Ex.P10 dated 23.11.2007 is the Chemical examination report, Ex.P11 dated 15.10.2007 is the Rough Sketch, Ex.P12 dated 17.10.2007 is the Section alteration report.

6. On completion of the evidence on the side of the prosecution, the accused was questioned under Section 313 Cr.PC as to the incriminating circumstances found in the evidence of prosecution witnesses and the accused has come with the version of total denial and stated that he has been falsely implicated in this case.

7. The court below, after hearing the arguments advanced on either side and also looking into the materials available on record, found the accused/appellant guilty and awarded punishments, as referred to above, which is challenged in this Criminal Appeal.

8. This court heard the submissions of the learned counsel on either side.

9. The learned counsel for the appellant/accused has assailed the impugned order of conviction and sentence, on the following infirmities, discrepancies and grounds:-

http://www.judis.nic.in a. The Prosecution has miserably failed to prove the guilt of the Appellant/ accused, for the offences under Sections 498A and 304B of IPC, by letting in cogent and convincing evidence, both oral and documentary and in other words, the essential ingredients of Sections 498A and 304B of IPC have not been made out to warrant conviction on the Appellant/ accused.
b. PW.1 to PW.3, who are the father, mother and sister of the deceased, are interested witnesses. No independent witness was examined in order to prove the guilt of the Appellant/ accused.
c. Though the Appellant/ accused was rightly acquitted from the offence under Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, which provides penalty for dowry demand, the Trial Court erred in convicting the Appellant/ accused under Sections 304B and 498A of IPC on the same set of facts.
d. The alleged demand of dowry has not been established, inasmuch as there is no such allegation in the complaint, Ex.P1 given by PW.1 and except the ligature mark caused by hanging, there was no other injuries on the body of the deceased to prove that the Appellant/ accused harassed the deceased, by demanding dowry. There is not even an iota of evidence both oral and documentary to show the demand of dowry by the Appellant/ accused and harassment or cruelty meted out to the deceased by the Appellant/ accused.
e. Though the occurrence was said to have taken place on 14.10.2007, between 6.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m., the complaint was given only on 15.10.2007. The said delay was also not explained satisfactorily by the Prosecution.
10. The learned counsel for the appellant/accused would ultimately contend that mere factum of unnatural death in matrimonial home within seven years of marriage is not sufficient to convict the Appellant/ accused under Sections 304B http://www.judis.nic.in and 498A of IPC and that only when the Prosecution proves beyond doubt that the deceased was subjected to cruelty in connection with dowry demand soon before her death, presumption under Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act can be invoked and that the Prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubts by cogent evidence and that the Trial Court is not correct and justified in convicting and sentencing the appellant/accused and hence, the appellant/ accused is entitled for acquittal. In support of his contentions, he would rely on the decision of the Honourable Supreme Court reported in 2013 3 SCC 684 (Vipin Jaiswal Vs. State of AP), judgement of the Honourable Supreme Court dated 9.3.2015, made Crl.A.No.1145 of 2012 (Major Singh Vs. State of Punjab) and the judgement of this Court, dated 2.3.2012, made in Crl.A.No.619 of 2003 (Pandiarajan and others Vs. State).

11. On the other hand, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the Respondent, while supporting the impugned judgement of conviction and sentence, would contend that the death of the deceased had occurred within four months of her marriage and the deceased committed suicide due to the demand of Rs.10,000/- for purchasing a vehicle, which is evident from the evidence of PW.9, Revenue Divisional Officer and that even though the PW.1 to PW.3 are father, mother and brother of the deceased, their evidence is consistent and credible and amply established that the deceased was subjected to harassment and cruelty in connection with the demand of dowry and on their evidence, the Trial Court rightly convicted and sentenced the Appellants under Section 498A and 304B of IPC and hence, the impugned judgement of conviction and sentence warrants no interference by this Court.

http://www.judis.nic.in

12. I have given my careful and anxious consideration to the rival contentions put forward by either side and thoroughly scanned through the entire evidence available on record and also perused the impugned judgement of conviction, including relevant provisions of Law.

13. What is to be seen is as to whether the Prosecution has proved its case beyond all reasonable doubts, by cogent evidence and satisfied the essential ingredients of Sections 498A and 304B of IPC.

14. At the outset, it is pertinent to state that the Honourable Supreme Court in various decisions, has held that nobody be convicted on surmises and conjectures. Similarly, nobody be convicted on mere suspicion, however strong it may be. Similarly, it has been held that the evidence can be rejected if it suffers from any serious infirmities or if there is any inherent inconsistency in the testimony. At the same time, if there is intrinsic merit in the evidence of the witnesses, the same cannot be rejected. Discrepancies and contradictions if found, material and substantial in respect of vital aspects of the facts, then the entire testimony can be discarded. Bearing in mind, the aforesaid principles, the rival submissions made by the parties are to be analysed and a detailed and proper analysis of the evidence is essentially required.

15. It is settled position of law that the delay in lodging the complaint is fatal to the case of the Prosecution. In the case on hand, it is seen from the materials on record that though the occurrence was said to have taken place on 14.10.2007, between 6.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m., the complaint was given only on 15.10.2007, for which, there was no explanation, much less, valid explanation, given by the Prosecution, thereby creating a doubt regarding the genuineness of the complaint. http://www.judis.nic.in

16. In the case on hand, the fact that the deceased had committed suicide by hanging is not in dispute. It is to be seen that whether the death of the deceased occurring within seven years of marriage is due to cruelty or harassment or in connection with demand of dowry and whether there is reasonable nexus between the alleged harassment and death.

17. In order to attract the provisions of Section 498A of IPC, the cruelty or harassment meted out to the wife by her husband or relatives of her husband should be to the extent that it became unbearable. Thus, the essential ingredients of Section 498A of IPC are:-

1. A woman must be married.
2. She must be subjected to cruelty.
3. Cruelty must be of the nature of harassment of such woman, with a view to coerce her to meet unlawful demand for property or valuable security.
18. To sustain the conviction under Section 304B of IPC and to prove a death as 'dowry death', the essential ingredients to be established are that the death of a women should be caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances and such a death should have occurred within seven years of her marriage and that soon before her death, she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry.

19. If any death is caused in connection with dowry demand, Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 comes into play. The essential requirements to be proved for raising a presumption under Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 are that (i) whether the accused has committed dowry death of a woman,

(ii) a woman was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or his relatives, http://www.judis.nic.in

(iii) such cruelty or harassment was for or in connection with any demand for dowry and (iv) such cruelty or harassment was soon before her death.

20. On a careful scrutiny of the evidence, both oral and documentary, it is seen that in Ex.P1, the complaint given by PW.1, who is the father of the deceased, the allegation was only regarding missing of a gold jewel, which was given at the time of marriage and PW.1 has also admitted the same in his cross- examination. Further, PW.1 has not spoken anything about the demand of dowry having made by the appellant/accused to the deceased. Further, nothing has been spoken about any kind of harassment meted out to the deceased on account of demand of money and no specific date has been mentioned either in the evidence or in Ex.P1, complaint.

21. It has also come out in evidence, particularly, the evidence of PW.1, that the deceased had come to his house, three months prior to the occurrence and there she had taken food and also taken food for her mother-in-law. This conduct would show that there was no kind of harassment meted out to her. Like wise, PW.2, who is the mother of the deceased has also not stated anything about the demand of dowry or any money. She had stated that her daughter was living happily and thereafter, she felt sad and that she came to know that her daughter died. Further, nothing had been stated, as if any demand of dowry has been made and that the appellant/accused committed cruelty on her.

22. P.W.3, who is the younger brother of the deceased, is only a hearsay witness and he has not spoken anything about the demand of dowry. P.W.5, who is none other than the brother of PW.2 and the maternal uncle of the deceased has also not spoken anything, as if there was any demand of dowry. http://www.judis.nic.in

23. Further, no independent witnesses have been examined on the side of the Prosecution to prove that the deceased had committed suicide, due to demand of dowry, soon before the death or that she had committed suicide, since her husband scolded her. This Court finds no evidence to establish the essential ingredients of Sections 498A and 304B of IPC.

24. PW.9, Revenue Divisional Officer, has also admitted in his evidence that the Appellant had asked Rs.10,000/- for purchase of a vehicle and at that time, he told the Appellant/ accused that he could not give that money and later the Appellant purchased the vehicle. But, he did not know as to how the Appellant purchased the vehicle.

25. The Trial Court has acquitted the Appellant/ accused under Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, which provides for penalty for demanding dowry. When the Appellant/ accused was discharged from the offence under Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, on same set of facts, convicting the Appellant/ accused under Sections 498A and 304B of IPC is not proper.

26. It is also seen from the inquest report, Ex.P8 that the allegation of missing of gold chain cannot be sustained, since the Appellant himself admitted that later he pledged his wife's jewel and purchased the vehicle and consequently, the report, Ex.P9 of the Revenue Divisional Officer cannot also be accepted.

27. Further, except the evidence of PW.1 to PW.3, who are the father, mother and brother of the deceased, no other independent witnesses were examined, about the demand of dowry from the deceased. There is not even an iota of evidence to show that there was agreement between the parties, regarding jewels or valuables at the time of marriage or after marriage. http://www.judis.nic.in

28. The above reasoning would go to that the allegation of harassment and demand of dowry made by the Appellant/ accused is nothing but a story created at a later stage by the Prosecution, not supported by cogent evidence.

29. In the case on hand, while scrutinizing the evidence, both oral and documentary, as has been discussed above, it came to light that there is no evidence let in by the Prosecution to prove that the appellant/ accused has committed dowry death of the deceased and the deceased was subjected to cruelty or harassment by the appellant/ accused or his relatives and that such cruelty or harassment was for or in connection with any demand for dowry and such cruelty or harassment was soon before her death.

30. Now, adverting to the relevant statutory provisions, it may be noticed that cruelty as defined in Section 498A of IPC means any wilful conduct of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health or harassment of the woman with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or on account of failure by them to meet such demand. Section 304B of IPC requires the presence of essential ingredients, as stated above, which in turn requires proof. In the aid of proof of these offences, the presumption is provided in the provisions of Sections 113B as also under Section 114 of the evidence Act, which reads as under:-

“113B:- Presumption as to dowry death. When the question is whether a person has committed the dowry death of a woman and it is shown that soon before her death such woman has been subjected by such person to cruelty or harassment for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, the court shall presume that such person had caused the dowry death.
Explanation. For the purposes of this section “dowry death” shall http://www.judis.nic.in have the same meaning as in section 304B, of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860)..
114. Court may presume existence of certain facts:- The Court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.”
31. When the Prosecution fails to prove by way of reliable evidence the essential requirements for raising a presumption under Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, that soon before death, the deceased was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or by his relatives for or in connection with the demand of dowry, the provision of Section 304B of IPC and Section 113 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 cannot be attracted to hold that the husband is guilty of offence of dowry death in terms of Section 498A of IPC, as has been held in the cases of Harjit Singh Vs. State of Punjab [AIR-2006-SC-680] and Narayanamoorthy Vs. State of Karnataka and another [2008-2-MLJ-Crl-969-SC] .

32. In the cases of Kamesh Panjiyar alias Kamlesh Panjiyar Vs. State of Bihar [2005-2-SCC-388], Ram Badan Sharma Vs. State of Bihar with Surya Kant Sharma Vs. State of Bihar [2006-10-SCC-115], Kailash Vs. State of MP [2006-12-SCC-667], the Honourable Supreme Court reiterated and reasserted the settled principles laid down in the case of Hira Lal and others Vs. State (Government of NCT), Delhi [2003-8-SCC-80], wherein the essential ingredients to attract application under Section 304B are stated.

33. In the case of Shamlal Vs. State of Haryana [1997-SCC-Crl-759], it was held that it is imperative to prove that soon before her death, the wife was subjected to cruelty and harassment in connection with the demand for dowry and in the absence of such evidence, the accused cannot be convicted under Section 304B of IPC.

34. The Honourable Supreme Court in the case of Satvir Singh and others Vs. State of Punjab and another with Tejinder Pal Kaur Vs. State of Punjab and others [2002-SCC-Crl-48], has clearly laid down that the 'dowry' mentioned in Section 304B of IPC should be construed as any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given in connection with the marriage and customary payments in connection with the birth of a child or other ceremonies, which are prevalent in different societies cannot be enveloped with the ambit of 'dowry'. At paragraphs 20 and 21 of the said decision, it is held as below:-

""20. Prosecution, in a case of offence under Section 304-B IPC cannot escape from the burden of proof that the harassment or cruelty was related to the demand for dowry and also that such cruelty or harassment was caused ""soon before her death"". The word ""dowry"" in Section 304-B has to be understood as it is defined in Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. That definition reads thus:
""2. In this Act, 'dowry' means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly -
(a) by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage; or
(b) by the parents of either party to a marriage or by any other person, to either party to the marriage or to any other person;
at or before or any time after the marriage in connection with the marriage of the said parties, but does not include dower or mahr in the case or persons to whom the Muslim personal law (Shariat) applies.""

21. Thus, there are three occasions related to dowry. One is before the marriage, second is at the time of marriage and the third is ""at any time"" after the marriage. The third occasion may appear to be an unending period. But the crucial words are ""in connection with the marriage of the said parties"". This means that giving or agreeing to give any property or valuable security on any of the above three stages should have been in connection with the marriage of the parties. There can be many other instances for payment of money or giving property as between the spouses. For example, some customary payments in connection with birth of a child or other ceremonies are prevalent in different societies. Such payments are http://www.judis.nic.in not enveloped within the ambit of ""dowry"". Hence the dowry mentioned in Section 304-B should be any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given in connection with the marriage.""

35. In 2017 1 SCC 101 (Baijnath and Others V. State of Madhya Pradesh) , it was laid down that mere factum of unnatural death in matrimonial home within seven years of marriage is not sufficient to convict the accused under Sections 304B and 498A of IPC and that only when the Prosecution proves beyond doubt that the deceased was subjected to cruelty/harassment in connection with dowry demand soon before her death, the legal presumption under Section 113B can be invoked.

36. In 2013 3 SCC 684 (Vipin Jaiswal Vs. State of AP) relied on by the learned counsel for the appellant, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has laid that the Prosecution is required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was subjected to cruelty or harassment by the accused and that the onus was on the Prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the ingredients of Sections 498A and 304B of IPC and that since the Prosecution was not able to prove the same, set aside the impugned judgement of conviction and sentence.

37. In the case on hand, examining the relevant evidence as aforesaid, for the purpose of application of aforesaid statutory provisions, regarding the cause of death of the deceased, the evidence led by the Prosecution is not definite and there is every room for doubt. The testimony of the Prosecution witnesses cannot lead to an inference that the Appellant caused harassment driving the deceased to commit suicide. In the absence of direct evidence, the Trial Court has erred in holding that the appellant/accused had driven the deceased to commit suicide. http://www.judis.nic.in

38. The sum and substance of the analysis of the background facts are that there is no reliable evidence to hold that the deceased was harassed within the meaning of Section 498A of IPC. On a scrutiny of the entire evidence, I am of the considered view that the circumstances and instances shown by the Prosecution are far too meagre for reaching the conclusion that the Appellant had subjected her to cruelty or harassed her for or in connection with any demand of dowry. That being so, this Criminal Appeal deserves to be allowed.

39. In the result, this Criminal Appeal is allowed. The impugned judgement of conviction and sentence is set aside. The appellant is acquitted of all the charges levelled against him. The bail bond if any, executed by the appellant, shall stand cancelled. The fine amount, if any, paid by the appellant is ordered to be refunded to him.

Bhupreet Singh vs State Of U.P. And Another,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/163161960/,"Allahabad High Court
Bhupreet Singh vs State Of U.P. And Another on 7 January, 2025
1. Heard Mr. Rajesh Kumar Pal, learned counsel for the applicant, Mr. Amit Singh Chauhan, learned A.G.A. for the State and perused the record.

2. This application u/s 482 Cr.P.C. has been filed by the applicant to quash charge-sheet dated 01.07.2021 and cognizance order dated 01.11.2021 as well as entire proceedings of the Case No. 25926 of 2021 (State Vs. Bhupreet Singh and others), arising out of Case Crime No. 0145 of 2021, under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 354(?) I.P.C. and 3/4 D.P. Act, Police Station Mahila Thana, District Mathura, pending in the court of Civil Judge (J.D.), Fast Track Court (Crime against Women) Judicial Magistrate, Mathura.

3. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that earlier applicant was granted interim bail by order dated 18.03.2024 and was expected to appear before the court concerned for the purpose of mediation. He further submits that as applicant left India, therefore, he could not appear on the next date fixed for the purpose of mediation. He request that in case the applicant moved an application for bail, the same may be decided in accordance with law.

4. Learned A.G.A. opposed the prayer by contending that F.I.R. is of the year 2021, registered under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 354(?) I.P.C. and 3/4 D.P. Act. The applicant is the husband of opposite party no.2 against whom there are specific allegations of harassing the opposite party no.2.

5. It is to be seen that in the present case charge-sheet has been filed on 01.07.2021 and the applicant was summoned vide order dated 01.11.2021. Thereafter the applicant was released on interim bail vide order dated 18.03.2024 and was supposed to appear for the purpose of mediation before the Mediation Centre at District Court. The very purpose of granting interim bail was conditional in order to make it convenient that the applicant to appear before the Mediation Centre at District Court/ court concerned for the purpose of mediation. He has not appeared on the next date and violated the terms and conditions as required while granting interim bail which means that he is absconding and avoiding facing trial. The proceedings of the court concerned have been held up on account of non appearance of the applicants and as such they are fleeing from the process of law without any reasonable cause.

6. ""Fleeing from justice"" refers to the act of accused in evading or avoiding arrest, prosecution, or punishment for a crime. An accused in aforesaid act tries to avoid facing criminal prosecution by often avoiding summons, warrants and other process issued by the court. An accused is legally bound to comply with the summons issued by the court of law except where the process is challenged before the higher forum by the accused. Any person who has been issued process by court of law cannot be permitted to evade the same thereby not permitting the court of law to proceed in the administration of justice. The said act of accused in avoiding the process of court of law without any justification effects the very cause of justice. An accused fleeing from justice without reasonable cause has the effect of stopping/slowing the criminal process of law which effects the cause of speedy justice to the victim or society at large. Non appearance of an accused before the court concerned when the summons has been served (without reasonable explanation for non-appearance) may be indicative of the fact that such accused do not have respect to the process of law.

7. It is important for rule of law to prevail that the criminal trial is completed without delay. Where an accused flees from the process of law and thereby avoids appearing before the court, the very concept of speedy trial is put at peril and justice to the victim is delayed.

8. The supreme court in Vipan Kumar Dhir v. State of Punjab, (2021) 15 SCC 518 has observed that while granting bail, the possibility of the accused to influence prosecution witnesses, fleeing from justice or creating other impediments in the fair investigation, ought not to be overlooked.

9. While considering the question of whether an accused is fleeing from justice, the conduct of the accused in respect of the process of law is required to be considered. In criminal prosecution when the court find material against the accused sufficient for prosecution, the court issues summons or warrants for appearance to the accused for participation in the trial. When the summons or warrants are served on the accused in accordance with law then duty is cast on the accused to appear before the court concerned except where there exists justification for non-appearance of the accused before the accused. An accused who is served with the process of court and fails to appear before the court concerned without any reasonable cause can be said to be fleeing from the process of law.

10. In the present case, the F.I.R. is of the year 2021, no reasonable explanation has been offered by the learned counsel for the applicant for non-appearance of the applicants before the court concerned in pursuance to summons/warrant issued by the court concerned. Learned counsel for the applicants has not shown any facts and circumstances to demonstrate that applicant was not fleeing from process of law or evading justice. In the facts and circumstances the applicant is fleeing from the process of law and evading justice, as such does not deserve any protection in exercise of the extraordinary jurisdiction of this court.

11. The record appended with the petition in itself demonstrates that the applicant is avoiding the proceedings and has not appeared before the court concerned since March, 2024.

12. In view of the facts, it is evident that the applicants have no respect for the proceedings of the court and have remained absent from the court proceedings for a period of about ten months which is indicative of the fact that the applicants are fleeing from the process of law. Therefore, prayer in respect of applicants is refused and the application u/s 482 Cr.P.C. is hereby dismissed.

13. However, it is provided that if the applicant appears and surrenders before the court below and applies for bail, then the bail application of the applicant be considered and decided as expeditiously as possible in accordance with law. The applicant shall cooperate in the trial sincerely without seeking any adjournment.

                                                    JUDGEMENT
1. This Criminal Appeal is filed, against the judgement of conviction and sentence, dated, 31.07.2017, made in SC.No.110 of 2015, by the Sessions Judge, Mahila Court, Salem, convicting and sentencing each of the Appellants/A1 to A5 for the offence under Section 498A of IPC to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for three years and to pay a fine of Rs.2,000/- each, in default to undergo Simple Imprisonment for six months and for the offence under Section 306 of IPC to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for ten years and to pay a fine of Rs.2,000/- each, in default to undergo six months http://www.judis.nic.in Rigorous Imprisonment and ordering the sentences to run concurrently.

2. The case of the Prosecution is as follows:-

a) The Appellant/A1 is the husband of the deceased, Yasodha and the Appellants/A2 and A3 are in laws of the deceased and the Appellants/A4 and A5 are the sister and brother of the Appellant/A1. The deceased and A1 fell in love with each other and due to their relationship, the deceased became pregnant and the parents of the deceased, on coming to know about the same, with the intervention of elders, had performed their marriage 2 ½ years prior to the occurrence and thereafter, the deceased was living with A1 along with A2 to A5 as a joint family.
b) After marriage, the Appellants/Accused used to often subject the deceased to cruelty by harassing and abusing her, by demanding dowry.
Due to the harassment, the deceased underwent miscarriage and fell ill. Even then, the Appellants/Accused subjected the deceased to cruelty for not meeting out their demand of dowry. On 9.2.2013, A2 to A5 some time prior to 8.15 a.m. had threatened the deceased saying that if she failed to meet out their demand of dowry, they would perform the marriage of A1 with another girl and saying so, A1 had also threatened the deceased several times over phone prior to 9.2.2013. By such willful acts, the Appellants drove the deceased to commit suicide by consuming oleander seeds, which is a poisonous substance, on 9.2.2013 at about 8.15 and the deceased died on 9.2.2013 at 7.00 p.m. within seven years of her marriage in the Hospital. Hence, the Inspector of Police, Kondalampatty, Salem had laid the charge sheet against the http://www.judis.nic.in Appellants/A1 to A5 for the offences under Sections 498A, 306 and 304B of IPC

3. The case was taken on file in PRC.No.4 of 2015, by the Additional Mahila Judge, Salem and after furnishing necessary copies to the accused under Section 207 of Cr.PC, the case was committed to the Court of Sessions. The Principal District Judge, Salem had assigned SC.No.110 of 2015 and made over the case to the Sessions Judge, Mahila Court and charges were framed against the accused under Sections 498A, 306 and 304B of IPC. The substances of the charges were put forth to the accused and they were questioned. The accused had denied the charges and sought for trial. In order to bring home the charges against the accused, the prosecution examined PW.1 to PW.14 and also marked Exs.P1 to P22.

4. On completion of the evidence on the side of the prosecution, the accused were questioned under Section 313 Cr.PC as to the incriminating circumstances found in the evidence of prosecution witnesses and the accused have come with the version of total denial and stated that they have been falsely implicated in this case. On the side of the defence, Ex.D1 was marked and the Appellant/A1 was examined as DW.1. The court below, after hearing the arguments advanced on either side and also looking into the materials available on record, found the Appellants/Accused guilty and awarded punishments, as referred to above, which is challenged in this Criminal Appeal.

5. This court heard the submissions of the learned counsel on either side.

6. The learned counsel for the Appellants would submit that the Trial Court http://www.judis.nic.in erred in convicting the Appellants/Accused when though PW.1, father and PW.2 mother of the deceased have initially supported the case of the in their examination in chief, but in their cross examination, they have not supported the case of the Prosecution and that it is the clear cut case of PW.2 that the deceased committed suicide by consuming oleander seeds due to frequent stomach pain and that even at the earliest point of time, when the deceased was admitted in the Government Hospital, Salem, and examined by PW.14 Doctor, she did not implicate the accused and that till the death of the victim, the Respondent did not take any steps despite the fact that Ex.P22 accident intimation was sent by PW.14 Doctor to the Police immediately. He would further submit that the Trial Court also failed to take into consideration the delay in lodging the complaint by PW.1 and further, the Trial Court did not take into consideration the admission of PW.2 that the deceased consumed poison at her maternal house due to stomach pain.

7. The learned counsel for the Appellants/Accused would further submit that the Trial Court erred in convicting the Appellants/Accused based on Ex.P8, statement and opinion of the Revenue Divisional Officer, which was not supported by the Prosecution witnesses during the course of trial and further, the Trial Court committed a grave error in basing conviction based on 164 statements recorded from the independent witnesses, who have not been examined before the Court. He would further submit that the statement recorded under Section 164 of Cr.PC cannot be treated as a substantive evidence adduced before the Trial Court because it was not recorded in the presence of the accused and that the Prosecution has failed to prove its http://www.judis.nic.in case beyond all reasonable doubts that the Appellants abetted the victim to commit suicide and that when there is no evidence to prove that the Appellants demanded any dowry or that the deceased was subjected to cruelty on account of demand of dowry, the Trial Court erred in convicting the Appellants for the offence under Section 498A of IPC.

8. The learned counsel for the Appellants would further submit that PW.1 and PW.2 are none other than the father and mother of the victim and that PW.1 has categorically deposed that he had deposed in chief only on being tutored by the Police and that even at the time of RDO enquiry and examination before the Magistrate, he had deposed as tutored by the Respondent Police. He would further submit that PW.2 mother of the victim was examined in chief on the same day of examination of PW.1 and she had deposed that prior to the marriage, the victim and the Appellant/A1 had sexual relationship and that she became pregnant and that they are relatives and thereby she had got the victim and the Appellant/A1 married against the wish of her husband, PW.1 and that his daughter, the deceased used to suffer stomach pain often, due to which she had delivered a still born child and that her daughter unable to bear the stomach pain, had committed suicide by consuming oleander seeds poison. He would further submit that PW.1 father was actually antagonised with the Police since the marriage was conducted by PW.2 against his will and thereafter, due to antagonise, they had deposed falsely, however, during the cross examination, he has also admitted that he has not supported the case of the Prosecution and he had stated that he had deposed on being tutored by the Respondent Police and that even as per http://www.judis.nic.in Ex.P7, in column 4, PW.1, mother of the deceased and sister of the deceased were said to have seen the victim alive lastly and that it is the statement of PW.2 that her daughter committed suicide by consuming poison since she was unable to bear the stomach pain

9. The learned counsel for the Appellants would further submit that the RDO enquiry has not been conducted in accordance with the procedure and that Ex.P8 is the joint statement recorded from PW.1 and PW.2, which contains finger prints of PW.1 and PW.2, based on which the joint statement was stated to have been recorded from PW.1 and PW.2, which creates a grave doubt with regard to the manner in which the RDO enquiry was conducted and further though the independent witnesses have been examined during the RDO enquiry, they were not examined before the Court and that in the absence of valid and cogent evidence in support of the Prosecution, the Trial Court erred in convicting and sentencing the Appellants on the uncorroborated evidence and the evidence of PW.1 and PW.2, who have not supported the case of the Prosecution and that the Trial Court also erred in convicting the Appellants based on 164 statements and he would seek for allowing this criminal. In support of his contentions, he would rely on the decisions reported in 2016 2 MWN Cr. 356 Division Bench (Ramasamy Vs. State) and 2013 2 LW Crl. 169 (R.Palanisamy Vs. Inspector of Police).

10.On the other hand, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the Respondent would submit that though PW.1 has rescinded from his earlier statement, he had categorically deposed about the cruelty suffered by his daughter and the demand of dowry and that the Prosecution has proved its http://www.judis.nic.in case beyond all reasonable doubts by cogent evidence and would seek for dismissal of this criminal.

11.I have given my careful and anxious consideration to the rival contentions put forward by either side and thoroughly scanned through the entire evidence available on record and also perused the impugned judgement of conviction.

12.Though the Appellants/Accused were tried for the offences under Sections 498A, 304B and 306 of IPC, the Trial Court, while acquitting the Appellants/Accused under Sections 304B of IPC, had convicted and sentenced them for the offences under Sections 498A and 306 of IPC, as stated above.

13.The main grounds of attack by the learned counsel for the Appellants are that there was a delay in registration the First Information Report and in reaching the inquest report to the Court and that PW.1 and PW.2, who are the father and mother of the deceased have not supported the case of the Prosecution and that the statements recorded under Section 164 of Cr.PC cannot be taken into consideration as a substantive evidence to base conviction.

14.The points that arise for consideration are as to whether the Prosecution has proved its case beyond all reasonable doubts and whether the Trial Court is justified in convicting and sentencing the Appellants/ accused for the offences under Sections 498A and 306 of IPC, as stated above, for which purpose, the oral and documentary are analysed in brief in the following paragraphs.

http://www.judis.nic.in

15.Before analysing the evidence, at this juncture, for easy reference, Section 498A of IPC is extracted as under:-

“498A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty.—Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be pun- ished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.
Explanation.—For the purpose of this section, “cruelty” means—
(a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or
(b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.”
16.It is seen from the above said provisions of Section 498 of IPC, the term “cruelty” has to be narrated as under:-

1. A women must be married
2. She must be subjected to cruelty.
3. Cruelty must be of the nature of harassment of such woman, (a) any willful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide and (b) with a view to coercing her to meet unlawful demand for property or valuable security or is on account of failure to meet such demand.
17.Further, to bring home the guilt of the Appellants/ accused for the offence under Section 306 of IPC, the Prosecution should prove that there has to be a clear mens rea to commit an offence and that there ought to be an active or direct act leading the deceased to commit suicide, being left with no option.

18.In the case on hand, the date of occurrence, i.e. consuming poison by the deceased, is 9.2.2013 at 8.15 hours. The deceased died on the same day at 7.00 p.m. in the hospital.

Ex.P13 to Ex.P17 are the statements of the witnesses recorded under Section 164 of Cr.PC. Ex.P18 dated 10.02.2013 is the accident register copy and Ex.P19 dated 9.2.2013 is the accident register. Ex.P20 dated 9.2.2013 is the intimation to the Police. Ex.P21 dated 9.2.2013 is the accident register copy. Ex.P22 is the admission sheet, dated 9.2.2013.

22.DW.1 is the Appellant/A1 and Ex.D1 dated 14.3.2016 is the Government quarters allotment order copy to the accused.

23.In the chief examination, PW.1, father of the deceased had deposed about the cruelty meted out to the deceased by the Appellants, but in his cross examination, he had deposed that he had deposed in chief only on being tutored by the Police and that even at the time of preliminary enquiry, RDO enquiry and examination before the Magistrate, he had deposed as tutored by the Respondent Police to make such a statement and that the deceased and the Appellant/A1 were living happily after their marriage and his daughter frequently suffered stomach pain, due to which, she consumed oleander seeds. Thus, it is seen that PW.1, father of the deceased, though in the chief examination, has supported the case of the Prosecution, but in his cross examination had deposed totally against the Prosecution and not supported the case of the Prosecution and as such, in the opinion of this Court, the evidence of PW.1 should not have been relied on by the Trial Court to base conviction.

http://www.judis.nic.in

24.PW.1 had been examined in chief on 5.3.2016 and on the same day, PW.2 mother of the victim had been examined and treated as a hostile witness and she had deposed that prior to the marriage, the victim and the Appellant/A1 had sexual relationship and that she became pregnant and that they are relatives and thereby she had got the victim and the Appellant/A1 married against the wish of her husband, PW.1. She had even in her chief examination stated about the reason for her daughter having committed suicide due to frequent stomach pain suffered by her. Even though PW.2 had been subjected to lengthy cross examination by the Prosecution, she stood by her deposition that her daughter committed suicide due to severe stomach pain. Even as per Ex.P7, in column 4, PW.1, mother of the deceased and sister of the deceased were said to have seen the victim alive lastly. Thus, the PW.2 has also not supported the case of the Prosecution. It is also seen from the evidence of PW.3 and PW.4, mahazar witnesses that they have not supported the case of the Prosecution.

25.Further, immediately after the occurrence, the victim had been taken to the Government Moran Kumaramangalam Medical College and Hospital, Salem and she was examined by PW.12 Doctor. At the time of admission, she was conscious and that she had not made any allegations against her husband or his relatives. Even at the time of initial admission on 9.2.2013 at 10.30 a.m. intimation had been given to the Police and thereafter, referred to Vinayaga Mission Kirubananda Variyar Medical College and Hospital for better treatment on the same day evening at 5.00 p.m. and even from there, intimation had been given to the Respondent Police and thereafter, she had http://www.judis.nic.in not responded to the treatment and she died on the same day at 7.00 p.m and death intimation had been sent to the Respondent Police.

26.Though Ex.P2, death intimation report was sent to the Respondent Police on 9.2.2013 at 7.00 p.m., the Respondent Police had not registered the case immediately. Only on 10.02.2013 at 10.00 a.m. on receipt of the Ex.P1 complaint from PW.1, PW.7 Investigating Officer had registered the case under Section 174(iii) of Cr.PC. Further, though PW.9, Revenue Divisional Officer had sent the inquest report under Ex.P7 to the Court on 10.02.2013, the Court and signature were put on Ex.P7 only on 28.03.2013. Thus, there was an inordinate delay of about 47 days in reaching the inquest report to the Court, which remains unexplained by the Prosecution. Further, the first complaint based on death intimation was suppressed by the Respondent Police. There is no plausible explanation given by the Prosecution for the delay in registering the First Information Report and in reaching the inquest report to the Court, which is fatal to the case of the Prosecution.

27.Now coming to the conviction under Section 498A of IPC, though Section 113 A of the Indian Evidence Act, imposes the presumption as to the abatement of suicide by a married woman, to invoke such presumption, the prosecution has to establish by evidence that the victim was subjected to cruelty. Though a presumption could be drawn, the burden of showing that such an offence has been committed by the accused under Section 498 A of IPC is on the prosecution.

28. As stated above, on reading of the entire evidence, though there may seem to be allegations against the Appellant/A1 for having caused cruelty on the http://www.judis.nic.in victim, in the opinion of this Court, there is not even an iota of evidence, much less valid and cogent evidence, let in by the Prosecution to attract the ingredients of Section 498A of IPC and that the conduct of the Appellants/Accused cannot be termed as “cruelty” under Section 498A of IPC. Therefore, the conviction under Section 498 A of IPC cannot be sustained.

29.With regard to case of abetment to commit suicide, the Honourable Supreme Court in (2017) 1 SCC 433 (Gurucharan Singh Vs State of Punjab), in Paras 20 to 22 and Paras 27 to 29, has held as follows:-

“20. Section 306 of the Code prescribes the punishment for abetment of suicide and is designed thus:
“306.Abetment of suicide. – If any person commits suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.”
21. It is thus manifest that the offence punishable is one of abetment of the commission of suicide by any person, predicating existence of a live link or nexus between the two, abetment being the propelling causative factor. The basic ingredients of this provision are suicidal death and the abetment thereof. To constitute abetment, the intention and involvement of the accused to aid or instigate the commission of suicide is imperative. Any severance or absence of any of this constituents would militate against this indictment. Remoteness of the culpable acts or omissions rooted in the intention of the accused to actualize the suicide would fall short as well of the offence of abetment essential to attract the punitive mandate of Section 306 IPC.
Contiguity, continuity, culpability and complicity of the indictable acts or omission are the concomitant indices of abetment. Section 306 IPC, thus criminalises the sustained incitement for suicide.

22.Section 107 IPC defines abetment and is extracted hereunder:-

http://www.judis.nic.in “107. Abetment of a thing. – A person abets the doing of a thing, who – First – Instigates any person to do that thing; or Secondly – Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing; or Thirdly – Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.
Explanation 1 – A person, who by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures or attempts to cause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that doing.
Explanation 2 – Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitate the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.” Not only the acts and omissions defining the offence of abetment singularly or in combination are enumerated therein, the explanations adequately encompass all conceivable facets of the culpable conduct of the offender relatable thereto.” *********
27. The pith and purport of Section 306 IPC has since been enunciated by this Court in Randhir Singh vs. State of Punjab (2004)13 SCC 129, and the relevant excerpts therefrom are set out hereunder:-
“12. Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding that person in doing of a thing. In cases of conspiracy also it would involve that mental process of entering into conspiracy for the doing of that thing. More active role which can be described as instigating or aiding the doing of a thing is required before a person can be said to be abetting the commission of offence under Section 306 IPC.
13. In State of W.B. Vs. Orilal Jaiswal (1994) 1 SCC 73, this Court has observed that the courts should be extremely careful in assessing the facts and circumstances of each case and the evidence adduced in the trial for the purpose of http://www.judis.nic.in finding whether the cruelty meted out to the victim had in fact induced her to end the life by committing suicide. If it transpires to the court that a victim committing suicide was hypersensitive to ordinary petulance, discord and differences in domestic life quite common to the society to which the victim belonged and such petulance, discord and differences were not expected to induce a similarly circumstanced individual in a given society to commit suicide, the conscience of the court should not be satisfied for basing a finding that the accused charged of abetting the offence of suicide should be found guilty.”
28. Significantly, this Court underlined by referring to its earlier pronouncement in Orilal Jaiswal (supra) that courts have to be extremely careful in assessing the facts and circumstances of each case to ascertain as to whether cruelty had been meted out to the victim and that the same had induced the person to end his/her life by committing suicide, with the caveat that if the victim committing suicide appears to be hypersensitive to ordinary petulance, discord and differences in domestic life, quite common to the society to which he or she belonged and such factors were not expected to induce a similarly circumstanced individual to resort to such step, the accused charged with abetment could not be held guilty. The above view was reiterated in Amalendu Pal @ Jhantu vs. State of West Bengal(2010) 1 SCC 707.
29. That the intention of the legislature is that in order to convict a person under Section 306 IPC, there has to be a clear mens rea to commit an offence and that there ought to be an active or direct act leading the deceased to commit suicide, being left with no option, had been propounded by this Court in S.S. Chheena vs. Vijay Kumar Mahajan (2010) 12 SCC 190.”
30.Before Section 306 of IPC can be acted upon, there must be clear proof of the fact that the death in question was a suicidal death. The offence of 'abetment' must conform to the definition of that term as given in Section 107 of IPC, that is to say, there must be instigation, cooperation or intentional assistance given to the commission of suicide. It is not necessary or indeed is it a part of the definition. The suicide should have been committed in http://www.judis.nic.in consequence of the abetment. In order to render a person liable as an abettor, it is, of course, necessary, as indeed it is in the case of any other offence, that the abettor should do something more than a mute spectator.
Thereby, without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained.

31.In this case, the essential ingredients of Section 306 of IPC for abetment have not been proved. There is no instigation to drive the deceased to commit suicide on the part of the Appellants. There is no material to show the cruelty meted out by the deceased.

32. In (2010) 1 MWN (cr.) 310 M.Sathishkumar V. State of Tamil Nadu, it was held as under:-

“6. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that even if the allegations made against the petitioner/accused are accepted to be true, even then, there is no possibility for holding the petitioner guilty of the charges either under Section 498-A or 306, I.P.C. He further submits that all the facts spoken to by the witnesses would only indicate the misunderstanding between the husband and wife and there was no love lost. Apart from that, according to the learned Senior Counsel, there is no evidence to show that the petitioner abetted the commission of offence as defined in Section 107, I.P.C. To substantiate the said contention, the learned Senior Counsel has taken me through the oral evidences and Ex.P2. He has also relied on the judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in Kishangiri Mangalgiri Goswami v. State of Gujarat, 2009 (4) MLJ (Crl) 983, wherein, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had occasion to hold as to what constitute ‘abetment of suicide’ as contemplated under Section 306, I.P.C. in terms of Section 107, I.P.C. In para 11 to 13 read as follows:-
“11Section 107, I.P.C. defines abetment of a thing. The offence of abetment is a separate and distinct offence provided in the Act as an offence. A person, abets the doing of a thing when (1) he instigates any person to do that thing; or (2) engages with one or more other persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing; or (3) intentionally aids, by act or illegal omission, the doing of that http://www.judis.nic.in thing. These things are essential to complete abetment as a crime. The word “instigate” literally means to provoke, incite, urge on or bring about by persuasion to do anything. The abetment may be by instigation, conspiracy or intentional aid, as provided in the three clauses of Section 107. Section 109 provides that if the act abetted is committed in consequence of abetment and there is no provision for the punishment of such abetment, then the offender is to be punished with the punishment provided for the original offence. ‘Abetted’ in Section 109 means the specific offence abetted. Therefore, the offence for the abetment of which a person is charged with the abetment is normally linked with the proved offence.
12. In cases of alleged abetment of suicide, there must be proof of direct or indirect acts of incitement to the commission of suicide.
The mere fact that the husband treated the deceased-wife cruelty is not enough. See Mahinder Singh v. State of M.P., 1995 AIR SCW 4570.

13. The aforesaid aspects were highlighted in Kishori Lal v. State of M.P., 2007 (10) SCC 797: 2007 (2) MLJ (Crl) 1830; Randhir Singh and another v. State of Punjab, AIR 2004 SC 5097: 2005 SCC (Cr) 56: 2004 (13) SCC 129; and Sohan Raj Sharma v. State of Haryana, Criminal Appeal No. 1464 of 2007 disposed of on 7.4.2008”.

7. A close look into the above would show that it is crystal clear that unless it is established by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt that there was either direct or indirect act of inducement to the commission of suicide, the mere fact that the husband treated the deceased wife with cruelty is not at all enough to convict, the accused under Section 306, I.P.C. In the case on hand, the witnesses, P.Ws. 1 to 3, 5, 6 have spoken only about what the deceased/D1 told them. They have only spoken that on several occasions either by phone or in person, the deceased/D1 told them that she was subjected to harassment by her husband. Except such vague statement, nothing more is found to satisfy the ingredients under Section 107, I.P.C. The learned Senior Counsel further submits that the allegations which were spoken by the witnesses do not find a place in the earlier report of the Revenue Divisional Officer. The said omission has also been established by way of contradictions and so much weightage cannot be given to the evidence of these witnesses.

8. In my opinion, the evidence of these witnesses would indicate that, the deceased/D1 was harassed by the accused as there was misunderstanding between them. This will not constitute abetment http://www.judis.nic.in as defined under Section 107, I.P.C. and therefore, the conviction under Section 306, I.P.C. cannot be sustained at all.

9. Now so far as the question of conviction under Section 498-A, I.P.C. is concerned, here, the term “Cruelty” has been explained in Section 498-A, I.P.C. as follows:

(a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or
(b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.
10. The learned Government Advocate (Criminal Side) would submit that the act of the accused would fall within the Explanation (a) to Section 498-A, I.P.C. But, I am not persuaded by the said argument. In my considered opinion, a close look into the evidences of P.Ws. 1 to 3, 5 and 6 would go to show that though the conduct of the petitioner would amount to harassment, the same would not fall within the definition of cruelty in terms of Section 498-A, I.P.C. since the conduct of the petitioner was not in the nature of likely to drive the deceased to commit suicide. As I have already stated, misunderstanding between the husband and wife and the consequent domestic quarrels cannot be termed as “Cruelty” in terms of Section 498-A, I.P.C. Therefore, the conviction under Section 498-A, I.P.C. also cannot be sustained.”

33.With regard to the conduct of the Revenue Divisional Officer Enquiry, Ex.P8 is the joint statement recorded from PW.1 and PW.2, which contains finger prints of PW.1 and PW.2, based on which the joint statement was stated to have been recorded, which creates a grave doubt with regard to the manner in which the RDO enquiry was conducted. Further, though the independent witnesses have been examined during the RDO enquiry, they were not examined before the Court. In the absence of valid evidence in support of the Prosecution, the Trial Court erred in convicting and sentencing the http://www.judis.nic.in Appellants on the uncorroborated evidence and the evidence of PW.1 and PW.2, who have not supported the case of the Prosecution.

34.With regard to placing reliance on Ex.P8, statement and RDO opinion, when none of the witnesses have supported the case of the prosecution before the trial Court, the statement given before the Revenue Divisional Officer can only be taken as a statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.PC during the course of investigation and without the statements having been corroborated, the report of the Revenue Divisional Officer cannot be relied on.

35.In Gunasekaran V. State by the Inspector of Police, Perambalur Police Station reported in (2017) 1 L.W (Crl) 88, it has been held as follows :

“41. A statement given by a witness to a Revenue Divisional officer under Section 176 r/w Section 174 Cr.P.C. is also a 'previous statement'. It is not a 'Substantive piece of evidence'. Because it is not recorded before the Trial Court on oath. It is recorded 'elsewhere'. It is recorded outside the Court, namely, before the R.D.O. It is also like a statement given to a Police Officer during inquest under Section 174 Cr.P.C. The only difference is instead of a Police Officer a Revenue Official conducts the inquest and the inquiry thereon. After his enquiry, the R.D.O submits his (inquest) report.
42. In Kuldip Singh vs. State of Punjab [AIR 1992 SC 1944 = 1992 Crl.LJ 3592] the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that although the contents of the inquest report cannot be treated as evidence, it can be looked into to test the veracity of the witnesses.
43. Statement given to R.D.O. can be used by the defence to contradict the witness because it is also a previous statement. The Court cannot mark a police statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. equally, the Court cannot mark a statement given to the R.D.O. Under certain circumstances, they can be marked as defence exhibit.
44. The danger of marking, admitting statement given to a R.D.O. in evidence is that the mind of the Court will be prejudiced. And a statement not given before the Court being introduced in the evidence. A statement given to police during investigation under http://www.judis.nic.in Section 161 Cr.P.C. is not marked. Likewise, a statement given to R.D.O. also should not be marked.”
36.Further, PW.1 had rescinded from Ex.P1, the statement given to the Police, based on which, Ex.P2, First Information Report was registered. As stated above, all the witnesses including the relatives and the Panchayatars, who have been examined by the Revenue Divisional Officer, have turned hostile and they have not supported the case of the Prosecution. When such being so, the report of the RDO based on the statement given by the witnesses who have turned hostile in Court, cannot be taken as substantive piece of evidence.

37.Further, the Trial Court had also placed reliance on Ex.P13 to Ex.P17, statements recorded under Section 164 of Cr.PC by the Magistrate. Now, what is to be seen is as to the use, value and objective behind such statements, what is their nature, whether it can be used against the accused and whether it can be used by the accused in his favour. In this regard, it is apposite to refer to the decision of the Division Bench of this Court reported in 2013 2 LW Crl. 169 (R.Palanisamy Vs. Inspector of Police), wherein it was held as under:-

“”2.It is relevant here to note the aspects relating to the recording of statement of witnesses contained in Section 164 Cr.P.C., they runs as under :
""164. Recording of confessions and statements. (1) Any Metropolitan Magistrate or Judicial Magistrate may, whether or not he has jurisdiction in the case, record any confession or statement made to him in the course of an investigation under this Chapter or under any other law for the time being in force, or at any time http://www.judis.nic.in afterwards before the commencement of the inquiry or trial:
Provided further x x x x x x x x (2) x x x x x (3) x x x x x (4) x x x x x (5) Any statement other than a confession made under sub-section (1) shall be recorded in such manner hereinafter provided for the recording of evidence as is, in the opinion of the Magistrate, best fitted to the circumstances of the case; and the Magistrate shall have power to administer oath to the person whose statement is so recorded.
(6) The Magistrate recording a confession or statement under this section shall forward it to the Magistrate by whom the case is to be inquired into or tried.""
66. We have carefully perused the entire oral and documentary evidence let in by the prosecution in this case. Only legally permissible evidence shall go to the record of evidence. The evidence which cannot be admitted shall not form part of the record of evidence. For instance, hearsay evidence shall not go into the record of evidence. So also the evidence of witness, which is against the prosecution version of the case, disowned statement of a witness recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C., shall not become record of evidence.

38.In AIR 1972 SC 468 (Ram Kishan Singh Vs. Harmit Kaur), it had been held that a statement under Section 164 of Cr.PC is not a substantive evidence.

39.A statement given by a witness under Section 164 of Cr.PC is like a 'previous statement' given during the investigation under Section 161 of Cr.PC. It is not a substantive evidence adduced before the Trial Judge, because it was not recorded in the presence of the accused and because , it was recorded – 'res inter alios acta' – recorded behind the back of the http://www.judis.nic.in accused and because it was recorded from a witness during the investigation.

40.In this case, when the statements under Section 164 of Cr.PC were marked, which have not been recorded before the Sessions Judge, but recorded before the Magistrate, at a time when the accused was not in picture, became part of the records, then the Trial Court should not have relied on such statements to base its conviction and there is the danger of the Trial Court using them as substantive evidence.

41.On analysis of the entire evidence and in the light of the decisions cited supra, this Court is of the firm opinion that the Prosecution has failed to prove the charges against the the Appellants beyond reasonable doubts and that none of the basis chosen by the Trial Court to convict the Appellants has the sanction of law and the Trial Court erred in convicting the Appellants placing reliance on the untested statement recorded by PW.9, Revenue Divisional Officer and exhibits and placing reliance on the statement recorded under Section 164 of Cr.PC from the witnesses, more particularly, when the other independent witnesses, from whom the statement under Section 161 of Cr.PC had been recorded, have not been examined before the Court and thus, the Prosecution has miserably failed to prove the guilt of the Appellants/accused under Sections 498A and 306 of IPC and hence, conviction and sentence under Sections 498A and 306 of IPC is not sustainable and consequently, the Appellants are entitled for acquittal.

42.In the result, this Criminal Appeal is allowed. The impugned judgement of conviction and sentence is set aside. The Appellants are acquitted of the http://www.judis.nic.in charges levelled against them. The bail bond if any executed by them shall stand cancelled and the fine amount if any paid by them shall be refunded to them.

Mr Priya G Fernandes vs State Of Karnataka,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/78609676/,"Karnataka High Court
Mr Priya G Fernandes vs State Of Karnataka on 7 January, 2025
The petitioner-accused No.3 is before this Court seeking grant of anticipatory bail in Crime No.3/2024 of Kaggalupura Police Station, pending in CC.No.3359/2024 on the file of the learned II Additional CJM, Bangalore, registered for the offences punishable under Sections 498A and 304(B) R/w Section 34 of Indian Penal Code (for short 'IPC'), on the basis of the first information lodged by the informant Kevan V Dsouza.


2. Heard Smt. Seethal S, learned counsel for the petitioner and Smt. K.P.Yashodha, learned High Court Government Pleader for the respondent-State. Perused the materials on record.


3. In view of the rival contentions urged by the learned counsel for both the parties, the point that would arise for my consideration is:


""Whether the petitioner is entitled for grant of bail under Section 438 of Cr.P.C.?""
NC: 2025:KHC:245 My answer to the above point is in 'Affirmative' for the following:


REASONS
4. Petitioner being accused No.3 is seeking anticipatory bail on the apprehension of being arrested. She is the sister of accused No.1 and daughter of accused No.2. Accused No.1 is the husband of the deceased and their marriage was performed on 29.12.2018. The deceased committed suicide by hanging in the house of accused No.1 on 04.01.2024. Brother of the deceased lodged the first information alleging ill-treatment to the deceased by accused Nos.1 to 4. Petitioner and accused No.4 are the sisters of accused No.1. Investigation is completed and the charge sheet is filed.

5. On perusal of the first information and even according to the charge sheet, except stating that the petitioner being the sister of accused No.1, demanded additional dowry and ill-treated the deceased both physically and mentally forcing her to commit suicide, there are no instances, which requires the petitioner for custodial interrogation. Admittedly, accused Nos.1 and 2 are already enlarged on bail. Accused NC: 2025:KHC:245 No.4 is said to be in abroad. It is not the contention of the prosecution that the petitioner is required for further investigation. Considering all these facts and circumstances, I am of the opinion that the petitioner may be granted anticipatory bail subject to conditions, which will take care of the interest of the prosecution.


6. Accordingly, I answer the above point in the affirmative and proceed to pass the following:

ORDER The petition is allowed.
The petitioner is ordered to be enlarged on bail in the event of her arrest in Crime No.3/2024 of Kaggalupura Police Station, pending in CC.No.3359/2024 on the file of the learned II Additional CJM, Bangalore, registered for the offences punishable under Sections 498A and 304(B) R/w Section 34 of IPC.
The petitioner is directed to appear before the Investigating Officer within 15 days from the date of receipt of this order and on her appearance, the Investigating Officer shall enlarge her on bail subject to the following conditions:-
a. The petitioner shall furnish the bond in a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakhs only) NC: 2025:KHC:245 with two sureties for the likesum to the satisfaction of the Investigating Officer;
b. The petitioner shall not commit similar offences;
c. The petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer or the court as and when required; and d. The petitioner shall not threaten or tamper the prosecution witnesses.
On furnishing the sureties by the petitioner, the Investigating Officer is at liberty to verify the correctness of the address and authenticity of the documents furnished by her. On satisfaction of the said documents, he may proceed to accept the sureties within a reasonable time.

S.Sivakumar vs State Rep.,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/22124708/,"Madras High Court
S.Sivakumar vs State Rep. By on 6 February, 2017
Preface The Appellant / A.1 has focussed the instant Criminal Appeal before this Court as against the Judgment dated 10.03.2014 in S.C.No.116 of 2013 passed by the Learned Sessions Judge, Magalir Neethimandram (Fast Track Court), Erode.

2. The trial Court while passing the impugned Judgment in S.C.No.116 of 2013 on 10.03.2014 at Paragraph 20 had observed that in the result, the 1st Accused (Appellant) was found guilty in respect of an offence under Section 306 of IPC and imposed punishment of three years of Rigorous Imprisonment, besides imposing a fine of Rs.1,10,000/- in default of payment of fine, further one year Simple Imprisonment was imposed. The period already undergone by the 1st Accused (Appellant) was directed to be set of under Section 428 of Cr.P.C., Further, it was ordered that if the fine of Rs.1,10,000/- was paid, from and out of the said amount, a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- was to be deposited in a fixed deposit in any one of the nationalised bank in the name of Arunkumar, rep.by P.W.4 (Sivalingam  Guardian) since the said Arunkumar (a mentally challenged child) was born to the 1st Accused (Appellant) and deceased Rajeswari. In fact, the trial court had acquitted the Appellant (1stAccused) in respect of an offence under Section 498 A and acquitted the 2nd Accused under Sections 498A and 306 of IPC, since the same were not proved beyond reasonable doubt and accordingly the benefit of doubt was given on their favour and ultimately they were acquited under Section 235(1) of Cr.P.C.

3. Challenging the Judgment dated 10.03.2014 in S.C.No. 116 of 2013 passed by the trial court, the Appellant / A.1 has filed the instant Appeal before this Court by taking a plea that the trial court had failed to appreciate the evidence in favour of the Appellant in a proper perspective, which had resulted in a serious miscarriage of justice.

Appellant's Contentions

4. The Learned Counsel for the Appellant urges before this Court that father of the deceased, Rajeswari (P.W.4) in his evidence had stated that the deceased was a brave girl and also she was an intelligent person, but these vital facts were not taken into consideration by the trial court, at the time of passing the Impugned Judgment.

5. The Learned Counsel for the Appellant proceeds to state that there is no iota of evidence on the day of occurrence that the Appellant / A.1 had picked up the quarrel and shouted at the deceased, Rajeswari, as averred by the prosecution.

6.According to the Learned Counsel for the Appellant, the trial court should have seen that P.W.6 (Neighbour) categorically deposed that there was no such cruelty or fight took place at any point of time in the house of the deceased, as alleged by the prosecution.

7.The Learned Counsel for the Appellant brings it to the notice of this Court that the trial court had failed to consider that neither P.W.4, Father and P.W.5, Brother of the deceased had deposed that prior to the alleged occurrence the deceased made any complaint about the particular ill-treatment.

8. It is represented on behalf of the Appellant that the Respondent / Prosecuting agency had failed to establish the allegations of cruelty or ill-treatment or scolding caused to the deceased, Rajeswari at Appellant's instance.

9. Advancing his arguments, the Learned Counsel for the Appellant draws the attention of this Court to the fact that the ocular evidence tendered by the witness on the side of the Respondent / Prosecution were sketchy, unreliable and untrustworthy of acceptance and as such, the 'Judgment of Conviction' rendered by the trial court is clearly unsustainable in the eye of Law.

10. The Learned Counsel for the Appellant contends that the improved version of evidence of P.W.4 and P.W.5 point out that the entire story in regard to the factum of alleged cruelty and behaviour of the Accused towards the deceased was built up during the time of trial (at the time of evidence being recorded before Court) and therefore, no conviction can be made, of course, based on the improved version of the evidence.

11.The Learned Counsel for the Appellant submits that there are material contradictions in regard to the 'Time Of Occurrence' by whom the said fact was noticed and when there were serious discrepancies about by whom the said fact was brought to the knowledge of P.W.1 and then to P.W.2 (Investigation Officer), the trial court should have rejected the prosecution case and resultantly acquitted the Appellant.

12. The Learned Counsel for the Appellant takes an emphatic stand that P.W.1, P.W.2 and P.W.7 had admitted that 'this type of accidental deaths were happening in the railway track and that most of the villagers are using short cut way by crossing railway track to reach Kakkanpalayam from Iyanpalayam'.

13. The Learned Counsel for the Appellant submits that the P.W.4 (Father of deceased, Rajeswari) admitted in his evidence (in cross examination) that his , Rajeswari (deceased) used to walk from Ayyampalayam to Kakkampalayam to board the bus and come to his house and that the distance between Ayyampalayam and Kakkampalayam was nearly 10 Kms. However, the deceased, Rajeswari would take a short cut route by crossing the railway track and by this, Kakkampalayam would be reached at the distance of 2 Kms.

14. The Learned Counsel for the Appellant contends that the alleged uttering of words by the Appellant in a 'fit of anger or emotion' without any intention, do not amount to 'Instigation' and in fact, Rajeswari (since deceased) committed suicide only on account of her depressed mind.

15. It is the submission of the Learned Counsel for the Appellant that when there are significant omissions in the statements of witnesses (recorded under Section 161 of Cr.P.C.,), the ocular evidence as regards the events preceding actual incident rested exclusively on their statement and indeed, an improved version was adduced during the trial. However, these significant aspects were not borne in mind by the trial court at the time of passing the impugned Judgment.

16. Lastly, the Learned Counsel for the Appellant / A.1 winds up his argument by submitting that when glaring omissions were made by the material witnesses and the evidence let in the present case 'is one of' no evidence, then, the trial court ought to have acquitted the Accused instead of convicting the Accused.

24. Apart from the above, the Learned Counsel for the Appellant placed reliance on the following decisions:

a. In the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court between Kishori Lal V. State of M.P. reported in (2007) 10 SCC at Page 797 at Special Page 799 at Paragraph Nos. 6 to 8 it is observed as under:-
 6. Section 107 IPC defines abetment of a thing. The offence of abetment is a separate and distinct offence provided in IPC. A person, abets the doing of a thing when (1) he instigates any person to do that thing; or (2) engages with one or more other persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing; or (3) intentionally aids, by act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing. These things are essential to complete abetment as a crime. The word instigate literally means to provoke, incite, urge on or bring about my persuasion to do any thing. The abetment may be by instigation, conspiracy or intentional aid, as provided in the three clauses of Section 107. Section 109 provides that if the act abetted is committed in consequence of abetment and there is no provision for the punishment of such abetment, then the offender is to be punished with the punishment provided for the original offence. Abetted in Section 109 means the specific offence abetted. Therefore, the offence for the abetment of which a person is charged with the abetment is normally linked with the proved offence.
7. In cases of alleged abetment of suicide there must be proof of direct or indirect acts of incitement to the commission of suicide. The mere fact that the husband treated the deceased wife with cruelty is not enough. (see Mahendra Singh V. State of M.P. (1995 SCC (Cri) 1157)). Mrely on the allegation of harassment conviction in terms of Section 306 IPC is not sustainable. There is ample evidence on record that the deceased was disturbed because she had not given birth to any child. P.Ws 8, 10 and 11 have categorically stated that the deceased was disappointed due to the said fact and her failure to beget a child and she was upset due to this.
8. If the background facts are analysed it is crystal clear that the prosecution has failed to establish its case. That being so, the appeal deserves to be allowed, which we direct.
b. In the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Bhagwan Das V. Kartar Singh and Others ((2007) 11 SCC at Page 205) at Special Page 209 wherein at Paragraph No.12 it is observed as under:-
 12.Similarly, in Mahendra Singh V. State of M.P. (1995 SCC (Cri) 1157) it was observed by this Court that it is common knowledge that the words uttered in a quarrel or in the spur of the moment or in anger cannot be treated as constituting mens rea. In that case the appellant said to the deceased to go and die. As a result of such utterance, the deceased went and committed suicide. However, the Supreme Court observed that no offence under Section 306 read with Section 107 IPC was made out because there was no element of mens rea. c. In the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sohan Raj Sharma V. State of Haryana ((2008) 11 SCC at Page 215) at Special page 218 wherein at Paragraph Nos.13 and 14 it is observed as under:-
13. When the factual scenario is examined, it is clear that the accused has been described as a sexual pervert and that he had behaved like an animal and the deceased had tolerated the insulting manner in which he behaved. They were married in court. It was stated that the accused was impotent and he was trying to defame the deceased for having relationship with ladies.
14. The most significant part of the letter the deceased had written is as follows:
I desired to kill you along with us but no, if you have any sense of shame you will die as a result of sequence of events. But it does not make any difference for shameless person because these abuses will sound as correct if you realise your capacity. You have not spent even eight days in a period of eight years in peace with me. You yourself are responsible for death of these children. Flowers had been prayed for from the dieties of your family regarding whom you disclosed ' they are not mine they are with me from my friend (girl friend) on, you, the condemned the day children will be born as a result of cohabitation of a woman with woman, a woman will stop giving birth to man like you. Above being the factual scenario, it cannot be said that the ingredients of Section 306 IPC have been established. Therefore, the conviction as recorded cannot be maintained. The order of the High Court is set aside. The appellant be released forthwith unless required in connection with other case. d. In the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Amalendu Pal Alias Jhantu V. State of West Bengal ((2010) 1 SCC at Page 707) at Special Page 712 wherein at Paragraph Nos.12 and 13, it is observed as follows:-
12. Thus, this Court has consistently taken the view that before holding an accused guilty of an offence under Section 306 IPC, the Court must scrupulously examine the facts and circumstances of the case and also assess the evidence adduced before it in order to find out whether the cruelty and harassment meted out to the victim had left the victim with no other alternative but to put an end to her life. It is also to be borne in mind that in cases of alleged abetment of suicide there must be proof of direct or indirect acts of incitement to the commission of suicide. Merely on the allegation of harassment without there being any positive action proximate to the time of occurrence on the part of the accused which led or compelled the person to commit suicide conviction in terms of section 306 IPC is not sustainable.
13. In order to bring a case within the purview of Section 306 IPC there must be a case of suicide and in the commission of the said offence, the person who is said to have abetted the commission of suicide must have played an active role by an act of instigation or by doing certain act to facilitate the commission of suicide. Therefore, the act of abetment by the person charged with the said offence be proved and established by the prosecution before he could be convicted under Section 306 IPC. e. In the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Gangula Mohan Reddy V. State of Andhrapradesh ((2010) 1 SCC at Page 750) at Special Page 755 wherein at Paragraph No.17, it is observed as follows:-
17. Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained. The intention of the legislature and the ratio of the cases decided by this Court is clear mens rea to commit the offence. It also requires an active act or direct act which led the deceased to commit suicide seeing no option and this act must have been intended to push the deceased into such a position that he committed suicide. f. In the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in S.S.Chheena V. Vijayakumar Mahajan and Another ((2010) 12 SCC at Page 190) at Special Page 195 wherein at Paragraph No.13 it is mentioned as follows:-
13. The appellant submitted that the main question which arises for adjudication is whether it would be just and fair to compel the appellant to face the rigmarole of a criminal trial in the absence of any credible material against him? According to the appellant, a careful reading of the suicide note clearly leads to the conclusion that the appellant was not even remotely connected with the offence of abetment. When the appellant was in no manner connected with the offence of abetment. When the appellant was in no manner connected with this case and there was no credible material to connect the appellant with the crime, in this view of the matter, according to the appellant, it would be a futile exercise to compel him to undergo the rigmarole of a criminal trial. g. Also in the aforesaid decision at page Nos.197 and 198 at Paragraph Nos.25 and 27, it is observed as under:-
19. After holding as aforesaid, the Court found on facts and especially referring to suicide note that one can infer that the deceased was so possessive of her husband, and was always under an emotional stress that she might lose her husband and that apart she had exonerated the husband and accordingly it would not come within the scope and ambit of Section 306 IPC. Respondent's Submissions

25. Per contra, it is the submission of the Learned Government Advocate (Crl.Side) that, before the trial court in the main case, on behalf of the Respondent / Prosecution, witnesses P.W.1 to P.W.10 were examined and Ex.P.1 to P.11 were marked. As a matter of fact, it is represented on behalf of the Respondent that the trial court on an appreciation of entire available oral and documentary evidences had came to a resultant conclusion that the Appellant / A.1 was guilty in respect of an offence under Section 306 of Indian Penal Code and imposed him necessary punishment, which may not be dislodged by this Court, sitting in Appellate Jurisdiction.

26.To appreciate the factual matrix of the main case, it is useful for this Court to make a pertinent reference to the evidence of witnesses P.W.1 to P.W.10.

36. Continuing further, P.W.5 in his evidence had deposed that he was informed by his sister (who came to his house) that the Appellant / A.1 was keeping one Kerala girl in the house and therefore her sister created a problem for which the Appellant / Accused picked up a quarrel and that he contacted uncle Srirangan and others compromised the matter and sent her sister to her husband and thereafter, she was in good state and on 28.02.2013 his sister (Rajeswari) was informed about the death of his elder father's son on 27.12.2013 and through phone call at 7.00 a.m. on 01.03.2013 he was informed the death of his sister and her daughter and that he went and saw his sister and that he does not know as to how she had died and that investigated by the railway police.

Further, he had not mentioned in the police enquiry that his uncle Srirangan had a compromise talk and it is correct to state that after the compromise talk, the Appellant / A.1 and his sister Rajeswari were in good terms.

38. P.W.6 in his evidence had deposed that one year before at about 7.00 a.m. in the morning there was a talk that Rajeswari had died at the railway track and in fact P.W.6 was treated as ' Hostile Witness'.

43. P.W.10 in her evidence went on to add that she examined Dr.Ezhil Sundar (who conducted post mortem on the dead bodies) and obtained a post mortem certificate and since the said Doctor went to Delhi in connection with his office work and was not aware as to when he would return, Ex.P.10 and Ex.P.11 (two post mortem reports) were marked through the Investigation officer and after completion of investigation, since A.2 was absconding, she mentioned the same and laid a final report against the Appellant/A.1 and A.2 under Section 306 of Indian Penal Code.

Analysis

45. The 2nd charge levelled against the Appellant / A.1 was that because of his Act, heart broken, his wife Rajeswari because of her imbalanced mental treatment of mind was instigated to commit suicide along with her daughter, Madhubala by falling in front of the train (which came from Salem to Erode) on 01.03.2013 at about 9.30 a.m. in between railway stations Madudanchavadi and Veerapandi KM 349/28 - 350/02 and because of the said fact, was liable to be punished under Section 306 of IPC.

46. Inasmuch as the Appellant's Mother, A.2 (Mother-in-Law of deceased Rajeswari) was acquitted by the trial court in respect of an offence under Sections 498A and 306 of IPC, and also because of the fact that the present Appeal is related to only Appellant / A.1, this Court is not referring to the charges levelled against A.2 (Appellant's Mother under Sections 498A and 306 of IPC in detail)

47. From evidence of P.W.4 and P.W.5 it transpires that the Appellant / A.1 had mortgaged the jewel of his wife Rajeswari and the same was not redeemed by him and when he was enquired about the same, at that point of time, he created a problem and because of the eruption of frequent problem, his wife, Rajeswari came to her parent's house and that apart, the Appellant / A.1 had kept one Kerala Girl in his house and in regard to this also there arose a problem which was informed to her father (P.W.4) and her Brother (P.W.2) and again she was compromised and later when the Appellant / A.1 and his wife, Rajeswari were running the family, the Appellant / A.1 had not permitted his wife Rajeswari to go to the house of her elder father for attending her elder father son's death ceremony and heart broken, along with her daughter Madhubala committed suicide at the railway track and in this regard the evidences of P.W.4 and P.W.5 are quite natural, cogent, coherent and quite convincing one, in the considered opinion of this Court.

48. Besides the above, since the Appellant / A.1 had already brought one kerala girl to his house and was keeping her at his house and also since he had refused to redeem the jewel, which was mortgaged by him and because of these acts of Appellant / A.1, Rajeswari was driven to the extent of committing suicide. It is true that there was a demand of money and articles to be produced by Rajeswari and in this regard, there was no evidence of cruelty being committed, by the Appellant / A.1 under Section 498A of IPC. Therefore, the trial court had rightly found the Appellant / A.1 not guilty in respect of an offence under Section 498A of Indian Penal Code.

52. The trial court in respect of an offence under Section 306 of IPC had awarded punishment of Three Years Rigrous Imprisonment and directed to pay a sum of Rs.1,10,000/- as being fine amount, in default of payment of fine, it also directed him to undergo One Year Simple Imprisonment. Further, from and out of the fine of Rs.1,10,000/- after remittance of the said amount, the sum of Rs.1,00,000/- was ordered to be given to the deceased Rajeswari and to the Appellant / A.1's son Arunkumar (maintained by P.W.4- Grand Father) and the said amount was directed to be deposited in any one of the nationalised bank in the name of said Arunkumar.

55. Be that as it may, in the light of the aforesaid qualitative and quantitative discussions and also this Court taking note of the facts and circumstances of the case in a cumulative fashion, reduces the punishment of Three Years Rigorous Imprisonment to that of Two Years Rigorous Imprisonment. The period already undergone by the Appellant / A.1 is directed to set of under Section 428 of Cr.P.C.

58. With the aforesaid observations, the Criminal Appeal is allowed in part. The Learned Mahila Judge (Fast Track Court), Erode is directed to secure the presence of Appellant / A.1 to immure him in prison to serve the remaining period of sentence.

Keshav Gond And 2 Others vs State Of U.P. And Another on 7 January, 2025
1. Heard Mr. Akhilesh Singh, learned counsel for the applicants, Mr. Amit Singh Chauhan, learned A.G.A. for the State and perused the record.

2. The present 482 Cr.P.C. application has been filed praying for quashing of charge sheet dated 27.12.2022 and cognizance/ summoning order dated 12.01.2023 passed by learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Court No.17, Deoria as well as the impugned order dated 27.05.2024 passed by learned Additional District and Sessions Judge, F.T.C.-First, Deoria in S.T. No. 231 of 2023, Case No. 436 of 2023 (State Vs. Keshav Gond & others), arising out of Case Crime No. 0265 of 2022, under Sections 304-B and 498A I.P.C. and 3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act, Police Station Salempur, District Deoria, pending in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Court No.17, Deoria.

3. Brief facts of the case are that an F.I.R. has been lodged on 13.11.2022 at 20:21 hours under Sections 304B, 498A I.P.C. and 3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 by Smt. Sangita Devi against four persons including the applicants with the allegations that daughter of the informant was married to applicant no.1 on 22.04.2018 according to Hindu Rites and Rituals. On 13.11.2020 at about 8 A.M. in the morning her daughter was done to death by the accused persons for demand of additional dowry. After investigation charge-sheet has been submitted only against the applicants, who are husband, brother-in-law and mother-in-law of the deceased.

4. Learned counsel for the applicants submits that in the F.I.R. no specific allegations have been made against the applicants for causing any cruelty, which has been resulted in the death of the deceased. He further submits that family members of opposite party no.2 were present at the time of preparation of inquest report and postmortem report and they did not raised any such allegations regarding deceased being done to death by the applicants. As per the postmortem report the cause of death is Asphyxia due to ante mortem hanging there being no other injuries on any part of the body of the deceased. The aforesaid goes to show that it is a case of suicide and the applicants are not responsible in any way for the death of the deceased.

5. On the other hand, learned A.G.A. for the State submits that charges against the applicants have already been framed. He further submits that from the inquest report it is clear that information regarding death of the deceased has not been given by any of the applicants, therefore, presumption is against the applicants. He also submits that even the body of the deceased was found in the house of the applicants, therefore, their involvement in the present case cannot be doubted. He further submits that once the charges have already been framed, this Court cannot examine the veracity of the said order while exercising the inherent powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

6. A three Judges Bench of Apex Court in Bhawna Bai Vs. Ghanshyam and others, reported in 2020 (2) SCC 217, wherein Court has held as follows in paragraphs:

?15. Considering the scope of Sections 227 and 228 Crl.P.C., in Amit Kapoor v. Ramesh Chander and another (2012) 9 SCC 460, the Supreme Court held as under:-
""17. Framing of a charge is an exercise of jurisdiction by the trial court in terms of Section 228 of the Code, unless the accused is discharged under Section 227 of the Code. Under both these provisions, the court is required to consider the ""record of the case"" and documents submitted therewith and, after hearing the parties, may either discharge the accused or where it appears to the court and in its opinion there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence, it shall frame the charge. Once the facts and ingredients of the section exists, then the court would be right in presuming that there is ground to proceed against the accused and frame the charge accordingly. This presumption is not a presumption of law as such. The satisfaction of the court in relation to the existence of constituents of an offence and the facts leading to that offence is a sine qua non for exercise of such jurisdiction. It may even be weaker than a prima facie case. There is a fine distinction between the language of Sections 227 and 228 of the Code. Section 227 is the expression of a definite opinion and judgment of the Court while Section 228 is tentative. Thus, to say that at the stage of framing of charge, the Court should form an opinion that the accused is certainly guilty of committing an offence, is an approach which is impermissible in terms of Section 228 of the Code. ........?
19. At the initial stage of framing of a charge, the court is concerned not with proof but with a strong suspicion that the accused has committed an offence, which, if put to trial, could prove him guilty. All that the court has to see is that the material on record and the facts would be compatible with the innocence of the accused or not. The final test of guilt is not to be applied at that stage. We may refer to the well-settled law laid down by this Court in State of Bihar v. Ramesh Singh (1977) 4 SCC 39: (SCC pp. 41-42, para 4) ""4. Under Section 226 of the Code while opening the case for the prosecution the Prosecutor has got to describe the charge against the accused and state by what evidence he proposes to prove the guilt of the accused. Thereafter comes at the initial stage the duty of the court to consider the record of the case and the documents submitted therewith and to hear the submissions of the accused and the prosecution in that behalf. The Judge has to pass thereafter an order either under Section 227 or Section 228 of the Code. If ''the Judge considers that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused, he shall discharge the accused and record his reasons for so doing', as enjoined by Section 227. If, on the other hand, ''the Judge is of opinion that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence which -- ... (b) is exclusively triable by the court, he shall frame in writing a charge against the accused', as provided in Section 228. Reading the two provisions together in juxtaposition, as they have got to be, it would be clear that at the beginning and the initial stage of the trial the truth, veracity and effect of the evidence which the Prosecutor proposes to adduce are not to be meticulously judged. Nor is any weight to be attached to the probable defence of the accused. It is not obligatory for the Judge at that stage of the trial to consider in any detail and weigh in a sensitive balance whether the facts, if proved, would be incompatible with the innocence of the accused or not. The standard of test and judgment which is to be finally applied before recording a finding regarding the guilt or otherwise of the accused is not exactly to be applied at the stage of deciding the matter under Section 227 or Section 228 of the Code. At that stage the court is not to see whether there is sufficient ground for conviction of the accused or whether the trial is sure to end in his conviction.
Strong suspicion against the accused, if the matter remains in the region of suspicion, cannot take the place of proof of his guilt at the conclusion of the trial. But at the initial stage if there is a strong suspicion which leads the court to think that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence then it is not open to the court to say that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. The presumption of the guilt of the accused which is to be drawn at the initial stage is not in the sense of the law governing the trial of criminal cases in France where the accused is presumed to be guilty unless the contrary is proved. But it is only for the purpose of deciding prima facie whether the court should proceed with the trial or not. If the evidence which the Prosecutor proposes to adduce to prove the guilt of the accused even if fully accepted before it is challenged in cross-examination or rebutted by the defence evidence, if any, cannot show that the accused committed the offence, then there will be no sufficient ground for proceeding with the trial. An exhaustive list of the circumstances to indicate as to what will lead to one conclusion or the other is neither possible nor advisable. We may just illustrate the difference of the law by one more example. If the scales of pan as to the guilt or innocence of the accused are something like even at the conclusion of the trial, then, on the theory of benefit of doubt the case is to end in his acquittal. But if, on the other hand, it is so at the initial stage of making an order under Section 227 or Section 228, then in such a situation ordinarily and generally the order which will have to be made will be one under Section 228 and not under Section 227.""
16. After referring to Amit Kapoor, in Dinesh Tiwari v. State of Uttar Pradesh and another (2014) 13 SCC 137, the Supreme Court held that for framing charge under Section 228 Crl.P.C., the judge is not required to record detailed reasons as to why such charge is framed. On perusal of record and hearing of parties, if the judge is of the opinion that there is sufficient ground for presuming that the accused has committed the offence triable by the Court of Session, he shall frame the charge against the accused for such offence.?

7. The aforesaid view has also been held in case of Ravindra Pratap Shahi @ Pappu Shahi vs. State of U.P. and Another, reported in 2021 SCC Online ALL 778.

8. Learned counsel for the applicant could not dispute the aforesaid proposition of law.

9. In view of the aforesaid discussion, this Court does not find any error in the order impugned, accordingly the application u/s 482 is dismissed.

8. The Court below is directed to proceed in accordance with law.

                                                    JUDGMENT
This Criminal Appeal has been preferred as against the judgment and conviction dated 23.11.2016, passed in Sessions Case No.25 of 2003 by the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Kanyakumari at Nagercoil, wherein, the Trial Court has convicted the accused for the offences under Sections 498A and 304B I.P.C read with Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. In the Trial Court, the appellant was arrayed as the first accused and the brother of the first accused viz., Kanagaraj was arrayed as the second accused. During pendency of the case, the second accused died and charges abated against him.


2. The prosecution case is that the first accused got married to deceased Viji@Raj Kokila. The second accused is the brother of first accused. The marriage between the first accused and the deceased Viji@Raj Kokila was solemnized on 04.09.1997. At the time of marriage, a sum of Rs. 1,50,000/- and 25 sovereigns of gold jewels were presented as dowry and also 20 cents of land was given to the first accused. After the birth of two children, the first accused demanded Rs.1 lakh and 15 sovereigns of gold https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis jewels from the deceased Viji@Raj Kokila through her parents. The said demand of dowry was informed to the parents of the deceased. When the same was questioned by the parents of the deceased, the first accused told them that if their daughter has to live happily, they have to pay the demanded dowry. Due to continuous harassment made by the first accused, the deceased committed suicide on 12.05.2001 at about 9.30 p.m by self immolation. Thereafter, the deceased was taken to various hospital whereas lastly, she was admitted in Trivandram Medical College & Hospital, but, on 13.05.2001 at about 8.45 a.m, she died in the hospital. Thereafter, the father of the deceased/P.W.1 has given a complaint before the police and the P.W.16 has registered a First Information Report/Ex.P10 in Crime No.460 of 2001 and thereafter, P.W.17 has investigated the case and P.W.18 further investigated the case and filed a Final Report as against the accused for the offences under Sections 498A and 304B I.P.C read with Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.


3. After filing of the Final Report, the copies of records relied on by the prosecution were furnished to the accused under Section 207 Cr.P.C. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Thereafter, the case was committed to the Sessions Court, Kanyakumari at Nagercoil and the Sessions Case No.25 of 2003 was assigned and then, the case was made over to the Fast Track Mahila Court, Kanyakumari at Nagercoil.


4. The Trial Court, after hearing both sides, framed charges as against the accused for the offences under Sections 498A and 304B I.P.C and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.


5. After framing charges, the charges were read over and explained to the accused. However, the accused denied the charges.

6. The prosecution examined P.W.1 to P.W.18 and marked Exs.P1 to P15 and no material objects were marked. On the side of the defence, D.W.1 was examined and Exs.D1 to D3 were marked.


7. After completion of examination of prosecution witnesses, the Trial Court examined the accused under Section 313(1)(b) Cr.P.C with https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis regard to the incriminating evidence as against him and he denied the same.

8. Thereafter, after analysing the oral and documentary evidence adduced on both sides, the Trial Court found the accused guilty and passed the judgment of conviction and sentence as under:

Provisions under Sentence which convicted S.498-A IPC Three years simple imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.6,000/-, in default, to undergo two months simple imprisonment S.304-B IPC Seven years rigorous imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.15,000/-, in default, to undergo one year rigorous imprisonment S.4 of the Dowry Two years simple imprisonment Prohibition Act and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/-, in default, one months simple imprisonment All the sentences were ordered to run concurrently.
9. Aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment of conviction and sentence passed by the Trial Court, the first accused has preferred this appeal on the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis following grounds:

1. The judgment of Trial Court is not maintainable either in law or on facts and the same is liable to be set aside.
2. The Trial Court failed to consider that the evidence of P.W.1 to P.W.4 were contradictory to one another in the material aspect of demand of dowry by the appellant.
3. The Trial Court failed to consider the delay in more than 20 hours in preferring complaint and registering F.I.R.
4. The Trial Court failed to consider the evidence of P.W.10/the Doctor who attended the deceased at the time of admission in the hospital and who stated that she herself set fire. Further, the Investigation Officer failed to enquire the outpost of the hospital and doctor about the statement given by the deceased.
5. The Trial Court failed to take note that the appellant had purchased a land in the name of the deceased and presented a gold ring to his father-in-law and there is no dispute between them and there is no evidence for demanding dowry.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

6. The Trial Court failed to consider the defence plea that the case was foisted by P.W.1 in connivance with the police personnel Mr.Sathyadoss, who is a relative of P.W.1 and P.W.1 wanted the appellant to settle certain properties in the name of children of the appellant and the deceased, with P.W.1 as a guardian. But, since the appellant refused to do so, the complaint was foisted against him.

7. The Trial Court failed to consider the evidence of D.W.1 to acquit the accused. None of the prosecution witnesses has not spoken about the demand of dowry and they have only spoken about the addiction to alcohol.

8. The Trial Court failed to consider that the prosecution has failed to prove the offence beyond reasonable doubt.


10. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant would contend that the prosecution has failed to prove the charges levelled against the accused beyond reasonable doubt and the evidence of the prosecution witnesses are filled with doubts. The evidence of P.W.1 and P.W.2 are contradictory to each other with regard to the demand of dowry. There is no https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis alleged demand of dowry by the appellant. There is no evidence to prove that soon before the death, there was a demand of dowry due to which, the deceased committed suicide. The evidence of prosecution witnesses with regard to the allegations for the demand of dowry are vague and not specific. The doctor deposed that at the time of admission, the victim also told him that she herself set fire on her. Further, the Trial Court failed to consider that there was a dispute between the prosecution witness and the accused with regard to the transfer of land in favour of the children of the deceased. The deceased and the accused lived happily and the accused also purchased a property in the name of his wife/deceased and the prosecution witnesses have not denied the same and D.W.1, who is sister of the accused also deposed about the land purchased in the name of the deceased and there is no evidence to prove that the accused has caused cruelty and demanded dowry, due to which, she died. Without sufficient evidence, the Trial Court has convicted the accused for the offences under Sections 498A and 304B I.P.C and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. The accused is entitled for acquittal by giving benefit of doubt. Therefore, the Trial Court's judgment of conviction and sentence is liable to be set aside by allowing this appeal. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

11. The learned Government Advocate (Crl.Side) appearing for the respondent would contend that the accused has demanded dowry from the deceased and her parents and further, the accused tortured and caused cruelty to the deceased due to which, she committed suicide by pouring kerosene and setting fire on her. P.W.1 to P.W.4 are parents, brother and sister of the deceased, respectively. They categorically deposed about the demand of dowry by the accused and the other witnesses had not deposed about the demand of dowry made by the accused. The case was investigated by the Investigation Officers/P.W.17 and P.W.18 who deposed about the investigation. There is a presumption under Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act in favour of the prosecution. The prosecution examined P.W.1 to P.W.18 and marked Exs.P1 to P15 and thereby, the prosecution has proved the case as against the accused beyond reasonable doubt and the Trial Court also, after considering all the aspects, convicted and sentenced the accused and hence, this appeal is liable to be dismissed.


12. This Court heard both sides and perused the records. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

13. Upon hearing both sides and perusing the records, judgement of the Trial Court and grounds of appeal, the points for determination in this appeal are as follows:

(a) whether the prosecution has proved the charges levelled against the accused for the offences under Sections 498A and 304B I.P.C and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.
(b)whether the judgment of conviction passed by the Trial Court in Sessions Case No.25 of 2003 is sustainable in law and on facts.
14. The prosecution case is that the deceased is the wife of the accused and their marriage was solemnized on 04.09.1997, after gave a birth of second child, the accused demanded dowry from the parents of the deceased and harassed the deceased. Due to the harassment, the deceased died on 13.05.2001 by committing suicide. Therefore, the accused was charged for the offences under Sections 498A and 304B I.P.C and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

15. In this case, P.W.1 is the de facto complainant and the father of the victim and he deposed before the Trial Court that the accused is his son- in-law and the marriage between his daughter and son-in-law was solemnized on 04.09.1997. At that time, he presented a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- in cash, 25 sovereigns gold ornaments and settled 20 cents of land to the first accused. Thereafter, two children were born to them. After the birth of the second child, the accused consumed alcohol and demanded 15 sovereigns of gold jewels and cash of Rs.1,00,000/- and the same was denied by the parents of the deceased. Very often, the accused demanded dowry and sometimes, the sister of the deceased also came to the house of the deceased. On the morning of 08.05.2001, when the sister of the deceased went to the house of the accused, he assaulted the deceased. After two or three days, the sister of the deceased left from her sister’s house and went to her house. Immediately, on the morning of 13.05.2001, he received a phone call about his daughter's death. Immediately, he went to Trivandram Medical College & Hospital, where his daughter was unconscious. At that time, both the accused were present. When he asked about the incident to the accused, he told that the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis deceased only did the same. When P.W.1 asked her daughter, she showed her fingers as against both the accused and told in slow voice that the accused poured kerosene and set fire on the deceased. Thereafter, he returned to house and then, as requested by the villagers, he gave a complaint before the police. The complaint was marked as Ex.P1. A perusal of Ex.P1, reveals that on 08.05.2001, the de facto-complainant’s younger daughter went to the house of accused. At that time, the accused assaulted the deceased by demanding 15 sovereigns of gold ornaments and Rs.1,00,000/-. Thereafter, on 12.05.2001, the younger daughter of P.W.1 left from the house of the deceased and came to her house. Thereafter, on 13.05.2001 at about 1.30 p.m, he received a phone call that his daughter died. Immediately, he rushed to Trivandram Medical College & Hospital and saw his daughter with burn injuries and was under treatment. When he asked her about the incident, she replied through gesture by showing his son-in-law and the second accused who abetted the first accused. Therefore, he suspected the death of his daughter.

16. According to the evidence P.W.1, when he saw the deceased in the hospital, she was unconscious, but in the complaint, he has stated that she https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis was unable to speak, but showed some gesture by pointing her fingers towards her husband. But, in the evidence of P.W.1, he stated that the deceased showed two fingers towards both the accused, but, in the complaint, there is no reference about the showing of two fingers towards both the accused and the complaint was that the deceased showed gesture towards the first accused and there is no reference about the second accused and merely stated that the second accused also abetted the offence. Therefore, there are major contradictions between the evidence of P.W.1 and complaint given by him with regard to the physical condition of deceased and identification of accused by her. Further, as per the evidence of P.W.7, on 12.05.2001 at about 12.30 a.m, P.W.1 came to his house and stated that his daughter was admitted in the hospital and thereafter, he along with P.W.1 to P.W.3 went to hospital. At that time, the deceased was alive and P.W.1 called her, immediately she opened her eyes and moved her two fingers. P.W.7 has not stated anything about the accused and the signs made by the deceased towards the accused. Further, as per the complaint, the accused set fire on the deceased by pouring kerosene, but the prosecution case is that she committed suicide. Therefore, reasonable doubt would arise on the prosecution case and the evidence of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis P.W.1 with regard to the occurrence.


17. P.W.2 is the mother of the deceased and in her evidence, she also stated that the first accused, after the birth of second child, got addicted to alcohol and demanded dowry. Further, the accused intimidated that if they failed to give dowry, he would murder her daughter. In the meantime, on 08.05.2001, her younger daughter went to the house of the deceased. At that time also the first accused assaulted the deceased, and thereafter, on the next day, she committed suicide. Then, she along with her husband, went to Trivandram Medical College & Hospital. At that time, the deceased was unable to speak and she showed two fingers towards the accused.

18. P.W.3 who is the brother of the deceased also stated on the same lines. He also stated that the deceased showed two fingers towards the accused and further, he enquired the neighbours and they told him that the accused demanded dowry but none of the prosecution witnesses has stated about the alleged demand of dowry. Further, the evidence of P.W.1, P.W.2 and P.W.3 is not specific with regard to the date of demand by the accused https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and vaguely, they have stated that the accused demanded dowry of one lakh and jewels.


19. According to P.W.1, the accused demanded a sum of Rs. 1,00,000/- and 15 sovereigns of gold jewels; according to P.W.2, the accused demanded Rs.1,00,000/- and 5 sovereigns of gold jewels; according to the evidence of P.W.3, there is no mention about the quantum of money and P.W.4, sister of deceased, also stated that the accused demanded a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- and 15 sovereigns of gold jewels. She also stated about the assault of her sister that on 12.05.2001 at about 8.30 p.m when she was in her sister’s house, the accused tortured her sister. There is no specific overt act against the accused. Therefore, the evidence P.W.1 to P.W.4 are contradictory to each other with regard to demand of dowry.

20. In this context, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant drew the attention of this Court that the deceased was admitted in the hospital and she, for the first time opened her mouth and told about the occurrence, that was the first statement given by the deceased. The said doctor was https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis examined as P.W.10 and he deposed that on 13.05.2001 at about 1.15 a.m, a 24 years lady, namely Viji was brought for treatment for 95% burn injuries and she died on the same day at about 8.45 a.m and stated that she committed for suicide. Further, P.W.13 who admitted the deceased in the hospital, stated that on 13.05.2001 at about 1.00 a.m, he examined the deceased and he also issued a certificate/Ex.P8. At that time, she told that she self immolated (mtu; jdf;Fj; jhnd kz;bzz;bza; Cw;wp jP itj;Jf; bfhz;ljhft[k;. ,ut[ 9 ½ kzpf;F ,t;thW rk;gtk; ele;jjhf Twpdhu;) Therefore, the evidence P.W.13 reveals that the deceased was conscious at the time of admission and she herself told that she self-immolated. At that time, she did not state anything about the involvement of accused in this case. Therefore, there are no any incriminating materials revealed from the evidence of P.W.13 and further, during the cross-examination, P.W.13 stated that he tried to know how she sustained injuries, but she stated that she herself poured kerosene and set fire on her. Therefore, the evidence of P.W.13 reveals that the deceased stated that she had self-immolated, but the deceased did not say anything about the conduct of the accused in this case. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

21. Had the accused demanded dowry from the deceased and she set fire due to that demand of dowry, the deceased would have stated about the alleged demand of dowry but she has not stated before the doctor that she set fire due to the harassment made by the accused. When the deceased was able to say about the self-immolation, she ought to have stated about the accused, if the accused demanded dowry, but she has not stated anything about the accused. The evidence of P.W.1 to P.W.4 were also not specific about the demand of dowry as to when the accused demanded dowry. A perusal of evidence P.W.1 to P.W.4 shows that all the witnesses vaguely stated that the accused demanded dowry of 15 sovereigns of gold ornaments and Rs. 1,00,000/-. While so, there is no specific date when he demanded dowry. As per the evidence of P.W.1 to P.W.3, after the birth of the second child, the first accused harassed by demanding dowry, but the date of occurrence is 2001. Therefore, there is no evidence to show that soon before the death of the deceased, she was subjected to cruelty by demanding dowry. When the deceased was alive, the first accused also purchased a land in her name and the same is also not denied by P.W.1 to P.W.4 and the accused also, examined her sister as D.W.1.

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

22. D.W.1 who is the sister of the first accused, also deposed about the marriage expenses incurred by the first accused and the property purchased by him in the name of the deceased. Therefore, there is no evidence to show that the accused caused cruelty towards the deceased and the accused demanded dowry and thereby, the deceased died due to the harassment made by the accused.


23. As per the evidences P.W.1 to P.W.4, the deceased was unconscious and was not in a position to speak and she only showed signs. But, if so, how did the prosecution witnesses state that the accused only poured the kerosene towards the deceased and set fire. But, there is no explanation in that regard.


24. It is not a case of the prosecution that the accused committed murder of the deceased. But, the evidence of P.W.1 and P.W.2 show that the accused poured kerosene and set fire, thereby committed murder of the deceased. Therefore, it is clear that P.W.1 to P.W.4 have exaggerated the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis incident and deposed before the Court.


25. Further, the accused only took the deceased to various hospitals for treatment and it shows the conduct of the accused. Further, P.W.1 himself admitted that even after the marriage of the accused with his daughter, they attended the marriage function of the brother of the accused and presented gifts. Therefore, there is no enmity between the parties with regard to dowry prior to the death of the deceased.


26. Further, P.W.4 in her cross-examination, stated that at the instigation of the family members, later on, she gave a statement before the Trial Court and the Police and further, all the prosecution witnesses admitted that the accused only took care of his children.


27. P.W.6 who is the neighbour of the deceased also, in his evidence, stated that on the date of occurrence at 9.30 p.m, when he was lying after his dinner, he heard the cry of the deceased. Immediately, he rushed there and saw the deceased with burn injuries. Immediately, he, along with the accused, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis took her to the hospital and at that time, two children of the deceased were also there. When P.W.6 went along with the deceased to the hospital, if any dowry had been demanded by the first accused, the deceased would have certainly stated about the demand of dowry to P.W.6, but, no words were spoken by the deceased with regard to the demand of dowry. Therefore, the available evidence adduced by the prosecution are not sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused for the offences under Sections 498A and 304B I.P.C and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. But, the Trial Court without consideration of the abovesaid aspects, wrongly convicted the accused. The Trial Court ought to have given benefit of doubt to the accused, but, without consideration of the abovesaid aspects, wrongly convicted the accused.

28. Therefore, as discussed above, this Court is of the opinion that the prosecution has failed to prove the charges levelled against the accused for the offences under Sections 498A and 304B I.P.C and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, beyond reasonable doubt.

29. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant relied on the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Charan Singh Vs. State of Uttarakhand, (Crl.A.No.447 of 2012, decided on 20.04.2023) wherein, it was held as under:

“13.A conjoint reading of Section 304B I.P.C and Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act with reference to the presumption raised was discussed in para 32 of the aforesaid judgment, which is extracted below:
“32.This Court while often dwelling on the scope and purport of Section 304-B of the Code and Section 113-B of the Act have propounded that the presumption is contingent on the fact that the prosecution first spell out the ingredients of the offence of Section 304-B as in Shindo v.State of Punjab [Shindo v.State of Punjab, (2011) 11 SCC 517 : (2011) 3 SCC (Cri) 394] and echoed in Rajeev Kumar v. State of Haryana [Rajeev Kumar v.State of Haryana, (2013) 16 SCC 640 : (2014) 6 SCC (Cri) 346].
In the latter pronouncement, this Court propounded that one o the essential ingredients of dowry death under Section 304-B of the Cod is that the accused must have subjected the woman to cruelty in connection with demand for dowry soon before her death and that this ingredient has to be proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt and only then the Court will presume that the accused has committed the offence of dowry death under Section 113-B of the Act. It referred to with approval, the earlier decision of this Court in K. Prema S.Rao v. Yadla Srinivasa Rao [K. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Prema S.Rao v.Yadla Srinivasa Rao, (2003) 1 SCC 217 : 2003 SCC (Cri) 271] to the effect that to attract the provision of Section 304-B of the Code, one of the main ingredients of the offence which is required to be established is that “soon before her death” she was Criminal Appeal No.447 of 2012 subjected to cruelty and harassment “in connection with the demand for dowry”.”

30. Further, he relied on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Rajeev Kumar Vs State of Haryana, (Crl.A.No.967 of 2005, decided on 31.10.2013) wherein, it was held as under:

“On the evidence on record, though the appellant is not guilty of the offence under Section 304B of IPC, he is certainly guilty of offences of abetment of suicide and cruelty. Section 113-A of the Indian Evidence Act states as follows:
113A. Presumption as to abetment of suicide by a married woman. - When the question is whether the commission of suicide by a woman had been abetted by her husband or any relative of her husband and it is shown that she had committed suicide within a period of seven years from the date of her marriage and that her husband or such relative of her husband had subjected her to cruelty, the court may presume, having regard to all the other circumstances of the case, that such suicide had been abetted by her husband or by such relative of her husband.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Explanation.-- For the purposes of this section, “cruelty” shall have the same meaning as in section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. The language of Section 113-A of the Indian Evidence Act makes it clear that if a woman has committed suicide within a period of seven years from the date of her marriage and that her husband had subjected her to cruelty, the court may presume, having regard to all the other circumstances of the case, that such suicide had been abetted by her husband. The Explanation to Section 113-A of the Indian Evidence Act states that for the purpose of Section 113-A cruelty shall have the same meaning as in Section 498A, IPC. The Explanation to Section 498A,IPC, defines cruelty and Clause (a) of the Explanation states that cruelty means any willful conduct which is of such nature as likely to drive a woman to commit suicide. The dying declaration of the deceased (Ext.PN) as well as the evidence of P.W-5 extracted above are sufficient to establish that the appellant used to fight on petty issues and give beating to the deceased, which drove the deceased to commit suicide. This is, therefore, a clear case where the appellant had committed offences under Sections 498A and 306, IPC.”
31. On a careful reading of the abovesaid judgments, it is clear that to attract the offence under Section 304B I.P.C, an essential ingredient is that the accused himself have subjected the woman to cruelty in connection with the demand for dowry soon before her death and the same has to be proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt and only then, the Court will https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis presume that the accused has committed the offence of dowry death under Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act. In the case on hand, the evidence of the prosecution witnesses are filled with doubts and the prosecution failed to prove the demand of dowry by the accused soon before the death of the deceased. Therefore, the abovesaid case laws will be squarely applicable to the present case.


32. In view of the abovesaid discussion, this Court is of the opinion that the prosecution has failed to prove the charges levelled against the accused for the offences under Sections 498A and 304B I.P.C and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, beyond reasonable doubt. Thereby, the judgment of conviction and sentence passed by the Trial Court are unsustainable and are liable to be set aside.


33. In the result, this appeal is allowed and judgment of conviction and sentence passed by the Trial Court in S.C.No.25 of 2003 on the file of the Sessions Court, Fast Track Mahila Court, Kanyakumari at Nagercoil are set aside and the appellant is acquitted of the charges under Sections 498A and 304B I.P.C and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act and he be set at https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis liberty, if he is not required in connection with any other cases. Bail bond, if any, executed shall stand cancelled. The fine amount, if any, paid by the appellant shall be refunded.

Smt Amtul And Another vs State Of U.P.,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/196970389/,"Allahabad High Court
Smt Amtul And Another vs State Of U.P. on 7 January, 2025
1. Heard Mr. Amit Kumar Srivastava, learned counsel for the applicants, Mr. Sikandar Khan, learned counsel for the informant, Mr. Amit Singh Chauhan, learned AGA-I for the State and perused the material on record.

2. The instant bail application has been filed on behalf of the applicants, Smt. Amtul and Harun with a prayer to release them on bail in Case Crime No.447 of 2023, under sections 498A, 323, 302, 326, 120B IPC and Section 3/4 of Dowry Prohibition Act, Police Station ? Masoori, District ?Ghaziabad, during pendency of trial.

3. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicants are innocent and have been falsely implicated in the present case due to ulterior motive. He further submits that the applicants are sister-in-law (Jethani) and borther-in-law (Jeth) of the deceased. The other co-accused; Smt. Reshma and Tahir have already been granted bail by this Court vide order dated 10.05.2024 and 22.05.2024 passed in Cri. Misc. Bail Application No.18233 of 2024 and 18889 of 2024 respectively, copy of which orders have been passed on to the Court today, are kept on record and the case of the applicants stand similar footings. Hence the applicants are also entitled for bail on the ground of parity. He further submits that the applicants have no criminal history except the present case and is languishing in jail since 12.01.2024. In case, he is released on bail, they will not misuse the liberty of bail and will cooperate in the trial by all means. Lastly, it is submitted that there is no chance of applicants fleeing away from judicial process or tampering with the witnesses.

4. Per contra learned A.G.A. as well as learned counsel for the informant has opposed the bail prayer of the applicant by contending that the innocence of the applicants cannot be adjudged at pre trial stage, therefore, he does not deserves any indulgence. In case the applicants are released on bail he will again indulge in similar activities and will misuse the liberty of bail. However, they could not dispute the fact that the co-accused person has already been released on bail.

5. The well-known principle of ""Presumption of Innocence Unless Proven Guilty,"" gives rise to the concept of bail as a rule and imprisonment as an exception. A person's right to life and liberty, guaranteed by Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, cannot be taken away simply because he or she is accused of committing an offence until the guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt. Article 21 of the Indian Constitution states that no one's life or personal liberty may be taken away unless the procedure established by law is followed, and the procedure must be just and reasonable. The said principle has been reiterated by the Apex Court in Satyendra Kumar Antil Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and another, 2022 (10) SCC 51. Learned AGA has not shown any exceptional circumstances which would warrant denial of bail to the applicant.

6. It is settled principle of law that the object of bail is to secure the attendance of the accused at the trial. No material particulars or circumstances suggestive of the applicant fleeing from justice or thwarting the course of justice or creating other troubles in the shape of repeating offences or intimidating witnesses and the like have been shown by learned AGA for the State.

7. The object of the bail is to secure the attendance of the accused, the detention of the accused pending trial cannot be punitive in nature as there is presumption of innocence in favour of the accused person. Learned A.G.A. has not brought any facts and circumstances to demonstrate that the character of the accused-applicant(s) is such that his mere presence at large would intimidate the witness. Learned AGA for the State has not brought any fact or circumstances to indicate criminal history or antecedents of the applicant which would disentitle the applicant for Bail.

8. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, nature of offence, evidence, complicity of the accused, the period of detention of the applicant for the alleged offence, submissions of learned counsel for the parties, the Court is of the view that the applicant has made out a case for bail. The bail application is allowed.

9. Let the applicants involved in the aforesaid case crime be released on bail on their furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each of the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned, subject to the following conditions:-

(i) The applicants will not tamper with the evidence during the trial.
(ii) The applicants will not pressurize/intimidate the prosecution witness.
(iii) The applicants shall remain present before the trial court on each date fixed, either personally or through his counsel.
(iv) The applicants shall not commit an offence similar to the offence of which he is accused, or suspected, of the commission of which he is suspected.
(v) The applicants shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any police officer or tamper with the evidence.
(vi) The applicants shall not leave India without the previous permission of the Court.
(vii) In the event, the applicants changes residential address, the applicant shall inform the court concerned about new residential address in writing.
(viii) In case, the applicants misuses the liberty of bail during trial and in order to secure his presence proclamation under Section 82 Cr.P.C. is issued and the applicants fail to appear before the court on the date fixed in such proclamation, then, the trial court shall initiate proceedings against him, in accordance with law, under Section 174-A of the Indian Penal Code.
10. In case of breach of any of the above condition, the prosecution shall be at liberty to move bail cancellation application before this Court.

11. It is clarified that the observations, if any, made in this order are strictly confined to the disposal of the bail application and must not be construed to have any reflection on the ultimate merits of the case.

The petitioners have filed the present petition, under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as 'the Cr. P.C..) for quashing 2 2025:HHC:2249 of FIR No. 298/2020, dated 8.8.2020, (hereinafter referred to as 'the FIR in question'), registered under Sections 498A, 323, 355, 504, 506 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (hereinafter referred to as 'the IPC'),with Police Station, Sunder Nagar, District Mandi, H.P., as well as, the proceedings resultant thereto, stated to be pending before the Court of learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sundernagar, District Mandi, H.P. (hereinafter referred to as 'the trial Court').

2. The present petition has been filed on the ground that at the instance of respondent No. 2, Shalini Chauhan, the FIR in question has been registered, in which, the Police has conducted investigation and filed the charge-sheet.

3. After investigation, Police has registered a case under Section 498-A, 323, 355, 504, 506 and 34 IPC and Section of the Dowry Prohibition Act, with Police Station Sunder Nagar, District Mandi, H.P. against Labh Singh, Meera Devi, Randeep Singh, Deepali, Gaurav Bhardwaj and Joginder Singh, whereas, case 3 2025:HHC:2249 under Sections 323, 504 and 506 IPC was registered against one Joginder Singh.

4. The FIR in question was registered at the instance of respondent No. 2, Shalini Chauhan, who has alleged that she was married to accused Randeep Singh, S/o Labh Singh, on 19.4.2019. She has alleged that after sometime of marriage, she has allegedly been tortured for bringing less dowry in the hands of the accused persons. She has further alleged that accused persons had allegedly told her that they had borrowed a sum of Rs. 65,00,000/- and pressurized her to bring that amount from her parents. As per respondent No. 2, accused persons used to abuse her, as well as, her parents. They also used to force her to go to some Baba. They used to ask her to wake up at 5:00 a.m. to perform the puja of said Baba.

5. She has further alleged that her sister-in-law, Deepali and her husband Gaurav (petitioners) used to threaten her. Deepali is alleged to be living in her parents' house and used to quarrel with her. It is further alleged that in-laws of respondent No. 2 used 4 2025:HHC:2249 to threaten her that her brother-in-law is a lawyer and he will, within no time, manage to get divorce and no one can raise finger upon them, as they are having links with the Judges. She has further alleged that on the eve of Diwali, she was at home and nobody talked to her. On the occasion of Bhaiya Dooj, when, she tried to go to her parents, her father-in-law directed her to bring a sum of Rs. 65,00,000/-, otherwise, there is no need to come back. When, she returned back, they asked her to get out of the house. When, she refused to go from matrimonial home, then, they tried to throw her out of the house. She was allegedly beaten by her husband, Randeep Singh. Her father-in- law abused her and started humiliating her. 5.1 Next day, when, parents of the complainant visited the matrimonial home of the complainant to talk to her in-laws, her in-laws started quarreling with them and also beaten them. However, parents of the complainant insisted the complainant to be in her matrimonial home. She has further alleged that when she had joined her duties in the Bank, then, she 5 2025:HHC:2249 realized that she is not in a position to hear. On visiting the Doctor, she came to know that there is clotting in her ear.

5.2 When, on 13.6.2020, she returned to her matrimonial home, she had not been permitted to enter the house and her husband directed her to live in the ground floor. She was directed to complete domestic chores before 7 a.m. and thereafter, not to show her face to them. She was directed to prepare dinner after 8 p.m. According to the complainant, they also used to switch off the gas. She has further alleged that on 22.7.2020, her in-laws called her characterless and also abused her parents. They had allegedly demanded a sum of Rs. 65,00,000/- from her parents. She has further alleged that she was not permitted to watch TV after 11:00 p.m. She has further alleged that the accused persons used to knock at her door at 3:00 a.m. and 4:00 am and used to raise the volume of TV, just to harass and mentally torture her. 5.3 It has further been alleged by the complainant that the petitioners used to threaten her to get divorce.

6 2025:HHC:2249 They also used to pass bad comments against her. According to the complainant, petitioner Deepali also tried to throw her out of her matrimonial home, by saying that the house belongs to her. On 8.8.2020, father of the complainant alongwith her uncle, allegedly visited her matrimonial home to talk to her in-laws. However, when the discussion was going on, after sometime, her husband allegedly got furious. When, father of the complainant asked the accused persons about her fault, they directed him to take her from the matrimonial home and started abusing her. She has further alleged that her father-in-law had injured her father by hitting him with a brick.

7 2025:HHC:2249

7. Indulgence of this Court has been sought to quash the FIR against the petitioners, on the ground that they have nothing to do with the alleged crime, in which, they have been named, as accused. According to the petitioners, bare perusal of the Challan does not make out a case, against the petitioners and they have simply been involved in the present case, being her sister-in-law and brother-in-law.

8. According to the petitioners, there is no iota of evidence, as to how and to what extent, any torture or harassment was caused by the petitioners to the complainant. Highlighting the fact that even in the MLC of the victim, no injury whatsoever was attributed to the present petitioners, as they were not present on the spot, the allegations are stated to be bald.

9. It is the case of the petitioner that in case, the allegations of the complainant are taken as it is, then also, no offence is made out against the petitioners. The FIR is also stated to be abuse of process of law.

10. According to the petitioners, if the proceedings 8 2025:HHC:2249 are permitted to continue, then, it would be nothing, but abuse of process of law.

9. On the basis of above facts, a prayer has been made to allow the present petition by quashing the FIR in question, as well as, proceedings resultant thereto, which are stated to be pending, before the learned trial Court.

10. When, put to notice, the petition has been contested by the respondent-State by filing reply, in which, they have asserted the manner, in which, the FIR in question was registered and the investigation was conducted. Controverting the stand of the petitioners, it has been submitted by the respondent- State that during investigation, the Police found the involvement of the petitioners, as such, they have rightly been charge-sheeted, in this case.

11. Respondent No. 2 has filed separate reply by taking preliminary objections that even if the allegations, as levelled against the complainant, are taken as it is, then also, no case is made for quashing the FIR in question. She has also reiterated the fact as 9 2025:HHC:2249 to how the petitioners had treated her with cruelty, by highlighting the 'specific allegations', against both the petitioners.

12. By moving Cr.M.P.(M) No. 4129 of 2024, the petitioners have placed on record certain documents, i.e. FIR No. 297 of 2020, statement of the complainant, recorded in Domestic Violence Act, titled as, 'Shalini Chauhan versus Randeep Kumar & others', pending in the Court of learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Court No. 1, Sundernagar, District Mandi, HP, pleadings of the parties, in Civil Suit No. 11- 1/2023, titled as, 'Puran Chand & others versus Labh Singh', pending adjudication before the learned Senior Civil Judge, Court No. 1, Sundernagar, District Mandi, H.P.

13. The petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction of this Court, by way of filing the present petition, under Section 482 of the Cr. P.C., seeking quashing of the FIR registered against them, and the proceedings resultant thereto. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Rajiv Thapar and others versus Madan Lal Kapoor,reported in 10 2025:HHC:2249 2013(3) Supreme Court Cases 330, has issued certain directions for exercising the powers under Section 482 Cr. P.C. Relevant paragraphs 28 to 30 are reproduced as under:

""28. The High Court, in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., must make a just and rightful choice. This is not a stage of evaluating the truthfulness or otherwise of allegations levelled by the prosecution/complainant against the accused. Likewise, it is not a stage for determining how weighty the defences raised on behalf of the accused is. Even if the accused is successful in showing some suspicion or doubt, in the allegations levelled by the prosecution/complainant, it would be impermissible to discharge the accused before trial. This is so, because it would result in giving finality to the accusations levelled by the prosecution/complainant, without allowing the prosecution or the complainant to adduce evidence to substantiate the same. The converse is, however, not true, because even if trial is proceeded with, the accused is not subjected to any irreparable consequences. The accused would still be in a position to succeed, by establishing his defences by producing evidence in accordance with law. There is an endless list of judgments rendered by this Court declaring the legal position, that in a case where the prosecution/complainant has levelled allegations bringing out all ingredients of the charge(s) levelled, and have placed material before the Court, prima facie evidencing the truthfulness of the allegations levelled, trial must be held.
29. The issue being examined in the instant case is the jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., if it chooses to quash the initiation of the prosecution
11 2025:HHC:2249 against an accused, at the stage of issuing process, or at the stage of committal, or even at the stage of framing of charges. These are all stages before the commencement of the actual trial. The same parameters would naturally be available for later stages as well. The power vested in the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., at the stages referred to hereinabove, would have far reaching consequences, inasmuch as, it would negate the prosecution's/complainant's case without allowing the prosecution/complainant to lead evidence. Such a determination must always be rendered with caution, care and circumspection. To invoke its inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. the High Court has to be fully satisfied, that the material produced by the accused is such, that would lead to the conclusion, that his/their defence is based on sound, reasonable, and indubitable facts; the material produced is such, as would rule out and displace the assertions contained in the charges levelled against the accused; and the material produced is such, as would clearly reject and overrule the veracity of the allegations contained in the accusations levelled by the prosecution/complainant. It should be sufficient to rule out, reject and discard the accusations levelled by the prosecution/complainant, without the necessity of recording any evidence. For this the material relied upon by the defence should not have been refuted, or alternatively, cannot be justifiably refuted, being material of sterling and impeccable quality. The material relied upon by the accused should be such, as would persuade a reasonable person to dismiss and condemn the actual basis of the accusations as false. In such a situation, the judicial conscience of the High Court would persuade it to exercise its power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. to quash such criminal proceedings, for that would prevent abuse of process of the court, and secure the ends of justice.

12 2025:HHC:2249

30. Based on the factors canvassed in the foregoing paragraphs, we would delineate the following steps to determine the veracity of a prayer for quashing, raised by an accused by invoking the power vested in the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.:-

30.1 Step one, whether the material relied upon by the accused is sound, reasonable, and indubitable, i.e., the material is of sterling and impeccable quality?
30.2 Step two, whether the material relied upon by the accused, would rule out the assertions contained in the charges levelled against the accused, i.e., the material is sufficient to reject and overrule the factual assertions contained in the complaint, i.e., the material is such, as would persuade a reasonable person to dismiss and condemn the factual basis of the accusations as false.
30.3 Step three, whether the material relied upon by the accused, has not been refuted by the prosecution/complainant; and/or the material is such, that it cannot be justifiably refuted by the prosecution/complainant?
30.4 Step four, whether proceeding with the trial would result in an abuse of process of the court, and would not serve the ends of justice?
30.5 If the answer to all the steps is in the affirmative, judicial conscience of the High Court should persuade it to quash such criminal proceedings, in exercise of power vested in it under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. Such exercise of power, besides doing justice to the accused, would save precious court time, which would otherwise be wasted in holding such a trial (as well as, proceedings arising therefrom) specially 13 2025:HHC:2249 when, it is clear that the same would not conclude in the conviction of the accused.""
14. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Shafiya Khan @ Shakuntala Prajapati versus State of Uttar Pradesh & anr., reported as (2022) 4 Supreme Court Cases 549 has held that if there are bald allegations, but nothing to justify the same, the powers under Section 482 Cr. P.C. should be exercised to quash the proceedings. Relevant paragraphs 14 and 15 are reproduced, as under:
""14. The exposition of law on the subject relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article 226 of the Constitution or the inherent power under Section 482 Cr.PC are well settled and to the possible extent, this Court has defined sufficiently channelized guidelines, to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be exercised. This Court has held in para 102 in State of Haryana and Others v. Bhajan Lal and Others (supra) as under :
""102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of the Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article 226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code which we have extracted and reproduced above, we give the following categories of cases by way of illustration wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and 14 2025:HHC:2249 sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be exercised.
(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a non cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code.
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.
15 2025:HHC:2249 (6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.""
15. The principles laid down by this Court have consistently been followed, as well as in the recent judgment of three Judge judgment of this Court in Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra and Others.""

15. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in a recent decision in Payal Sharma versus State of Punjab & Anr., Citation No. 2024 INSC 896, has held that there is tendency to rope in the entire family in the matrimonial dispute. It has also been held that in case of lack of specific allegations, it is the duty of the Court to consider the contentions, under Section 482 Cr. P.C., whether the allegations, so levelled, against the relatives, make out a prima-facie case, against them, or not. Relevant paragraphs 9 to 12 of the judgment are reproduced, as under:

16 2025:HHC:2249 ""9. In the decision in Preeti Gupta & Anr. v. State of Jharkhand & Anr.1, this Court observed that it is a matter of common knowledge that in matrimonial disputes exaggerated versions of the incident are reflected in a large number of complaints and the tendency of over implication is also reflected in a large number of cases. The criminal trials lead to immense sufferings for all concerned. Even ultimate acquittal in the trial may also not be able to wipe out the deep scars of sufferings of ignominy, it was further held therein. We have no hesitation to hold that the said observation of this Court is in fact, sounding of a caution, against non-discharge of the duty to see whether implication of a person who is not a close relative of the family of the husband is over implication or whether allegation against any such person is an exaggerated version, in matrimonial disputes of this nature. In this context, it is to be noted that the term 'relative' has not been defined in the statute and, therefore, it must be assigned a meaning as is commonly understood. Hence, normally, it can be taken to include, father, mother, husband or wife, son, daughter, brother, sister, nephew, niece, grandson or granddaughter of any individual or the spouse of any person. To put it shortly, it includes a person related by blood, marriage or adoption. In paragraph 35 of Preeti Gupta's case (supra) it was furthermore held thus:-

""The courts have to be extremely careful and cautious in dealing with these complaints and must take pragmatic realties into consideration while dealing with matrimonial cases. The allegations of harassment by husband's close relatives who had been living in different cities and never visited or rarely visited the place where the complainant resided would have an entirely different complexion. The allegations of the 17 2025:HHC:2249 complainant are required to be scrutinized with great care and circumspection.""
10. In such circumstances, normally against a person who is not falling under any of the aforesaid categories when allegations are raised, in the light of the observations made in Preeti Gupta's case (supra), the Court concerned owes an irrecusable duty to see whether such implication is over implication and/or whether the allegations against such a person is an exaggerated version. We have already taken note of the fact that except the observation made in paragraph 7 there is no consideration at all of the contentions of accused No.5 in the impugned order.

11. In the decision in Geeta Mehrotra and Anr. v. State of U.P. and Anr. , this Court held that mere casual reference of the names of the family members in a matrimonial dispute without allegation of active involvement in the matter would not justify taking cognizance against them overlooking the tendency of over implication viz., to draw the entire members of the household in the domestic quarrel resulting in matrimonial dispute, especially when it happens soon after the wedding. In the decision in Kahkashan Kausar @ Sonam and Others v. State of Bihar & Ors., this Court quashed proceedings in so far as family members of the husband on the ground that the allegations against them are general and ominous in nature. In matters like the one at hand when relatives not residing in the same house where the alleged victim resides, the courts shall not stop consideration by merely looking into the question where the accused is a person falling within the ambit of the expression 'relative' for the purpose of Section 498-A, IPC, but should also consider whether it is a case of over implication or exaggerated version solely to implicate such person(s) to pressurise the main accused. It is also relevant to refer to the decision of this Court in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, wherein after 18 2025:HHC:2249 considering the statutory provisions and the earlier decisions, this Court referred to various categories of cases where the inherent powers under Section 482, Cr. P.C. could be exercised by High Court to prevent abuse of process of Court or otherwise to secure ends of justice. One among such categories is where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent man could ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against an accused.

12. We will proceed to consider the case in respect of accused No.5 a little later and now, will consider the challenge of complainant against quashment of the subject FIR and all consequential proceedings based thereon, qua accused No.6 bearing in mind the above conclusions and decisions. It is to be noted that the impugned order itself would reveal that the learned counsel who appeared for the complainant admitted before the High Court regarding the absence of allegations against accused No.6 as relates offences under Sections 406 and 498-A, IPC. This is discernible from paragraph 6 of the impugned order and it reads thus:-

""6. Qua Petitioner No.1, Ld. Counsel admits that so far as Sections 406 and 498-A are concerned, there are no specific allegations. He asserts that offences punishable under Sections 420 and 120- B of the IPC have been added later on and the allegations levelled against petitioner No.1 shall well fall within the ambit of Sections 420 IPC and 417 of the IPC.""
16. In this case, learned counsel for respondent No. 2 has raised objections that arguments of learned senior 19 2025:HHC:2249 counsel appearing for petitioners, qua the fact that entire family members have been roped-in, in the case, on the general allegations, is not liable to be considered, as powers under Section 482 Cr. P.C. are confined only to see whether a prima-facie case is made out against the petitioners or not.

17. The arguments of the learned cunsel for respondent No. 2 are not acceptable in view of a recent decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mahmood Ali & others versus State of H.P. & others, Citation No. 2023 INSC 684, wherein, it has been held that in frivolous or vexatious proceedings, the Court owes a duty to look into many other attending circumstances emerging from the record of the case. Relevant paragraphs 12 and 13 of the judgment are reproduced as under:

""12. At this stage, we would like to observe something important. Whenever an accused comes before the Court invoking either the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) or extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution to get the FIR or the criminal proceedings quashed essentially on the ground that such proceedings are manifestly frivolous or vexatious or instituted with the ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance, then in such circumstances the Court owes a duty to look into the FIR with care and a little more closely.
20 2025:HHC:2249 We say so because once the complainant decides to proceed against the accused with an ulterior motive for wreaking personal vengeance, etc., then he would ensure that the FIR/complaint is very well drafted with all the necessary pleadings. The complainant would ensure that the averments made in the FIR/complaint are such that they disclose the necessary ingredients to constitute the alleged offence. Therefore, it will not be just enough for the Court to look into the averments made in the FIR/complaint alone for the purpose of ascertaining whether the necessary ingredients to constitute the alleged offence are disclosed or not. In frivolous or vexatious proceedings, the Court owes a duty to look into many other attending circumstances emerging from the record of the case over and above the averments and, if need be, with due care and circumspection try to read in between the lines.
The Court while exercising its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the CrPC or Article 226 of the Constitution need not restrict itself only to the stage of a case but is empowered to take into account the overall circumstances leading to the initiation/registration of the case as well as the materials collected in the course of investigation. Take for instance the case on hand. Multiple FIRs have been registered over a period of time. It is in the background of such circumstances the registration of multiple FIRs assumes importance, thereby attracting the issue of wreaking vengeance out of private or personal grudge as alleged.
13. In State of Andhra Pradesh v. Golconda Linga Swamy, (2004) 6 SCC 522, a two-Judge Bench of this Court elaborated on the types of materials the High Court can assess to quash an FIR. The Court drew a fine distinction between consideration of materials that were tendered as evidence and appreciation of such evidence. Only such 21 2025:HHC:2249 material that manifestly fails to prove the accusation in the FIR can be considered for quashing an FIR. The Court held:-
""5. ...Authority of the court exists for advancement of justice and if any attempt is made to abuse that authority so as to produce injustice, the court has power to prevent such abuse. It would be an abuse of the process of the court to allow any action which would result in injustice and prevent promotion of justice. In exercise of the powers court would be justified to quash any proceeding if it finds that initiation or continuance of it amounts to abuse of the process of court or quashing of these proceedings would otherwise serve the ends of justice. When no offence is disclosed by the complaint, the court may examine the question of fact. When a complaint is sought to be quashed, it is permissible to look into the materials to assess what the complainant has alleged and whether any offence is made out even if the allegations are accepted in toto.
6. In R.P. Kapur v. State of Punjab, AIR 1960 SC 866 : 1960 Cri LJ 1239, this Court summarised some categories of cases where inherent power can and should be exercised to quash the proceedings : (AIR p. 869, para 6)
(i) where it manifestly appears that there is a legal bar against the institution or continuance e.g. want of sanction;
(ii) where the allegations in the first information report or complaint taken at its face value and accepted in their entirety do not constitute the offence alleged;
(iii) where the allegations constitute an offence, but there is no legal evidence adduced or the evidence 22 2025:HHC:2249 adduced clearly or manifestly fails to prove the charge.
7. In dealing with the last category, it is important to bear in mind the distinction between a case where there is no legal evidence or where there is evidence which is clearly inconsistent with the accusations made, and a case where there is legal evidence which, on appreciation, may or may not support the accusations. When exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code, the High Court would not ordinarily embark upon an enquiry whether the evidence in question is reliable or not or whether on a reasonable appreciation of it accusation would not be sustained. That is the function of the trial Judge. Judicial process, no doubt should not be an instrument of oppression, or, needless harassment. Court should be circumspect and judicious in exercising discretion and should take all relevant facts and circumstances into consideration before issuing process, lest it would be an instrument in the hands of a private complainant to unleash vendetta to harass any person needlessly. At the same time the section is not an instrument handed over to an accused to short-circuit a prosecution and bring about its sudden death.....""


18. Hon'ble Supreme Court in Achin Gupta vs. State of Haryana & anr., reported in 2024 Live Law (SC) 343, have elaborately discussed the powers of this Court under Section 482 Cr. P.C. to quash the FIR, in such type of 23 2025:HHC:2249 cases. Relevant paragraphs 18, 31 to 34 are reproduced as under:

""18. The plain reading of the FIR and the chargesheet papers indicate that the allegations levelled by the First Informant are quite vague, general and sweeping, specifying no instances of criminal conduct. It is also pertinent to note that in the FIR no specific date or time of the alleged offence/offences has been disclosed. Even the police thought fit to drop the proceedings against the other members of the Appellant's family. Thus, we are of the view that the FIR lodged by the Respondent No. 2 was nothing but a counterblast to the divorce petition & also the domestic violence case.
31. The learned members of the Bar have enormous social responsibility and obligation to ensure that the social fiber of family life is not ruined or demolished. They must ensure that exaggerated versions of small incidents should not be reflected in the criminal complaints. Majority of the complaints are filed either on their advice or with their concurrence. The learned members of the Bar who belong to a noble profession must maintain its noble traditions and should treat every complaint under section 498-A as a basic human problem and must make serious endeavour to help the parties in arriving at an amicable resolution of that human problem. They must discharge their duties to the best of their abilities to ensure that social fiber, peace and tranquility of the society remains intact. The members of the Bar should also ensure that one complaint should not lead to multiple cases.
32. Unfortunately, at the time of filing of the complaint the implications and consequences are not properly visualized by the complainant that such complaint can lead to
24 2025:HHC:2249 insurmountable harassment, agony and pain to the complainant, accused and his close relations.

33. The ultimate object of justice is to find out the truth and punish the guilty and protect the innocent To find out the truth is a herculean task in majority of these complaints. The tendency of implicating husband and all his immediate relations is also not uncommon. At times, even after the conclusion of criminal trial, it is difficult to ascertain the real truth. The courts have to be extremely careful and cautious in dealing with these complaints and must take pragmatic realities into consideration while dealing with matrimonial cases. The allegations of harassment of husband's close relations who had been living in different cities and never visited or rarely visited the place where the complainant resided would have an entirely different complexion. The allegations of the complaint are required to be scrutinized with great care and circumspection. Experience reveals that long and protracted criminal trials lead to rancour, acrimony and bitterness in the relationship amongst the parties. It is also a matter of common knowledge that in cases filed by the complainant if the husband or the husband's relations had to remain in jail even for a few days, it would ruin the chances of amicable settlement altogether. The process of suffering is extremely long and painful.

34. Before parting with this case, we would like to observe that a serious relook of the entire provision is warranted by the legislation. It is also a matter of common knowledge that exaggerated versions of the incident are reflected in a large number of complaints. The tendency of over implication is also reflected in a very large number of cases.""

19. Similar view has also been taken by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in a recent decision in Yashodeep 25 2025:HHC:2249 Bisanrao Vadode versus the State of Maharashtra & anr., Citation No. 2024 INSC 798. Relevant paragraphs 11 and 12 are reproduced as under:

""11. In the contextual situation, it is only appropriate to keep reminded of the observations of this Court in the decision in Preeti Gupta v. State of Jharkhand1. This Court observed that it is a matter of common knowledge that exaggerated versions of the incident are reflected in a large number of complaints and the tendency of over implication is also reflected in a large number of cases.
12. We are of the view that in view of such circumstances, the courts have to be careful to identify instances of over implication and to avert the suffering of ignominy and inexpiable consequences, by such persons.""
20. It is a trite law that at the time of exercising powers under Section 482 Cr. P.C., correctness of the allegations should not be dwelled into by this Court, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Manik B. vs. Kadapala Sreyes Reddy & anr., reported in 2023 Live Law (SC) 642.

21. In the FIR in question, respondent No. 2 has levelled general allegations, without specifying any date, time or year, when the allegations of threatening to get the marriage of respondent No. 2 with her husband dissolved were levelled and when petitioner No. 2 had 26 2025:HHC:2249 levelled the allegations, which according to respondent No. 2, falls within the character assassination. Whatever has been alleged against the petitioners is totally vague and the same does not fall within the definition of 'specific allegation'.

22. Moreover, petitioners will not be compelled to face the trial, on the basis of alleged deposition of mother-in- law of respondent No. 2 that petitioner No. 1 is a lawyer and he will get the divorce, within no time and nobody can raise finger against him.

23. Alongwith the petition, in the statement of respondent No. 2, recorded under Section 161 Cr. P.C., general allegations have been levelled against the petitioners that all the accused persons used to taunt her for not bringing sufficient dowry and on petty matters, used to torture her mentally. Whatsoever allegations have been levelled, those were against husband of respondent No. 2, her mother-in-law and father-in-law, and not against the petitioners, herein.

24. Similar is the statement made by Smt. Anu, w/o Sarwan Singh, who has also been examined by the Police to substantiate the allegations, levelled by respondent No. 27 2025:HHC:2249 2, against the accused persons, including the petitioners. She has also levelled general allegations, in her statement.

25. In the statements of Jyoti, Raj Kumari, Usha Devi, Mast Ram, Puran Chand, Shakuntla Devi, Sarvan Singh, Ram Singh, Sunku Ram and Rajeev Kumar, recorded under Section 161 Cr. P.C., only general allegations have been levelled against the petitioners.

26. Considering the stand of respondent No. 2, in her statement, made to the Police, according to which, petitioners threatened her and most of the times, they used to reside in matrimonial home of respondent No. 2 and provoke her in-laws to quarrel with her, this Court is of the view that these allegations do not fall within the definition of 'specific allegations', as no date, time or year has been mentioned and these allegations fall within the definition of 'general allegations'.

27. From these allegations, an inference can be drawn that both the petitioners were not residing in the matrimonial home of respondent No. 2. Without specifying these allegations, the above deposition of respondent No. 2 falls within the definition of 'general and vague allegations'.

28 2025:HHC:2249

28. As state above, the petitioners have placed on record the attested copy of statement of respondent No. 2, made in the proceedings under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, titled as, 'Shalini Chauhan and others vs. Randeep Kumar & others. In this case also, petitioners have been arrayed as respondents No. 4 and 5.

29. In the said proceedings, respondent No. 2 on oath, has not uttered a single sentence, against the petitioners. Main thrust of the case was against her father-in-law, mother-in-law and husband.

30. Interestingly, in the said proceedings, petitioners have also been arrayed as respondents No. 4 and 5. So far as the objections raised by learned counsel appearing for respondent No. 2 that the aforesaid documents cannot be taken into consideration, as defence is not to be considered at this stage, is concerned, the said argument is devoid of any merit, as the admitted documents can be taken into consideration, while deciding petition, under Section 482 Cr. P.C. The document, i.e. statement of respondent No. 2, is not in dispute, nor any question can be raised, against the said statement, as respondent No. 2 29 2025:HHC:2249 had made a statement on oath, before the competent Court of law, before which, the proceedings under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, were pending.

31. Considering all these facts, the present petition is allowed and FIR No. 298 of 2020, dated 8.8.2020, registered under Sections 498-A, 323, 355, 504 and 506 read with Section 34 of the IPC, alongwith proceedings resultant thereto, in case No. 179 of 2020, titled as, 'State versus Labh Singh & others', pending before the learned trial Court, qua petitioners Gaurav Chaudhary and Deepali Chaudhary, is quashed.

32. The pending application(s), if any, are also disposed of.

N.Janaki vs The Inspector Of Police ,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/153479827/,"Madras High Court
N.Janaki vs The Inspector Of Police on 8 January, 2025
The issue involved in these cases are common and hence they are taken up together, heard and disposed of through this common order.

2.The criminal original petition in Crl.O.P(MD)No.16823 of 2022 has been filed by A2 and A3 seeking to quash the proceedings in C.C.No. 200 of 2022 on the file of the Additional Mahila Court, Trichy. The same petitioners along with another person have challenged the proceedings in D.V.C.No.37 of 2022 on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate No.I, Tirunelveli, initiated under the Domestic Violence Act.

3.The case of the prosecution is that on 01.12.2013, marriage was solemnized between A1 and the defacto complainant. It is alleged that 80 sovereigns of gold and house hold articles were given to the defacto https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  complainant. On 18.03.2016, the defacto complainant delivered a boy baby.

The defacto complainant has alleged cruelty meted out by A1 and insofar as A2 and A3, it is alleged that they were holding back the jewels and also retained the insurance amount after the demise of A1 and they were also instigating A1. The first petitioner (A2) is the mother of A1 and the second petitioner (A3) is the sister of A1. A1 died during the pendency of this case due to kidney failure and the criminal case is now pending only as against A2 and A3. Insofar as the proceedings initiated under the Domestic Violence Act, it has been filed against the mother-in-law, sister-in-law and the husband of the sister-in-law seeking for payment of maintenance, to provide for rent and to meet out the educational expenses of the child and to return back the jewellery and other important documents and also for compensation.


4.The final report has been filed against the accused persons for the offence under Sections 498(A), 406 and 506(1) of IPC. The quash petition was filed even when the FIR was registered in Crime No.5 of 2020 and an interim order was also passed by this Court. However, the investigation was completed and final report was filed and it was taken on file in C.C.No.200 of 2022 by the Additional Mahila Court, Trichy. Since https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  the final report was filed when the interim order was in force, a contempt petition in Cont P(MD)No.636 of 2022 was filed before this Court and this Court was pleased to close the contempt petition by order dated 08.08.2022. While passing this order, this Court took into consideration the fact that A2 had paid a sum of Rs.29,00,000/- to the defacto complainant and also returned back the gold jewelleries.


5.There is no bar in dealing with the quash petition even if the final report has been filed and this Court can always see if the offence has been made out and whether the proceedings requires the interference of this Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.

6.Heard the learned Counsel appearing on either side.

7.The specific allegations in the final report was mainly against A1. It is alleged that A1 was working in a shipping company and right from the year 2015, there was some misunderstanding between A1 and the defacto complainant. The defacto complainant was also financially helping A1 for his higher studies and for repaying loan amount. That apart, A1 suffered from kidney failure and A2 donated one of her kidney and for this https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  operation also the defacto complainant helped financially. Even after the operation, it is alleged that A1 and the defacto complainant were not in good terms. Unfortunately, A1 died due to kidney failure on 22.06.2021. The allegations against A2 and A3 is that they refused to repay back the amount that was given by the defacto complainant towards various expenses and have also refused to return back the jewellery to the defacto complainant. That apart, allegations have also been made against A2 and A3 to the effect that they only instigated A1 and they did not allow the defacto complainant to live peacefully with A1.


8.It must be borne in mind that during the pendency of the proceedings, substantial amount was settled in favour of the defacto complainant and out of 72 sovereigns which was claimed by the defacto complainant, 50 sovereigns were returned back to the defacto complainant. Hence the focus of the case and the main ground that was urged on the side of the defacto complainant is now with regard to the alleged cruelty committed by them and the alleged instigation of A1 to commit cruelty against the defacto complainant.


9.It is an admitted case that A3 was living in United States. The https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  defacto complainant therefore has taken a stand that various whatsapp messages and videos were circulated which will show that A2 and A3 were repeatedly instigating A1. For that purpose, Crl.O.P(MD)No.SR 48587 of 2023 has been filed by the defacto complainant to retrieve the whatsapp messages by the police in order to establish the involvement of A2 and A3.

10.The death of A1 and the subsequent developments whereby money and the jewels were handed over to the defacto complainant, has substantially watered down the case. It is quite far fetched to allege that A3 was sitting in United States and instigating A1. It is also borne out by the records that A1 was suffering from kidney failure from 2016 onwards and even as per the final report, it was A2, who donated one of her kidney in the year 2018. Hence the family was struggling due to the health condition of A1. Unfortunately, he died on 22.06.2021. Hence to conduct a case at this stage will be akin to flogging a dead horse.


11.This Court must bear in mind the judgment of the Apex Court passed in Achin Gupta Vs. State of Haryana and Another reported in 2024 SCC Online SC 759 and the relevant portions are extracted hereunder ""31. We are of the view that the category 7 referred to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  above should be taken into consideration and applied in a case like the one on hand a bit liberally. If the Court is convinced by the fact that the involvement by the complainant of her husband and his close relatives is with an oblique motive then even if the FIR and the chargesheet disclose the commission of a cognizable offence the Court with a view to doing substantial justice should read in between the lines the oblique motive of the complainant and take a pragmatic view of the matter. If the submission canvassed by the counsel appearing for the Respondent No. 2 and the State is to be accepted mechanically then in our opinion the very conferment of the inherent power by the Cr.P.C. upon the High Court would be rendered otiose. We are saying so for the simple reason that if the wife on account of matrimonial disputes decides to harass her husband and his family members then the first thing, she would ensure is to see that proper allegations are levelled in the First Information Report. Many times the services of professionals are availed for the same and once the complaint is drafted by a legal mind, it would be very difficult thereafter to weed out any loopholes or other deficiencies in the same. However, that does not mean that the Court should shut its eyes and raise its hands in helplessness, saying that whether true or false, there are allegations in the First Information Report and the chargesheet papers disclose the commission of a cognizable offence. If the allegations alone as levelled, more particularly in the case like the one on hand, are to be looked into or considered then why the investigating agency thought fit to file a closure report against the other co-accused? There is no answer to this at the end of the learned counsel appearing for the State. We say so, because allegations have been levelled not only against the Appellant herein but even against his parents, brother & sister. If that be so, then why the police did not deem fit to file chargesheet against the other co-accused? It appears that even the investigating agency was convinced that the FIR was nothing but an outburst arising from a matrimonial dispute.

32. Many times, the parents including the close relatives of the wife make a mountain out of a mole. Instead of salvaging the situation and making all possible endeavours to save the marriage, their action either due to ignorance or on https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  account of sheer hatred towards the husband and his family members, brings about complete destruction of marriage on trivial issues. The first thing that comes in the mind of the wife, her parents and her relatives is the Police, as if the Police is the panacea of all evil. No sooner the matter reaches up to the Police, then even if there are fair chances of reconciliation between the spouses, they would get destroyed. The foundation of a sound marriage is tolerance, adjustment and respecting one another. Tolerance to each other’s fault to a certain bearable extent has to be inherent in every marriage. Petty quibbles, trifling differences are mundane matters and should not be exaggerated and blown out of proportion to destroy what is said to have been made in the heaven. The Court must appreciate that all quarrels must be weighed from that point of view in determining what constitutes cruelty in each particular case, always keeping in view the physical and mental conditions of the parties, their character and social status. A very technical and hyper sensitive approach would prove to be disastrous for the very institution of the marriage. In matrimonial disputes the main sufferers are the children. The spouses fight with such venom in their heart that they do not think even for a second that if the marriage would come to an end, then what will be the effect on their children. Divorce plays a very dubious role so far as the upbringing of the children is concerned. The only reason why we are saying so is that instead of handling the whole issue delicately, the initiation of criminal proceedings would bring about nothing but hatred for each other. There may be cases of genuine ill-treatment and harassment by the husband and his family members towards the wife. The degree of such ill-treatment or harassment may vary. However, the Police machinery should be resorted to as a measure of last resort and that too in a very genuine case of cruelty and harassment. The Police machinery cannot be utilised for the purpose of holding the husband at ransom so that he could be squeezed by the wife at the instigation of her parents or relatives or friends. In all cases, where wife complains of harassment or ill-treatment, Section 498A of the IPC cannot be applied mechanically. No FIR is complete without Sections 506(2) and 323 of the IPC. Every matrimonial https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  conduct, which may cause annoyance to the other, may not amount to cruelty. Mere trivial irritations, quarrels between spouses, which happen in day-to-day married life, may also not amount to cruelty.

37. Before we close the matter, we would like to invite the attention of the Legislature to the observations made by this Court almost 14 years ago in Preeti Gupta (supra) as referred to in para 26 of this judgment. We once again reproduce paras 34 and 35 respectively as under:

“34. Before parting with this case, we would like to observe that a serious relook of the entire provision is warranted by the legislation. It is also a matter of common knowledge that exaggerated versions of the incident are reflected in a large number of complaints. The tendency of over implication is also reflected in a very large number of cases. 35. The criminal trials lead to immense sufferings for all concerned. Even ultimate acquittal in the trial may also not be able to wipe out the deep scars of suffering of ignominy. Unfortunately a large number of these complaints have not only flooded the courts but also have led to enormous social unrest affecting peace, harmony and happiness of the society. It is high time that the legislature must take into consideration the pragmatic realities and make suitable changes in the existing law. It is imperative for the legislature to take into consideration the informed public opinion and the pragmatic realities in consideration and make necessary changes in the relevant provisions of law. We direct the Registry to send a copy of this judgment to the Law Commission and to the Union Law Secretary, Government of India who may place it before the Hon’ble Minister for Law and Justice to take appropriate steps in the larger interest of the society.”
38. In the aforesaid context, we looked into Sections https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  85 and 86 respectively of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, which is to come into force with effect from 1st July, 2024 so as to ascertain whether the Legislature has seriously looked into the suggestions of this Court as made in Preeti Gupta (supra).
Sections 85 and 86 respectively are reproduced herein below:

“Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty.
85. Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.
Cruelty defined.
86. For the purposes of section 85, “cruelty” means—
(a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or
(b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.” ""
12.As held by the Apex Court, the facts of the present case also clearly show that the normal bickerings in a family life has been blown out of proportions and the defacto complainant is trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
13.Useful reference can also be made to the judgment of the Apex Court in Dara Lakshmi Narayana and others Vs. State of Telangana and another reported in 2024 SCC online SC 3682 and the relevant portions are extracted hereunder:
""31. Further, this Court inPreeti Gupta vs. State of Jharkhand(2010) 7 SCC 667 held that the courts have to be extremely careful and cautious in dealing with these complaints and must take pragmatic realties into consideration while dealing with matrimonial cases. The allegations of harassment by the husband’s close relatives who had been living in different cities and never visited or rarely visited the place where the complainant resided would have an entirely different complexion. The allegations of the complainant are required to be scrutinized with great care and circumspection.
32. We, therefore, are of the opinion that the impugned FIR No.82 of 2022 filed by respondent No.2 was initiated with ulterior motives to settle personal scores and grudges against appellant No.1 and his family members i.e., appellant Nos.2 to 6 herein. Hence, the present case at hand falls within category (7) of illustrative parameters highlighted in Bhajan Lal. Therefore, the High Court, in the present case, erred in not exercising the powers available to it under Section 482 CrPC and thereby failed to prevent abuse of the Court’s process by continuing the criminal prosecution against the appellants.""
14.The Apex Court has repeatedly held that the Courts must be extremely careful and cautious while dealing with the matrimonial cases and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  particularly when the complaint is made against the relatives. There is always a tendency to rope in the relatives to settle scores in a matrimonial dispute.


15.Continuation of the criminal proceedings as against A2 and A3 will only result in abuse of process of law since very vague allegations have been made against them which does not constitute any offence and this Court also takes into consideration the subsequent developments which have been recorded supra. Therefore, this Court is inclined to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C.


16.Insofar as the proceedings initiated under the Domestic Violence Act, there is no scope for the defacto complainant to claim maintenance from the mother-in-law, who is already aged about 69 years. Insofar as others are concerned, they are not liable to pay any maintenance to the defacto complainant. The reasoning that has been given in the quash petition will equally apply to the domestic violence case also. In fact, the defacto complainant has also roped in the husband of the sister-in-law in the domestic violence proceedings. The said proceedings is also an abuse of process of law which requires the interference of this Court under Article https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis  227 of the Constitution of India.


17.In the light of the above discussion, the proceedings in C.C.NO.200 of 2022 on the file of the Additional Mahila Court, Trichy, is hereby quashed and accordingly, the criminal original petition in Crl.O.P(MD)No.16823 of 2022 is allowed. The proceedings in D.V.C.No. 37 of 2022 on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate No.I, Tirunelveli, is hereby quashed and accordingly, the civil revision petition is allowed.

18.Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.

19.In the light of orders passed in Crl.O.P(MD)No.16823 of 2022 and C.R.P(MD)No.1167 of 2023, the criminal original petition in Crl.O.P(MD)No.SR 48587 of 2023 is closed.

2. The case of the prosecution is that the appellant and the deceased Suganthi were married on 10.09.2000 and through the wedlock, they had two female children. The appellant is said to have treated the deceased with cruelty and asked her to bring money from her parents in order to settle the debts incurred and that apart, the appellant also used to harass the deceased after consuming alcohol.


3. The further case of prosecution is that on 30.11.2007 at about 8.00 p.m., the appellant came home in an inebriated state https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and there was a wordy quarrel between the appellant and the deceased.

Ultimately, she died on 03.12.2007 at about 11.45 pm.

4. PW1 is the elder sister of the deceased and she received the information immediately after the incident to the effect that the deceased has been taken to Government Hospital, Kilpauk. PW1 along with her husband and children went to the hospital and they found the deceased in a conscious state. The deceased is said to have informed PW1 regarding the reasons for taking such an extreme step.


5. PW11, is the Sub Inspector of Vyasarpadi Police station. He received the information from the hospital at about 10.00 pm https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis on 30.11.2007 and he immediately went to the hospital and found the deceased to be in a conscious state of mind. Hence PW11 recorded the statement of the deceased, which was marked as Ex. P7. Based on the same, an FIR (Ex.P8) was registered by PW11 in Crime No. 531 of 2007 initially under section 309 of IPC.

6. PW11 went to the scene of crime and prepared the observation mahazar marked as Ex.P9 and rough sketch marked as Ex.P10 in the presence of witness. PW11 also recovered MO1 and MO2 from the scene of crime under seizure mahazar marked as Ex.P11.

8. The mental state of the deceased was certified by PW8 who had recorded that the deceased was conscious throughout the period of recording the dying declaration. This certification was marked as Ex.P2.


9. On 03.12.2007, the deceased died at about 11.45 pm and hence, the investigation was taken over by PW12. PW12 prepared an alteration report marked as Ex.P12 and the offence https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis was altered to section 306 of IPC. The alteration report was sent to the Magistrate Court. PW12 conducted the inquest on the dead body of the deceased in the presence of panchayatars at about 8.30 am on 4.12.2007 and the inquest report has been marked as Ex.P13 and the body of the deceased was sent for post-mortem and the post mortem was conducted by PW10.

Intenstine distended with gas, pelvis scalp bones, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis membranes, brain, spinal column intact
10. PW10 gave a final opinion to the effect that the deceased would have died of complications due to 32% burns.

11. PW12 arrested the appellant and recorded his confession in the presence of witnesses and thereafter, he was produced before the Court and was remanded to judicial custody.

12. PW12, recorded the statement of other witnesses and collected all the reports and ultimately, laid the final report for offence under section 498A and 306 of IPC before the Xth Metropolitan Magistrate Court, Egmore. The same was taken on file in PRC No 134 of 2008.


13. The learned Metropolitan Magistrate served the copies https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis under section 207 of Cr.P.C and committed the case under section 209 of Cr.P.C and the case was made over to the Court below.

14. The Trial Court framed charges against the appellant for offences under section 498A and 306 of IPC. When these charges were put to the appellant, the same was denied.

15. The prosecution examined PW1 to PW12 and marked Ex.P1 to Ex.P13 and identified and Marked MO1 & MO2. The incriminating evidence that was gathered during the course of trial was put to the appellant, when he was questioned under Section 313 (1) (b) of Cr.PC and he denied the same as false.

16. The Trial Court on considering the facts and circumstances of the case and on appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence, came to a conclusion that the prosecution https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis has proved the case beyond reasonable doubts and accordingly, convicted and sentenced the appellant in the manner stated supra. Aggrieved by the same, this criminal appeal has been filed before this Court.


17. Heard Mr.C.V.Kumar, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr.L.Baskaran, learned Government Advocate (Criminal Side), appearing for the respondent.


18. In the instant case, the dying declaration given by the deceased must get primary importance since, if the same is completely reliable, this Court need not search for corroboration and the punishment can be imposed based on the dying declaration itself. Immediately after the incident, the deceased was taken to the doctor PW7 working in Government Hospital, Chennai, on 30.11.2007 at about 9.45 pm. He states that the deceased was https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis brought by the appellant. The deceased was in a conscious state and she informed PW7 that she sustained burn injuries due to accident. The deceased was admitted in the emergency ward by PW7. The accident register was prepared by PW7 and it has been marked as Ex.P1. On carefully going through the accident register, it is seen that the deceased had informed PW7 that the burn injuries were sustained by her accidentally at about 9.15 pm on 30.11.2007 and as a result, there were burn injuries in her chest, abdomen, both the legs and the left hand. This statement recorded by PW7 from the deceased can be taken to be the first dying declaration in this case. In this dying declaration, the deceased has not made any complaint against anyone and in fact, it was the appellant who had taken the deceased to the hospital.

19. The 2nd dying declaration was recorded by PW11, who is the Sub Inspector of police, who went to the hospital and recorded https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the statement of the deceased on 30.11.2007 from 11.00 pm to 1.20 am. While recording the statement, the deceased is said to have informed PW11 that she was harassed by her husband daily when he came inebriated after consuming alcohol and that he was putting pressure on the deceased to bring money from her relatives in order to settle the debts and on 30.11.2007, at about 9.15 pm, her husband abused her in filthy language and not being able to take it any more, she committed self-immolation.

20. The 3rd dying declaration in this case was given to the Magistrate (PW9) on 01.12.2007 at about 2.25 p.m. The statement recorded by the Magistrate and marked as Ex. P5 is almost in line with the statement recorded by PW11. It is not known as to why the deceased who did not make any complaint before PW7, subsequently made allegations against the appellant when her statement was recorded by PW11 and PW9 respectively. It must be https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis borne in mind that by the time, the statement was recorded by PW11 and PW9, the brothers and sisters and other relatives of the deceased have already come to the hospital and there is all possibility that they would have had some influence on the deceased.


21. In the light of the above finding, this Court is not able to completely rely upon the dying declaration and hence, this Court has to necessarily look for corroboration.


22. PW1, is the elder sister of the deceased and she has spoken about the regular quarrels between the appellant and the deceased and as to what she heard after the incident when she saw the deceased in the hospital with burn injuries. The evidence of PW2, who is the elder brother of the deceased, shows that there was a lot of debt and the appellant was not possessed with https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis sufficient money. He has also stated that it is the appellant who had admitted the deceased in the hospital.


23. PW3 is the younger sister of the deceased who states that the deceased and the appellant used to have regular quarrels and she does not know the reason as to why they were having quarrels.


24. PW4, is another elder brother of the deceased and he did not support the case of prosecution and in fact, he was treated as a hostile witness. The same is the case with PW5, who is the son of PW1.


25. PW6, who is the neighbour, in her evidence has stated that the deceased was a short-tempered woman and that she came to the scene of occurrence only after the incident had taken place. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

26. A cumulative reading of the evidence of all these witnesses shows that there were regular quarrels between the appellant and the deceased and the appellant was not earning regularly which resulted in lot of debts which had to be settled. That apart, the appellant also was having the habit of consuming liquor and this had only worsened the situation. Therefore, the deceased had certainly faced cruelty in the hands of appellant and the facts of the present case can be brought under Explanation (a) to Section 498A of IPC. Hence, the conviction imposed by the Trial Court under section 498A IPC is sustained.


27. Insofar as the offence under section 306 of IPC is concerned, the prosecution has to prove that the appellant had instigated the deceased to commit suicide. It must be borne in mind that section 306 and 498A of IPC are independent and they https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis constitute different offences. Therefore, merely because an accused has been held liable to be punished under Section 498A of IPC, it does not follow that on the same evidence he must also be necessarily held guilty of having abetted the commission of suicide. In other words, the conviction for offence under Section 306 of IPC is independent and it can never be the consequences of convicting an accused under section 498A of IPC. Useful reference can be made to the judgement of the Apex Court in [Ramesh Kumar Vs. State of Chhattisgarh] reported 2001 9 SCC 618 in this regard.

28. On a careful analysis of the evidence available on record, this Court does not find that the appellant had instigated the deceased to commit suicide. It seems that the deceased got hold of a small bottle of kerosene and had poured it near her abdomen and had immolated herself resulting in injuries in and around the abdomen. The deceased had sustained 32 % burn https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis injuries as per the post mortem report. Such an attempt made by the deceased can be attributed to the poor financial status and heavy debts faced by the family coupled with the fact that the appellant was not having a regular earning and was also an alcoholic. In fact, immediately after the incident, it is the appellant who made arrangements and rushed the deceased to the hospital which is evident from the deposition of PW7. Therefore, this Court does not find any strong grounds to sustain the conviction of the appellant for offence under section 306 of IPC. To that extent, the judgment of the Trial Court requires the interference of this Court.


29. The upshot of the above discussion leads to the conclusion that the conviction of the appellant under section 498A of IPC has to be confirmed and conviction for offence under section 306 of IPC is liable to be set aside.

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

30. The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant is now taking care of the two daughters. The 1st daughter is studying engineering and the 2nd daughter is studying B.A. That apart, the appellant is also taking care of a mentally retarded girl, who was born to another women whom the appellant married subsequently. The learned counsel submitted that the appellant will meet all the educational expenses and he will also perform the marriage of his daughters. If the appellant is sent to jail, the future of his daughters will be very badly affected since they do not have anyone else to take care of them. The learned counsel for the appellant also submitted that the appellant has suffered incarceration for more than 50 days and that the appellant is also willing to pay compensation fixed by this Court.

31. Taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the case and the submissions of the learned counsel for Appellant and the learned Government Advocate, the appellant convicted under Section 498A of IPC, is sentenced to imprisonment for the period already undergone. The appellant shall also pay fine amount of Rs. 15,000/- and in default to undergo 3 months simple imprisonment. It is seen from records that the appellant has already deposited the fine amount and it has been recorded in the order passed by this Court on 13.04.2015 when the appellant was enlarged on bail. The appellant is further sentenced to pay a compensation of a total sum of Rs. 4,00,000/-. The appellant shall take a fixed deposit in the name of his two daughters and deposit a sum of Rs. 2,00,000/- for each of the daughter and the fixed deposit shall be for a period of 5 years. This deposit shall be made on or before 14.04.2023 at Indian Bank, High Court Branch, Chennai and the original fixed deposit receipts shall be produced before this Court. If the appellant defaults in the payment of compensation https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis amount, he shall undergo six months simple imprisonment.

32. In the result, the Judgement and order passed in S.C.No.257 of 2013 dated 30.01.2015 on the file of the learned Mahila Sessions Court at Chennai, is modified to the extent indicated herein above and this Criminal Appeal is partly allowed.

33. Post this case under the caption for “Reporting Compliance” on 17.04.2023.

State of Haryana & Others; (2003) 4 SCC 675. (ii) Nikhil Merchant Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation; (2008) 9 SCC 667. (iii) Manoj Sharma Vs. State & Others; (2008) 16 SCC 1. (iv) Gyan Singh Vs. State of Punjab (2012) 10 SCC 303. (v) Narindra Singh & Others Vs. State of Punjab (2014) 6 SCC 466.

7. In a recent judgment passed by a Three Judges' Bench of the Apex Court in the Case of Parbatbhai Aahir alias Parbatbhai Bhimsinhbhai Karmur and others Vs. State of Gujarat and another, reported in AIR 2017 SC 4843, Hon'ble Supreme Court has summarized the ratio of all the cases decided earlier with respect to quashing of F.I.R./charge-sheet/criminal proceeding on the ground of settlement between the parties and expounded the ten categories in which application under Section 482 could be entertained for quashing the F.I.R./charge-sheet/criminal proceeding on the basis of compromise. Para no. 15 of the said judgement summarizing the proposition in this respect is reproduced below :-

""15. (i) Section 482 preserves the inherent power of the High Court to prevent an abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. The provision does not confer new powers. It only recognises and preserves powers which inhere in the High Court; (ii) The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court to quash a First Information Report or a criminal proceeding on the ground that a settlement has been arrived at between the offender and the victim is not the same as the invocation of jurisdiction for the purpose of compounding an offence. While compounding an offence, the power of the court is governed by the provisions of Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The power to quash under Section 482 is attracted even if the offence is non-compoundable. (iii) In forming an opinion whether a criminal proceeding or compliant should be quashed in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482, the High Court must evaluate whether the ends of justice would justify the exercise of the inherent power; (iv) While the inherent power of the High Court has a wide ambit and plenitude it has to be exercised;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent an abuse of the process of any court; (v) The decision as to whether a complaint or First Information Report should be quashed on the ground that the offender and victim have settled the dispute, revolves ultimately on the facts and circumstances of each case and no exhaustive elaboration of principles can be formulated; (vi) In exercise of the power under Section 482 and while dealing with a plea that the dispute has been settled, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the offence. Heinous and serious offences involving mental depravity or offences such as murder, rape and dacoity cannot approximately be quashed though the victim or the family of the victim have settled the dispute. Such offences are, truly speaking, not private in nature but have a serious impact upon society. The decision to continue with the trial in such cases is founded on the overriding element of public interest in punishing persons for serious offences; (vii) As distinguished from serious offences, there may be criminal cases which have an overwhelming or predominant element of a civil dispute. They stand on a distinct footing insofar as the exercise of the inherent power to quash is concerned; (viii) Criminal cases involving offences which arise from commercial, financial, mercantile, partnership or similar transactions with an essentially civil flavour may in appropriate situations fall for quashing where parties have settled the dispute; (ix) In such a case, the High Court may quash the criminal proceeding if in view of the compromise between the disputants, the possibility of a conviction is remote and the continuation of a criminal proceeding would cause oppression and prejudice; and (x) There is yet an exception to the principle set out in propositions (viii) and (ix) above. Economic offences involving the financial and economic well-being of the state have implications which lie beyond the domain of a mere dispute between private disputants. The High Court would be justified in declining to quash where the offender is involved in an activity akin to a financial or economic fraud or misdemeanor. The consequences of the act complained of upon the financial or economic system will weigh in the balance.""
8. Learned A.G.A. has no objection, in case, the instant application is decided by this Court on the basis of compromise took place between the parties, which is duly verified by the court concerned.

9. Having considered the settlement agreement dated 01.12.2023 took place between the parties and with the assistance of the aforesaid guidelines, keeping in view the nature of gravity and severity of the offence, which are more particular in private dispute, it is deemed proper that in order to meet the ends of justice, the present proceeding should be quashed. In result, dispute between the parties will put to an end, peace will be resorted and relationship between them will be smooth. No useful purpose would be served to keep the present matter pending inasmuch as both the parties have buried the hatchet and as the time passes, it will be difficult to prove the guilt of the accused. The continuation of criminal proceeding would cause oppression and prejudice.

10. In view of the aforesaid pronouncements of the Hon'ble Apex Court and in the light of the settlement agreement inked between the parties, the present application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is hereby allowed. The entire criminal proceeding of the aforementioned case is hereby quashed.

11. Let a copy of the order be transmitted to the concerned lower Court for necessary action.

                     on the mid night of 01st – 2nd July 2003 by dousing herself with

                     kerosene.



                                  3. The trial Court framed charges under Section 498(A) IPC

                     against Abbu Sikkanthar (the first accused) for causing cruelty to his wife

                     Shagaya Iruthaya Mary and charge under Section 306 IPC against Abbu

                     Sikkanthar (A-1) and Punitha Priya (A-2) for abetting Shagaya Iruthaya

                     Mary to commit suicide.



                                  4. The prosecution to prove the charges examined 7 witnesses. 9

                     documents marked as exhibits. 3 material objects were marked. In

                     defence, one document was marked as Ex.D-1.



                                  5. Before the trial Court the accused persons took a defence that

                     PW-4 [Nagabooshanam] the maternal grandmother of A1 gave a police

                     complaint against A-1 regarding 3 cents land earlier bequeathed to A-1

                     through her Will, in which A-1 has put up a construction. Later, she

                     cancelled the will. In this connection, she has also filed a civil suit and the

                     same is pending. While so, from 25.06.2003 to 28.06.2003 A-1 and the

                     Page 3 of 22
                     deceased were brought to the police station for enquiry about the

                     complaint given by Nagabooshanam (PW-4). During enquiry, the police

                     pressurised A-1 to return the land and building to PW-4. Unbearable of

                     this pressure, wife of A-1( the deceased) committed suicide.



                                  6. The trial Court held that the witnesses to prosecution are reliable

                     and the charges are proved beyond doubt. The theory put forth by the

                     defence was negated. The trial Court held that the first appellant (Abbu

                     Sikkanthar/A1) guilty of offences under Section 498 (A) IPC and the first

                     and second appellants (Abbu Sikkanthar and Punitha Priya) both guilty

                     of offence under Section 306 IPC. They were sentenced as under:-

                                  A–1(AbbuSikkanthar):

                                  (i)Section 498(A) IPC: To undergo 2 years Rigorous Imprisonment

                     and to pay a             fine of Rs.1000/- in default, to undergo Rigorous

                     Imprisonment for three months.

                                  (ii)Section 306 IPC: To undergo 6 years Rigorous Imprisonment

                     and to pay a fine of Rs.3,000/- in default, to undergo Rigorous

                     Imprisonment for 6 months. The period of substantial sentence to run

                     concurrently.

                                  A- 2(Punitha Priya):

                                  Section 306 IPC: To undergo 6 years Rigorous Imprisoment and to

                     pay a fine of Rs.3,000/- in default to undergo six months Rigorous

                     Imprisonment.



                                  7. In the Appeal, the learned counsel for the Appellants submitted

                     that the entire prosecution case spins around the statement of the minor

                     daughter of the deceased alleged to have made to her maternal grand

                     father (PW-1) that soon before the incident, her mother saw A-1 and A-2

                     inside the room in compromising position. Wordy quarrel erupted and

                     thereafter, her mother committed suicide. However, PW-7[Ms.Jenifer

                     Buelah] has not corroborated her previous statement made to PW-1. In

                     fact, she has specifically stated that A-2 never been with A-1 either before

                     or after the occurrence. She was studying first standard at the time of

                     occurrence and could not recollect what happened on that day. Hence it is

                     contented that the trial Court erred in holding the appellants guilty of the

                     charges, under Section 306 IPC or 498A IPC, in the absence of evidence

                     about cruelty or before the abetment to commit death.




                                  8. That apart, the learned counsel for the appellants submitted that

                     Page 5 of 22
                     it is admitted by PW-1[Mr.Mariya Joseph] that he was not in talking

                     terms with A-1. It is proved through Ex.D-1 and from the own admission

                     of PW-4 [Tmt.Nagabooshanam] in the cross examination that she gave

                     complaint to the police against A-1 regarding 3 cents of land and the

                     house constructed over it in which the deceased and A-1 were residing at

                     the time of occurrence. The evidence of PW-3 [Tmt.Girija], that she saw

                     the deceased burning inside the compound and she informed it to the

                     mother of A-1, is un natural of any human conduct and unbelievable.

                     PW-3 is close relative of A-1. The deceased is the wife of A-1. Any

                     human being, on seeing a known person on fire will rush to rescue her

                     and not inform some one else and keep quit. Therefore, contented that the

                     trial Court ought not to have relied upon PW-1, who had grudge over A-1

                     for marrying his daughter against his wish. PW-3 whose evidence is un

                     natural and against any human conduct and PW-4 a motivated witness

                     who was litigating with A-1 in respect of 3 cents of land.



                                  9. Relying on the Judgment of the Supreme Court in M.Mohan –

                     vs- State reported in [AIR 2011 SC 1238], where the Apex Court in a

                     matter arising from the petition to quash under Section 482 Cr.P.C has

                     reproduced the observation of the Hon'ble Supreme Court made in

                     Page 6 of 22
                     Bhajan lal case that, “where a             criminal proceedings is manifestly

                     attended with malafide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously

                     instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused

                     and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge”, the

                     learned counsel for the appellants submitted that this is a case which

                     arose out of ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance.



                                  10. The Learned counsel for the appellants further submitted that,

                     PW-7 the child witness had not supported the case of the prosecution.

                     She is the key witness to the prosecution, who alleged to have seen A-1

                     and A-2 moving intimately. She was supposed to depose about quarrel

                     arose between A-1 and the deceased on the fateful day and the presence

                     of A-2 in the house. However, none of these facts are spoken by PW-7 in

                     her evidence. The trial Court erred in relying on the uncorroborated

                     statement of a witness recorded by the police during the investigation

                     which is against the provisions of Section 145 of the Indian Evidence Act,

                     1872.



                                  11. The Learned Government Advocate (Crl.Side) for the State, in

                     response to the submissions made by the appellants' counsel submitted
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
                     Page 7 of 22
                     that, the place of occurrence is the residence of A-1. The cause of death is

                     proved to be self-immolation by the deceased. A-1, A-2, PW-7 (minor

                     daughter of A1) and the deceased alone were present in the house at the

                     time of the occurrence. The presence of A-2 along with A1 is proved

                     through the evidence of PW-3. This witness is related to A-1. There is no

                     element of motive or ill-will to be attributed to the witness to implicate A-

                     2. The plea of the appellants' counsel that PW-3 evidence that on seeing

                     a known person burning she informed the mother of the A1 is unnatural

                     does not carry any merit because she saw the body burning inside the

                     compound of the deceased house. It was midnight, raining and the power

                     supply was off. Under such circumstances, she has called the mother of

                     A-1 which is wholly reliable.




                                  12. Regarding the child witness [PW-7], the learned Government

                     Advocate (Crl.Side) submitted that, this witness was nearly 5 years old

                     when the incident occurred. She was called to give evidence, when she

                     was 16 years old. She had been brought up by A-1 and his mother.

                     Having lost her mother and being grown under the care and custody of

                     her father A-1, it cannot be expected from her to depose against her
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
                     Page 8 of 22
                     father under whose custody she was. Further pointing her evidence, the

                     learned Government Advocate (Crl.Side) submitted that PW-7 only say

                     that she could not recollect the events and blame it to her loss of memory.

                     She has not said anything which will discredit the evidence of other

                     prosecution evidence. This point has been dealt with by the trial Court

                     and held that the defence of A1 is that A-2 was engaged by him (A1) to

                     take care of his daughter (PW-7). When the accused questioned under

                     Section 313 of Cr.P.C, no plausible explanation from them was given.

                     Therefore, the evidence of PW-3 about the presence of A-2 in A-1's house

                     at the time of occurrence stands unimpeached.



                                  13. Regarding the alleged civil suit and complaint by PW-4, the

                     learned Government Advocate (Crl.Side) submitted that Ex.D-1 and the

                     facts related to Ex.D-1 have no relevance to the case under trial. The

                     prosecution through evidence has proved that soon before the death of

                     Shagaya Irudhaya Mary, there was quarrel. This was heard and seen by

                     PW-3 and PW-4. Later, Shagaya Irudaya Mary committed suicide by self

                     immolation inside the compound of her house. The defence could not able

                     to give any plausible explanation for her suicide except the complaint

                     Ex.D-1, which is an event admittedly happened between A1 and PW-4

                     Page 9 of 22
                     not soon before the death but long before the death. Hence, prayed to

                     confirm the trial Court judgment.



                                  14. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the appellant and the

                     learned Government Advocate (Crl.Side) appearing for the respondent.



                                  15. The point to be determined is whether the reasoning of the trial

                     Court to convict the accused pass through the test of Rule of Evidence.



                                  16. The Charge against the accused are for the offences under

                     Sections 498A and 306 of IPC.



                                        Section 498A IPC reads as below:-

                                                “498-A:Husband or relative of husband of a
                                        woman subjecting her to cruelty:- Whoever, being the

                                       related to her to meet such demand.



                                  17. Under Section 113(A) of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the

                     Court may presume that the suicide committed by a woman had been

                     abetted by her husband or by such relative of her husband. If it is shown

                     that she had committed suicide within a period of 7 years from the date of

                     her marriage and that her husband or such relative of her husband had

                     subjected her to cruelty.



                                  18. In this case, the deceased married A1 on 31.05.1996. Her

                     charred dead body was found on 01.07.2003. Thus, in this case, the

                     suicide had been committed by the married woman one month after

                     completion of seven years period.                 Therefore, the presumption under

                     Section 113(A) of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, cannot be drawn.

                     Therefore, the burden of proving cruelty as well as abetment is on the

                     prosecution.

                                  19. PW-1 the father of the deceased had categorically stated that

                     the marriage of his daughter was a love marriage against wishes of her

                     parents. He has given a complaint that when his daughter questioned A1

                     for being intimate with A2, both A1 and A2 joint together assaulted his

                     daughter and poured kerosene and set her on fire. This information he

                     has given to the police, based on the information, he heard from his grand

                     daughter, who was present along with the accused and deceased in the

                     house at the time of occurrence. But, this version has not been

                     corroborated by the daughter of the deceased, who was examined as

                     PW-7 on 03.10.2010 by the prosecution. At that time, she was 16 years

                     old and she was asked to recollect the incident, which she saw on

                     01.07.2003. She could not recollect anything about the incident or how

                     her mother died, except to say that she saw her mother body kept in her

                     grand mother's house and she has been with her father all these years and

                     he is taking care of her.



                                  20. In the said circumstances, it is not prudent to expect a child

                     aged 16 years to recollect the incident happened 10 years ago, moreso

                     when she has been taken care by one of the accused for all these years.

                     PW-3 is the maternal aunt of the first accused. Her residence is next to

                     the accused house. She had deposed that on 01.07.2003 at about 12 'o

                     clock mid night, she heard the noise from the house of the first accused

                     and saw Sagaya Irudhaya Mary burning in the open space inside the

                     compound of the accused house. She saw the first and second accused in

                     the house. On seeing her, both the accused ran away. She informed the

                     mother of the first accused but she did not come out from the house. The

                     police came thereafter and investigated.




                                  21. First Information Report is dated 02.07.2003 registered at 3.00

                     hours. The First Information Report is given by PW-1. He has stated

                     about the illegal intimacy between A1 and A2, which caused mental

                     agony to the deceased. PW-4 (Nagabooshanam) also endorsed and

                     corroborated the version of PW-3 regarding the commotion in the house

                     of the accused on that night of 01.07.2003. She deposed that on hearing

                     the commotion in the house of the first accused, she advised the first

                     accused and his wife and went to bed. The first accused is none other

                     than the grandson of PW-1 born to her daughter.

                                  22. The learned counsel appearing for the appellants contended

                     that the prosecution has failed to prove that A1 had intimacy with A2 or

                     A1 and A2 instigated the deceased to commit suicide. He further

                     contended that there is no evidence to show that the deceased was

                     subjected to cruelty in any manner at any point of time.



                                  23. To buttress his submissions, the learned counsel appearing for

                     the appellants relied on the following judgments:

                                  (i)In Gangula Mohan Reddy v. State of Andhra Pradesh

                     reported in [(2010) 1 SCC 750], the Hon'ble Supreme Court reiterated

                     its earlier view in Gangula Mohan Reddy (cited supra) and has observed

                     that

                                               “15.In   order to properly comprehend the scope and
                                        ambit of Section 306 IPC, it is important to carefully examine
                                        the basic ingredients of Section 306 IPC. The said section is
                                        reproduced as under:

                                                “306.Abetment of suicide.—If any person commits
                                        suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall
                                        be punished with imprisonment of either description for a
                                        term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable
                                        to fine.”
                                               16.The word “suicide” in itself is nowhere defined
                                        in the Penal Code, however its meaning and import is well
                                        known and requires no explanation. “Sui” means “self” and
                                        “cide” means “killing”, thus implying an act of self-killing.

                                       In short, a person committing suicide must commit it by
                                       himself, irrespective of the means employed by him in
                                       achieving his object of killing himself.
                                               19.In our country, while suicide in itself is not an
                                       offence, considering that the successful offender is beyond
                                       the reach of law, attempt to suicide is an offence under
                                       Section 309 IPC.
                                               20.“Abetment” has been defined under Section 107
                                       of the Code. We deem it appropriate to reproduce Section
                                       107, which reads as under:
                                               “107.Abetment of a thing.—A person abets the
                                       doing of a thing, who—
                                       First.—Instigates any person to do that thing; or Secondly.
                                       —Engages with one or more other person or persons in any
                                       conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal
                                       omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in
                                       order to the doing of that thing; or Thirdly.—Intentionally
                                       aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.”

                                                Explanation 2 which has been inserted along with
                                       Section 107 reads as under:
                                                “Explanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the
                                       time of the commission of an act, does anything in order to
                                       facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates
                                       the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that
                                       act.””




                                  (ii)In Ramesh Kumar v. State of Chhattisgarh reported in

                     [(2001) 9 SCC 618], the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that:

                                             “20.Instigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke,
                                      incite or encourage to do “an act”. To satisfy the
                                      requirement of instigation though it is not necessary that
                                      actual words must be used to that effect or what constitutes

                                      instigation must necessarily and specifically be suggestive of
                                      the consequence. Yet a reasonable certainty to incite the
                                      consequence must be capable of being spelt out. The
                                      present one is not a case where the accused had by his acts
                                      or omission or by a continued course of conduct created
                                      such circumstances that the deceased was left with no other
                                      option except to commit suicide in which case an instigation
                                      may have been inferred. A word uttered in the fit of anger
                                      or emotion without intending the consequences to actually
                                      follow cannot be said to be instigation.
                                             22.Sections 498-A and 306 IPC are independent and
                                      constitute different offences. Though, depending on the
                                      facts and circumstances of an individual case, subjecting a
                                      woman to cruelty may amount to an offence under Section
                                      498-A and may also, if a course of conduct amounting to
                                      cruelty is established leaving no other option for the woman
                                      except to commit suicide, amount to abetment to commit
                                      suicide. However, merely because an accused has been held
                                      liable to be punished under Section 498-A IPC it does not
                                      follow that on the same evidence he must also and
                                      necessarily be held guilty of having abetted the commission
                                      of suicide by the woman concerned.”




                                  (iii)In S.S.Chheena v. Vijay Kumar Mahajan and another

                     reported in [(2010)12 SCC 190], the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that:

                                               “28.Abetment     involves a       mental process of
                                       instigating a person or intentionally aiding a person in doing
                                       a thing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused to

                                       instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be
                                       sustained. The intention of the legislature and the ratio of
                                       the cases decided by this Court is clear that in order to
                                       convict a person under Section 306 IPC there has to be a
                                       clear mens rea to commit the offence. It also requires an
                                       active act or direct act which led the deceased to commit
                                       suicide seeing no option and that act must have been
                                       intended to push the deceased into such a position that he
                                       committed suicide.”


                                  24. The trial Court, taking note of the fact that the deceased

                     married A1 against the wish of her parents. It being a love marriage when

                     the deceased found that her husband A1 has developed intimacy with A2,

                     she out of depression had committed suicide. The mental cruelty caused

                     due to the illicit intimacy has led to commit suicide. To hold so, the trial

                     Court has relied on PW-3 evidence, who had deposed that she saw A1

                     and A2 together in the house, when the deceased was burning and they

                     were running out from the house on seeing her. However, PW-3 has not

                     said anything about the instigation or intentional aid or illegal motion by

                     A1 or A2 aiding the deceased to commit suicide. Though the prosecution

                     has proved that at the time when the deceased committing suicide, A1

                     and A2 were present in the house, there is no evidence to show that A1

                     and A2 abetted by instigation or intentionally aided the deceased to

                     commit suicide. Section 306 IPC for abetting suicide has to be held not

                     proved for the reason that the prosecution has not proved that there was

                     any instigation on the part of the accused to force the deceased to commit

                     suicide. The extra marital affair of A1 had caused depression to the

                     deceased, which has led to commit suicide. This extra marital affair

                     causing mental cruelty itself is not sufficient to satisfy the ingredient of

                     Section 306 IPC in the absence of instigation or aiding.




                                  25. Abetment as defined under Section 107 IPC should satisfy, any

                     one of the three requirements namely, instigating to do an act; engaging

                     one or more persons in any conspiracy of doing an act; intentionally aid

                     to do an act or illegal omission. Hence, this Court holds that conviction

                     and sentence of the appellants (A1 and A2) for the offence under Section

                     306 IPC has to be set aside for want of proof beyond doubt.



                                  26. Regarding the charge under Section 498(A) of IPC against A1,

                     the prosecution could able to establish that A1 had intimacy with A2. The

                     intimacy has caused mental cruelty to the deceased and that has led to

                     fight between A1 and the deceased on the fateful night. This has been

                     Page 18 of 22
                     witnessed by PW-3 and PW-4, who are not only neighbouring residence,

                     but also close relatives of A1. Though it is contended by the learned

                     counsel appearing for the appellants that the witnesses are motivated

                     witnesses, this Court finds that their evidence is naturally and not borne

                     out of any ill-motive or malice. They have deposed that what occurred in

                     the house of A1 on the date of occurrence. Because, PW-7 the minor

                     witness had not able to recollect the event which took place 10 years ago,

                     that cannot be a reason to hold that for unknown reason the said Sagaya

                     Irudhaya Mary committed suicide. While the evidence is clear about the

                     fight between A1 and the deceased, immediately before the deceased

                     committing suicide, it is sufficient enough to show that the presence of

                     A2 along A1 on the night in the house had caused the immediate

                     provocation for the deceased to commit suicide. The presence of A1 and

                     A2 as spoken by PW-3 though has not been corroborated, her presence in

                     the house at the time of occurrence to be held as proved in the light of the

                     evidence of PW-3, which is an unimpeachable.



                                  27. As far as cruelty, it is not necessary, it should be physical

                     cruelty, it may even be mental cruelty as found under Section 498 A of

                     IPC. The presence of other lady (A2) in the house of A1 during the night

                     Page 19 of 22
                     sharing her husband is nothing but mental cruelty to the wife and this has

                     been expressed by the quarrel broken out on the night, which is witnessed

                     by PW-3 and PW-4. Soon thereafter, the deceased had committed

                     suicide. Therefore, this Court holds that A1 and A2 had fled from the

                     house offence under Section 498A of IPC is made out against A1.



                                  28. This Court, on considering the evidence and submissions made

                     by the learned counsel appearing for the appellants, allow the appeal

                     partly and acquit the appellants for the offence under Section 306 of IPC

                     and confirm the conviction and sentence to the first accused under

                     Section 498 A of IPC. The sentence of two years Rigorous Imprisonment

                     and fine of Rs.1000/- in default to undergo RI for three months is

                     confirmed. The respondent police is directed to secure the first appellant

                     (A1) and remand him into the prison to undergo the remaining period of

                     sentence imposed by the trial Court.



                                  29. In the result, this Criminal Appeal is partly allowed.

She further denied that due to continuous demand of Rs.5 lacs and threat of filing of false case against him and his family members, accused Durga Prasad went into FIR No. 214/2011 State Vs. Poonam & Ors. Digitally signed by DHIRENDRA DHIRENDRA RANA RANA Date: 2025.01.10 17:13:52 +0530 depression and committed suicide. She denied that since the family of accused Durga Prasad refused to pay Rs. 5 lacs, a false complaint case was filed iin the court.

23.1 PW23 Anand Kumar deposed that deceased was his sister in law (choti saali), who got married to Durga Prasad in December 2010. He further deposed that there was no issue in the marriage of deceased Neelam and Durga Prasad and she was kept well by the accused persons for a period of 6-7 months. He further deposed that his father in law Ramji Verma called him on his mobile phone and told him that there was some problem as accused persons were harassing the deceased Neelam as she had white patches on her lips. He further deposed that he came to his in law's house from where he alongwith his mother in law, father in law, elder brother and younger brother of his father in law went to house of accused persons to sort out the issue. He further deposed that they had asked the accused persons to send deceased Neelam with them. Initially they had agreed but later on accused Durga Prasad stated that the furniture given in the marriage was of inferior quality and also demanded Rs. 2 lacs before taking the deceased Neelam with them ( Durga Prasad ne kaha ki jo furniture shaadi mein diya hai, wo ghatiya hai, Phele 2 lac de dijiye uske baad Neelam ko le jayo). He further deposed that a compromise deed was also prepared but accused persons refused to sign the same and thereafter, they all came back from there and he went back to his native place i.e., Village Bhelkha.

24. PW10 W/Ct. Manju Kumar, deposed that on 19.12.2011, she joined the investigation alongwith IO Inspector Richpal Singh. She further deposed that on that day accused Poonam and Usha Devi came to police station and she conducted the personal search of accused Poonam and Usha Devi. She exhibited arrest memos and personal search memos of accused Poonam and Usha Devi as Ex. PW10/1, Ex. PW10/2, Ex. PW10/3 and Ex. PW10/4.

26.1 PW21 Inspector Richh Pal Singh deposed that on 03.12.2011, investigation was assigned to him. He formally arrested accused Durga Prashad and Munni Lal and conducted their personal search vide memos which are Ex. PWPW21/1, Ex. PW21/3, Ex. PW21/2 and Ex. PW21/4. He further deposed that during investigation viscera of deceased was got deposited in FSL, Rohini on 12.12.2011.

26.2 He further deposed that on 19.12.2011 accused Usha Devi and Poonam Soni were formally arrested. He further deposed that during investigation, FSL result was collected and subsequent opinion regarding cause of death was obtained from hospital. He further deposed that after completion of investigation, he prepared charge sheet and filed the same in the court. 26.3 During cross examination done on behalf of accused persons, he stated that parents of deceased met him for the first time on 05.12.2011 at about 11:00 AM. He admitted that parents of deceased never met him before that or never made any complaint to him prior to that.

32. Per contra, Sh. Dinesh Kumar Pandey, Ld. Amicus Curiae for accused persons have argued that this is absolutely a false case foisted upon the accused persons by the family of the deceased. It is argued that after the death of deceased, statement of parents and other family members were recorded by the SDM and no allegation of dowry demand was put forth by them. They did not want any action against the accused persons but subsequently, they demanded Rs. 5 lakhs from the family of accused persons and when they refused to do so, this false FIR was registered against the accused persons through an application under section 156(3) CrPC. It is submitted that there are serious contradictions between the testimonies of material witness and they SC No. 57364/2016, PS Begumpur Page No. 22 of 37 Digitally signed FIR No. 214/2011 State Vs. Poonam & Ors. DHIRENDRA by DHIRENDRA RANA RANA Date: 2025.01.10 17:14:24 +0530 have improvised their statements to such an extent that they are totally unreliable. Moreover, all of them are interested witnesses being family members of the deceased. Prosecution has failed to prove the fact that deceased was subjected to cruelty soon before her death and resultantly, case under section 304-B/498-A/302/34 IPC remains unproved. Hence, accused persons are not liable by any stretch of imagination for untimely death of Ms. Neelam. It is prayed that accused persons may be acquitted on account of failure of prosecution to prove its case against them.

Thus, the inference which is culled out from the above is that it is for the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.

Accused persons and deceased stayed together even after the alleged dowry demand made on 25.06.2011.

39.3 The contents of Ex. PW1/A also reflects that the bone of contention between the two families was probably the white spot on the lip of the deceased and this is what mentioned at point No. 2. Had it been the case that there was any kind of harassment on the pretext of demand of dowry then it should have been incorporated in the compromise deed. In any case, the relevance of Ex. PW1/A has become insignificant as it was not signed the deceased and her husband and they were happy to stay with each other. 39.4 There are contradictions between the statement of material witnesses qua the alleged demand of Rs. 2 lakhs. PW1 Ramji Lal, PW5 and PW11 Usha have not specified as to by whom the alleged demand was made on 25.06.2011. PW3 Shyama Pyari stated that the demand was made by Durga Prasad (since deceased) and accused Usha Devi. PW4, PW6 Kanhaiya Lal and PW23 Anand stated that demand was made by accused Durga Prasad (since deceased). Therefore, all these persons, who were part of the meeting held on SC No. 57364/2016, PS Begumpur Page No. 29 of 37 by FIR No. 214/2011 State Vs. Poonam & Ors. DHIRENDRA RANA RANA Date:

2025.01.10 17:15:31 +0530 25.06.2011 are not sure as to by which accused the alleged demand of Rs. 2 lakhs was made. Even if it is presumed to be true then it was alleged made by accused Durga Prasad, then is no more in this world and proceedings against him stands abated. Needless to say, the allegations of demand of Rs. 2 lakhs should have been mentioned in Ex. PW1/A as well as statements recorded by Executive Magistrate, if any such demand was ever made by any of the accused on 25.06.2011. Therefore, I am of the considered view that the allegation of dowry demand of Rs. 2 lakhs has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution against the accused persons.
15. Therefore, Courts should use their discretion to determine if the period between the cruelty or harassment and the death of the victim would come within the term ""soon before"". What is pivotal to the above determination, is the establishment of a ""proximate and live link"" between the cruelty and the consequential death of the victim.

43. File be consigned to record room after due compliance.

2. The brief facts, which are relevant for disposal of this Criminal Appeal, are as follows:-


2.1.As per the final report filed by the Inspector of Police, Meensurutti Police Station, before the learned Judicial Magistrate, Jayankondam on 07.08.2009, the Complainant, Mrs.Muthulakshmi, aged 25 years/2008, W/o. Velmurugan (the Accused herein) a resident of Koluthunga Nallur had married the Accused Velmurugan, S/o. Rengasamy three years prior to the occurrence. After the marriage the Accused doubting the fidelity of the Complainant often quarrelled with the Complainant, harassed the Complainant and treated her with cruelty. Due to the continuous harassment by the Accused, the Complainant on 01.07.2008 at about 7.00 a.m. in the morning, poured kerosene on her. The Accused who was present in the scene did not attempt to prevent the Complainant from doing anything untoward. Instead the Accused abetted the Complainant to set herself on fire and handed over her a match box. The Complainant got disappointed and enraged. She refused to receive the match box, instead took a fire wood from the fire and set herself ablaze. The brother-in-law of the injured Complainant, the brother of the Accused, his wife and mother of the Accused took the injured Complainant Muthulakshmi to Government https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Hospital, Jeyankondam. The duty Doctors at Government Hospital, Jeyankondam, referred the injured to Kumbakonam Government Hospital for better treatment. P.W-10 Dr.Radhakrishnan, the duty Doctor at Government Hospital attended the injured Muthulakshmi at Government Hospital, Kumbakonam. He gave intimation to Meensurutti Police Station and also to the learned Judicial Magistrate, Kumbakonam to record the dying declaration of injured Muthulakshmi. The statement of P.W-10-
Dr.Radhakrishnan, who had seen the injured and treated her at Kumbakonam Government Hospital, had given intimation to the learned Judicial Magistrate, Kumbakonam to record the dying declaration of the injured Muthulakshmi who suffered burn injuries. P.W-11 Mrs.Jayanthi, the then learned Judicial Magistrate, Kumbakonam, had recorded dying declaration of the injured Muthulakshmi under Ex.P-3. The Complainant was admitted in the Government Hospital at Kumbakonam, while undergoing treatment at hospital, she died of injuries. Based on the information provided by the Doctor at the Kumbakonam Government Hospital to the Meensuritti Police Station, P.W-13 Sub Inspector of Police, Meensuritti Police Station, Mrs.M.Selvamalar had proceeded to Kumbakonam Government Hospital and recorded the oral statement as Complaint of the injured Muthulakshmi, who had suffered burn injuries. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis She had in her statement stated that disgusted with her husband disowning the child born to them, as not born to him, she had committed self- immolation. Based on her statement, P.W-13 Mrs.M.Selvamalar, Sub Inspector of Police, Meensurity Police Station had registered a case in Crime No.216 of 2008 on the file of the Meensuritti Police Station, for the offences under Section 498A of IPC under Ex.P-6. She sent the recorded oral complaint and the original FIR to the Court of the learned Judicial Magistrate, Jeyankondam and placed the copy of FIR to higher officials including the Inspector of Police and the Deputy Superintendent of Police. Subsequently, the injured Muthulakshmi died. On receipt of death information, the Sub Inspector of Police, Meensurutti Police Station, had altered the charge by including Section 306 of IPC under Ex.P-10 and sent the copy of FIR under Ex.P-6 and alteration report under Ex.P-10 to P.W-12 Revenue Divisional Officer (Mr.A.G.Selvamani) who is the Executive Magistrate to enquire into the death of a married woman within seven years of the marriage and copy of the FIR was also placed before P.W-16 Deputy Superintendent of Police, Ariyalur. P.W-12 Revenue Divisional Officer conducted inquest over the body of the deceased and also conducted enquiry regarding the circumstances leading to the death of Muthulakshmi. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 2.2.From the enquiry conducted by P.W-12 Mr.A.G.Selvamani, Revenue Divisional Officer/Executive Magistrate, he came to know that the deceased died within four years after the marriage. He ruled out the possibility of dowry harassment. He had conducted the inquest over the body of the deceased. He had examined the witnesses and based on the statement of the witnesses, he had come to the conclusion that the deceased died due to harassment meted out to her by her husband and filed his report under Ex.P-4. P.W-16 the Investigation Officer, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Ariyalur, proceeded with the investigation and prepared rough sketch under Ex.P-8 and observation mahazar under Ex.P-7 in the presence of witnesses Raghavan and Mahalingam. The Deputy Superintendent of Police, Ariyalur, had conducted investigation and recorded the statement of the witnesses. The Investigation Officer who conducted investigation at the earlier stage Mr.Chinnayan, the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Ariyalur, died in an accident. Therefore, his successor P.W-16, Haja Moideen, Deputy Superintendent of Police (Prohibition Wing) who was holding Full Additional Charge of the post of Deputy Superintendent of Police, Ariyalur, who was originally the Deputy Superintendent of Police (Prohibition and Enforcement Wing) had completed the investigation and laid the final report. The earlier Deputy Superintendent of Police, Mr.Chinnayan had https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis completed the investigation by examining the witnesses recording the statement of witnesses including Dr.Radhakrishnan, P.W-10 who had seen the injured and treated the injured and also who was the Doctor who certified the mental fitness of the injured while the learned Judicial Magistrate, Kumbakonam recorded the dying declaration and also after the death of the injured, who had conducted Postmortem of the body of the deceased and issued Postmortem Certificate under Ex.P-2. P.W-16 Investigation Officer completed the investigation and laid the final report before the Court of the learned Judicial Magistrate, Jeyankondam. The learned Judicial Magistrate, Jeyankondam, had taken the final report filed by P.W-16, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Ariyalur, taking cognizance of the offence under Sections 498A and 306 of IPC and numbered the final report as PRC No.52 of 2009.


2.3.On appearance of the Accused, the copies of the final report were furnished under Section 207 of Cr.P.C. Since the victim of the crime is a woman, the case was made over to the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, on committal by the learned Judicial Magistrate, Jayankondam, the Accused was bound over to the Court of the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 2.4.The learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur, on appearance of the Accused, after hearing the Prosecution and the defence, framed charges for offence under Sections 498A and 306 of IPC. The Accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. Therefore, the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur ordered trial. During trial, the Prosecution had examined 16 witnesses under P.W-1 to P.W-16 and marked 13 documents under Ex.P-1 to Ex.P-13. After closing of the Prosecution evidence, the Accused was examined by the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur, under Section 313(1) of Cr.P.C. regarding incriminating evidence available during trial against the Accused. The Accused denied the incriminating evidence against him. After hearing the arguments of the Prosecution and the defence, the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur, on appreciation of evidence convicted the Accused for the offence under Section 498A of IPC and acquitted the Accused under Section 306 of IPC. As per the judgment dated 15.11.2016 the Accused was convicted for offence under Section 498A of IPC thereby sentencing him to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for a period of two years and imposed fine of Rs.5,000/- (Rupees Five Thousand Only), in default, to undergo Simple Imprisonment for a period of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis six months.

Aggrieved by the same, the Accused had preferred this Appeal.

3. The learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Appellant is the Accused before the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur in S.C.No.53 of 2016. The learned Counsel for the Appellant invited the attention of this Court to the charges framed by the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur. The first charge relates to Section 498-A of I.P.C. The second charge relates to Section 306 of I.P.C. As the Accused denied the charges, the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur ordered trial. To prove the charge, Prosecution had examined 16 witnesses as P.W-1 to P.W-16 and marked 13 documents as Ex.P-1 to Ex.P-13.


4. The learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that except P.W- 1, all other witnesses turned hostile. The Official witnesses and P.W-1 alone had deposed evidence in support of the Prosecution. Even, the P.W-1 was treated as partly hostile. The learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur had relied on the depositions of the mother of the victim and convicted the Accused for the offences under Section 498A of I.P.C and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis sentenced to undergo a period of 2 years of rigorous imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- and acquitted the Accused from the charges under Section 306 of I.P.C.


5. The learned Counsel for the Appellant invited the attention of this Court to the deposition of P.W-1/Mother of the deceased and to her cross examination by the learned Public Prosecutor before the trial Court and the portions of the cross examination on behalf of the Accused. Also he had invited the attention of this Court to the depositions of P.W-2, the brother in law of P.W-1 (Uncle of the deceased). The evidence of P.W- 10/Dr.Radhakrishnan who had treated the deceased during her period of stay in the hospital as inpatient. P.W11/the learned Judicial Magistrate had recorded the dying declaration of the deceased. P.W-12/the Executive Magistrate/the R.D.O, Kumbakonam, P.W-13/the Sub-Inspector Selvamalar who had registered the F.I.R under Ex.P-6 and proceeded with the investigation. Subsequently, the investigation was handed over to the Deputy Superintendent of Police/ P.W-16 who laid final report of the investigation.

6. It is the submission of the learned Counsel for the Appellant that https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis only based on the evidence of P.W-1 and P.W-2, the learned Judge had arrived at a conclusion thereby recording the judgment of conviction against the Accused for the offences under Section 498A of I.P.C thereby sentencing the Accused to 2 years of imprisonment and fine of Rs.5000/-.

7. The learned Counsel for the Appellant invited the attention of this Court to the discussion of the evidence by the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur in paragraphs 20 to 28 of the judgment. It is the submission of the learned Counsel for the Appellant that the judgment of learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur is perverse and is to be set aside.


8. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor vehemently objected to the submission of the learned Counsel for the Appellant stating that the P.W-1 was the most competent witness to speak about the complaint of her daughter who was suspected of her fidelity by the Accused on the date of the occurrence. On 01.07.2008, the Deceased had immolated herself by pouring kerosene on herself and set ablaze. When the Accused was alleged to have given her the match box, she had not accepted it, but she had taken fire wood from the fire to set herself ablaze. Even though the occurrence https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis took place on 01.07.2008, she was admitted in Kumbakonam Hospital on 08.07.2008. On which date, the learned Judicial Magistrate recorded the dying declaration of the deceased in the presence of the P.W-10/Doctor.

9. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that the P.W- 10/Doctor who had treated her and identified her to the learned Judicial Magistrate was in the Ward till the completion of the dying declaration and had deposed regarding the same. Also, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that the P.W-10/Dr.Radhakrishnan himself had conducted the Post mortem over the body of the Deceased and issued Post Mortem certificate under Ex.P-2. Ex.P-3/dying declaration recorded by the P.W-11/Jayanthi. Even though the Deceased had clearly stated the harassment caused by the Husband of the deceased making her to immolate herself which was recorded by the learned Judicial Magistrate/ P.W-11. The learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur had not relied on the dying declaration under Ex.P-3 and had clearly discussed the evidence of the mother of the deceased stating that the mother of a women is more than a friend. Married women confide or call her and share happiness and difficulties only to their mothers. Therefore the evidence of the mother is found acceptable by the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Ariyalur. Particularly, the learned Judge had recorded that P.W-1 had withstood and cross examined. Her evidence inspires confidence.

10. It is the submission of the learned Additional Public Prosecutor that the R.D.O gave a similar report under Ex.P-5. The learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur had relied on materials incriminating against the Accused from the evidence of P.W-1, P.W-2, P.W- 11, P.W-12 and P.W-16. Nothing can be considered as perverse. The well reasoned judgment of the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur does not warrant any interference. Only on the basis of the appreciation of evidence, the learned Judge had acquitted the Accused from the charges under Section 306 of I.P.C and had convicted the Accused under Section 498A of I.P.C. Therefore the learned Additional Public Prosecutor prays the Court to dismiss this Appeal as having no merit and the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur to be confirmed.


Point for Consideration:

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Whether the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur, in S.C.No.53 of 2016, dated 15.11.2016, is perverse and is to be set aside?
11. Heard the learned Counsel for the Appellant and the learned Additional Public Prosecutor. Perused the materials available before the trial Court through P.W-1, P.W-2, P.W-10, P.W-11, P.W-12 and P.W-16, Ex.P-1 to Ex.P-13 and the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur in S.C.No.53 of 2016 dated 15.11.2016.

12. On perusal of the judgment, the observation of the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur on appreciation of the evidence particularly from the paragraphs 20 to 28 is found well reasoned judgment. Further the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur had the advantage of observing the witnesses and Accused. Therefore, the finding recorded by the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur is to be given due weightage. The submission of the learned Counsel for the Appellant that the judgment of trial Court is perverse, only on the ground that evidence of P.W-1 cannot be considered as she was treated hostile by the Prosecution. That cannot be a reason to reject https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis her evidence, even though the witness turned hostile when there are incriminating materials available, the learned trial Judge has the discretion to consider the evidence favouring the prosecution. The learned Judge had appreciated the evidence of P.W-1/ Mother of the deceased, as the deceased used to confide in her when she was alive regarding her troubles, difficulties. From the point of view of an ordinary prudent man based on our everyday experience. On appreciation of the evidence, the learned Judge relying on the evidence of P.W-1 mother of the deceased particularly the conduct of the defence in not disputing her evidence incriminating the conduct of the Accused as Husband of the Deceased for the frequent quarrel is noted by the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur. In the course of his discussion regarding the witnesses, the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur had observed, “who else can speak about the cruelty of a married woman other than the mother of the woman. It is quite natural for the married daughters to share their marital pleasures and sorrows with their mother. Mother is like a close friend to married daughters. Mother is the only person on whose lap the daughters will seek solace when they were tormented in the matrimonial house. Mother's house is the only place where the tortured daughters would seek asylum. As such the victim, whose character was doubted, who was beaten up, tortured and harassed by the accused came to her mother P.W-1 and told her everything. P.W-1 had noticed the telltale injuries on the face and fingers of the victim even three https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis months prior to her death”.

13. This part of the observation of the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur cannot be rejected by any Judge or ordinary prudent man. Therefore the appreciation of the evidence based on the evidence of P.W-1 alone will be sufficient to convict the Accused. Even though, there were materials in the dying declaration incriminating the Husband, the learned Judge had not considered it as she had not spoken about the abetment. She has spoken only about the harassment caused to her by the Accused denying the parentage of his own child which resulted in ending her life. The learned Judge had recorded the finding after acquitting the Accused for the grave charges under Section 306 of I.P.C. Therefore, the submission of the learned Counsel for the Appellant that the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur is perverse. As P.W-1 was treated partly hostile by the Prosecution, cannot at all be accepted by this Court.


14. On perusal of the judgment, it was considered to be well reasoned judgment. The learned Sessions Judge, that is why he had acquitted the Accused from the grave charge under Section 306 of I.P.C who convicted under lesser charge under Section 498-A of I.P.C. as he had not convicted https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis him based on the evidence of P.W-1 for the offence under Section 306 of I.P.C. The materials available before the witness P.W-1 regarding Section 498A of I.P.C, rightly convicted the Accused for the offences under Section 498A of I.P.C. Also the judgment of the learned Judge had recorded the Accused had undertaken to deposit Rs.50,000/- as compensation to the Mother of the deceased.


15. Considered those facts, considering the judgment recorded by the learned Sessions Judge, the Appeal is partly allowed only regarding the sentence. Instead of rigorous imprisonment, the Accused is directed to release on Probation of Offenders Act for the period of 2 years. The Appellant/Accused is directed to surrender before the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur within a month from the date of uploading of this order.


16. The learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur is directed to release the Accused on Probation of Offenders Act, with warning that he shall not indulge in violation of good conduct. If there is violation of good conduct during the period of probation then he has to undergo 3 years Rigorous Imprisonment as per the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur. The Accused shall be released on Probation of good conduct for the period of 2 years.


17. The Accused released on probation shall execute a bond for Rs.10,000/- along with two sureties for a likesum amount each to the satisfaction of the learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur. One of the sureties shall be a blood relative. He shall execute a bond under the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 . He shall remain on probation of good conduct under the supervision of the Probationary Officer concerned. The learned Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Ariyalur, shall warn him that if he violates the bond, his probation shall be cancelled and thereby he has to undergo the remaining period of sentence of imprisonment as per the judgment.


18. The learned Sessions Judge recorded that the Accused had on his volition, deposited Rs.50,000/- that will not be sufficient regarding the loss suffered by P.W-1. The Legal Service Authority, Ariyalur shall conduct enquiry and pay appropriate amount as compensation under the Victim Compensation Act. P.W-1 was the victim and the Grandson is also the victim. Both of them shall be paid as per the Victim Compensation Act. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

19. As per the Victim Compensation Scheme, the Tamil Nadu Victim Compensation Scheme 2013 (G.O.M.S.1055, Home(Police XII) 30.11.2013) for the life of Rs.3,00,000/- is to be paid to the family of the Victim. Here in this case, the Mother is dependent on the Daughter. The Husband of the deceased is the Accused. The judgment of conviction is upheld by the High Court. On the basis of the same Legal Service Authority attached to the District Court, Ariyalur is directed to issue notice to the Complainant/Mother of the deceased and conduct enquiry and appropriate compensation to be paid. As per the schedule attached to the scheme, the Victim shall be paid compensation, the Victim/Mother of the deceased to be paid accordingly after conducting enquiry.

State Of Gujarat vs Devsibhai Savabhai ,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/92174602/,"Gujarat High Court
State Of Gujarat vs Devsibhai Savabhai on 8 January, 2025
(PER : HONOURABLE MS. JUSTICE GITA GOPI)

1. The present appeal is filed under Section 378(1)(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short ""the Cr.P.C."") against the judgement and order passed in Sessions Case No.109 of 1997 dated 25.03.2003 by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court No.2, Jamnagar, wherein and whereby all the accused were acquitted for the offences punishable under Section 498A, 304B, 306, 201 and 114 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short ""the IPC"").

NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/845/2003 JUDGMENT DATED: 08/01/2025 undefined

2. The case of the prosecution in nutshell is that on 16.12.1996, the deceased committed suicide by jumping into a well due to mental and physical harassment meted out to her by the accused in view of demand of dowry. The F.I.R. for the same has been registered on 18.03.1997 i.e. after much delay of 3 months.

3. Learned APP Mr.Sharma has submitted that the judgement and order of acquittal is contrary to law, evidence on record and principles of natural justice. He has submitted that the learned Trial Court Judge has failed to appreciate the evidence of PW-Dahiben Ramabhai at Exh.13 (mother of the victim), PW-Kadviben Ramabhai and PW-Radhuben Ramabhai at Exh.14 and Exh.15 (sisters of the victim) and PW-Naranbhai Ramabhai at Exh.16 (brother of the victim respectively). It is further submitted that the learned Trial Judge has failed to appreciate that there were direct and indirect evidence connecting the accused with the commission of offence.

3.1 Learned APP Mr.Sharma has further submitted that since cohabitation of the deceased with the accused is only of 2.5 years, presumption under Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 is required to be drawn in the present matter. He has submitted that the allegation is of demand of dowry, which has led to death and where the NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/845/2003 JUDGMENT DATED: 08/01/2025 undefined deceased had taken last step to end her life by jumping into a well. He has submitted that the allegation of the prosecution witness is that the accused were subjecting the deceased to physical and mental cruelty by stating that she has not brought sufficient dowry from her parental house. It is submitted that further allegation is also made under Section 201 of the IPC, which would amount to destruction of evidence since last rites of the dead-body of the deceased was performed by the family members of the accused. Thus, he has urged that the judgement and order of the acquittal may be quashed and set aside.

4. The facts of the case, as established on record, are that the marriage had actually taken place 8 years prior to the incident, while facts detailed out that it was only by customary way for bringing daughter-in-law to the matrimonial house, that she had lastly stayed with the accused for 2.5 years. A general allegation is of abusing the deceased on the ground that she was not well-worsed with the domestic work however, there is no specific evidence on record to state that a specific amount was demanded by way of dowry. The fact also gets diluted in view of the evidence that after marriage for about 6 years, she was at her parental home and during that period, nothing has been brought on record about any such dowry demand.

NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/845/2003 JUDGMENT DATED: 08/01/2025 undefined

5. A clear fact is that the incident of jumping of the deceased into a well and committing suicide is of 16.12.1996, while the F.I.R. has been registered after much delay of 3 months i.e. on 18.03.1997. An inordinate delay in filing the F.I.R. has not been explained by the prosecution witness. The fact also comes to notice that the parents were informed that their daughter has jumped into the well and thereafter, they had come to the place but because of the darkness, body of the deceased could not be recovered from the well and thus, the parents were instructed to remain present next day for procuring body from the well however, they failed to remain present and thereafter, last rites of the dead-body of the deceased was performed at the matrimonial home Hence, there would not be any reason to conclude that the accused have hurriedly disposed of the material evidence as dead-body of the deceased. The evidence also comes before the Court that the accused have sent representative to the parents of the deceased requesting them to attend the last rites of the deceased but they themselves had not attended the funeral. If there had been any instigation or abetment to commit suicide by the accused in view of dowry demand, the parents, at the very first instance only would have informed the police, but no such complaint was filed before the Police Station and it appears that after due deliberation, on a very NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/845/2003 JUDGMENT DATED: 08/01/2025 undefined belated stage i.e. on 18.03.1997, the F.I.R. came to be filed.

6. The learned Trial Court Judge has appreciated the fact that no explanation has been comeforth for the delay of almost about 3 months and 2 days in giving the F.I.R. Such delay cannot be considered as ordinary. The Investigating Officer (PW-6) has also not explained the cause of delay in filing the F.I.R. The learned Trial Court Judge has drawn point of determination for the trial. The allegation of physical and mental harassment has to satisfy the elements of Section 498A read with Section 114 of the IPC however, the same could not be proved since the evidence shows that such allegations are general in nature. Further, no evidence could be found on record to show that the accused had instigated the deceased for suicide for the amount of dowry, and in fact, the evidence is established on record by way of witness that neither such demand of any material thing or amount was made by the accused nor at the time of deciding marriage any such talks regarding dowry was made directly or indirectly.

7. It would be appropriate to refer to the evidence of PW-Radhuben Ramabhai at Exh.15, who is the sister of the deceased. She has very categorically stated and confirmed that the NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/845/2003 JUDGMENT DATED: 08/01/2025 undefined accused had never demanded any money or any material thing from them.

8. Delay in filing the F.I.R. itself shows that no such case was there or no such incident took place, which can cause death of the deceased. The parents have failed to immediately file of the complaint and no further evidence is coming on record, which has rightly been appreciated by the learned Trial Court Judge, of any demand of dowry.

9. The fact of mental and physical cruelty does not come with any specific instance, which could show that the deceased was subject to such cruelty which instigated her to take ultimate step of taking her own life. The averment regarding cruelty appears to be a simple assertion, which has not been proved. The learned Trial Court Judge has rightly appreciated the records and concluded with acquittal of the accused.

10. At this stage, we may refer to the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Ram Kumar Vs. State of Haryana, AIR 1995 SC 280, wherein the Apex Court has held thus:

""... ... ...The powers of the High Court in an appeal from order of acquittal to reassess the evidence and reach its own conclusions under Sections 378 arid 379 Cr.P.C, are as extensive as in any appeal against the NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.A/845/2003 JUDGMENT DATED: 08/01/2025 undefined order of conviction. But as a rule of prudence, it is desirable that the High Court should give proper weight and consideration to the view of the Trial Court with regard to the credibility of the witness, the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused, the right of the accused to the benefit of any doubt and the slowness of appellate Court in justifying a finding of fact arrived at by a Judge who had the advantage of seeing the witness. No doubt it is settled law that if the main grounds on which the Court below has based its order acquitting the accused, are reasonable and plausible, and the same cannot entirely and effectively be dislodged or. demolished, the High Court should not disturb the order of acquittal. ... ... ...""
11. Thus, this Court does not find any reason to interfere with the judgement and order of acquittal passed by the learned Trial Court Judge. We do not find any infirmity in the impugned judgement. The acquittal of the accused is reasonable.

12. While appreciating the evidence on record, the appeal stands dismissed.

Registry to send back the Record and proceedings to the concerned Court.

                                                        JUDGMENT
This Criminal Appeal is filed, against the judgement of conviction and sentence, dated 11.11.2010, made in SC.No.203 of 2008, by the Additional District and Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court No.IV, Ponneri. In and by the impugned judgement, the Trial Court, while acquitting A4, had convicted and sentenced each of the Appellants/A1 to A3, for the offences under Sections 498A of IPC, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year and to pay a fine of Rs.1000/-, each, in default, to undergo three months rigorous imprisonment http://www.judis.nic.in and for the offence under Section 306 of IPC, to undergo three years Rigorous Imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.2000/-, in default, to undergo, six months rigorous imprisonment and ordered the sentences to run concurrently.

2. The Appellant/A1 is the husband of the deceased, victim Devi. The Appellants/A2 and A3 are is her mother-in-law and sister-in-law, respectively. A4, Ramesh is the husband of A3.


3. The case of the prosecution has arisen on the basis of the complaint Ex.P1, dated 05.03.2006, preferred by PW.1/Ramathilagam, mother of the victim Devi-PW.1, who is a resident of Perungalathur, Chennai, alleging that her daughter/Devi/deceased was given in marriage to the appellant/A-1 on 27.01.2003 and that the appellant/A-1, was working as a Welder in Saudi Arabia at the relevant point of time. After four months of marriage, the appellant/A-1 had returned back to Saudi Arabia for his employment. Meanwhile, Devi/deceased had delivered a baby and A-1 was working abroad and her daughter was living along with her in laws. During the relevant period A-2/mother of A-1 had harassed her daughter by several means and that it was informed to PW.1 by her daughter. While so, two months prior to the incident, A-1 came back from abroad and was living with the deceased and after two months, he had indented to go back to Saudi Arabia and at the time, the deceased had informed him not to go abroad stating that she was unable to bear the torture made by his mother. While so, there used to be frequent quarrels with regard to A-1 leaving to Saudi Arabia for employment against the http://www.judis.nic.in wishes of the deceased and that A-2, the mother-in-law had intervened and told the deceased that her son had to go abroad for employment and that if she wants to stay at home, she can stay or she can get away from the home, due to which, her daughter had immolated herself and on information when PW.1 had gone to Kilpauk Medical College Hospital, she had found her daughter with burn injuries and she was unconscious and later at 9.20 p.m., her daughter had succumbed to the injuries. Thereafter, a statement had been given by PW.1 to the RDO stating that there used to be frequent quarrels between the appellants/accused and the deceased with regard to the demand of dowry and that A-1 had not sent money from abroad to his daughter and that the appellants/accused had caused death of her daughter by pouring kerosene and setting her ablaze. Originally, a case was registered under Section 174(3) Cr.P.C and later, after completion of investigation, the final report was filed against the appellants/accused and yet another person (husband of A-3) for the offences under Sections 498-A and 306 of IPC.


4.The case was taken on file in PRC.No.44 of 2007, on the file of the District Munsif-cum-Judicial Magistrate, Tiruvotriyur and subsequently, the case was made over to the Trial Court, viz.,the Additional District and Sessions Court, Fast Track Court No.IV, Ponneri, in SC.No.203 of 2008 and necessary charges were framed. The Appellants/accused had denied the charges and sought for trial. In order to bring home the charges against the accused, the prosecution examined PW.1 to PW.16 and also marked Exs.P1 to P12. No oral and documentary evidence was let in on the side of the defence. http://www.judis.nic.in

5. On completion of the evidence on the side of the prosecution, the accused were questioned under Section 313 of Cr.PC as to the incriminating circumstances found in the evidence of prosecution witnesses and the accused have come with the version of total denial and stated that they have been falsely implicated in this case.


6. The Trial Court, after hearing the arguments advanced on either side and also looking into the materials available on record, acquitted A4 and found the Appellant/A1 to A3 guilty and awarded punishments, as referred to above, which is challenged in this Criminal Appeal.


7. This Court heard the submissions of the learned counsel on either side.

8. The learned counsel for the appellants has assailed the impugned judgement of conviction and sentence, on the following grounds:-

(i) The evidence placed by Prosecution has not proved the guilt of the Appellants/ accused beyond reasonable doubt and that the Trial Court ought not to have believed the evidence of PWs.1 to 3, but ought to have, appreciated the evidence of PW.10 and 11, come to the conclusion that due to the mental depression suffered in view of her husband going abroad for employment against her wishes, the victim had committed suicide voluntarily and thereby, the ingredients of offences under Sections 498-A and 306 of IPC are not made http://www.judis.nic.in out against the appellants/accused.
(ii) PW.1, who is the mother of the deceased, at the time of lodging Ex.P1, complaint, the initial document did not mention anything about the demand of dowry or other cruelty for the purpose of demand of dowry and the later statements and evidence before the trial Court are only improved.
(iii) The enquiry conducted by the PW.10, Revenue Divisional Officer will prove that the deceased did not like her husband going for employment abroad, due to which, she committed suicide. The evidence of PW.2 is also on the same lines.
(iv) In the statement by the victim in the form of a dying declaration given before PW.6, Doctor, there is no whisper about the demand of dowry and torture. In Ex.P8, inquest report also, it is recorded that the Panchayatars have not spoken or complained about the demand of dowry and that the deceased did not want her husband to go for employment abroad and that since he wanted to go for his work abroad against her wishes, she committed suicide.
(v) The alleged demand of dowry and harassment by the Appellants/ accused was not proved by valid evidence and that the Trial Court did not consider the statements and arguments placed on the side of the appellants/accused.
9. The learned counsel for the Appellant would ultimately contend that the http://www.judis.nic.in Prosecution has not proved its case beyond all reasonable doubts, by letting in cogent and convincing evidence and that taking into consideration the overall evidence of the witnesses and the attending circumstances, the impugned judgement of conviction and sentence is not sustainable and therefore, the Appellant are entitled for acquittal. In support of his contention, he would rely on the decision of the Honourable Supreme Court reported in 2014 12 SCC 595 (Mangat Ram Vs. State of Haryana) and would submit that failure to take the wife to the place of employment or posting or going abroad for employment against the wishes of the wife would not amount to cruelty leading to abetment of committing suicide.


10. Per contra, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the Respondent, while supporting the impugned judgement of conviction and sentence, would submit that that the Prosecution has proved its case by adducing clear and cogent evidence and that there are no infirmities or discrepancies or inconsistencies in the evidence adduced by the Prosecution and pray for dismissal of this Criminal Appeal.


11. The learned counsel for the appellants/accused would further submit that the entire case of the prosecution is filled with exaggeration and embellishment. He would further submit that none of the independent witnesses have spoken to about the demand of dowry being made or that the appellants abetted the victim to commit suicide and unless ingredients of instigation/abetment to commit suicide are satisfied the accused cannot be http://www.judis.nic.in committed for offence under Section 306 of IPC and would rely on the judgement reported in (2019) 3 SCC 315 (M.Arjunan Vs.State represented by its Inspector of Police). He would further submit that admittedly, the victim had succumbed to the injuries even before PW.1 would reach the Hospital and that the averments made in the complaint are only hearsay and would have been made only as an afterthought. He would further submit that as per the evidence of PW.7/Doctor, the victim had stated that she had self immolated her due to a quarrel with her mother-in-law and he would submit that even in Ex.P1, no allegations have been made against the 2nd and 3rd appellants/accused. He would further submit that the 3rd appellant/accused is married and living elsewhere and except the evidence of the interested witnesses, there is absolutely no evidence as if the 2nd and 3rd appellants/accused had harassed her by demanding dowry. He would further submit that it is the admitted evidence of PW.2 that the appellants/accused did not take any dowry at the time of marriage and that the 1st appellant/accused married the victim since she was beautiful and that the victim had committed suicide due to disappointment in her husband going abroad for employment against her wishes and there is absolutely no evidence and that the appellants/accused harassed her.

12. In response, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor would submit that there may not be any allegations against the 2 nd and 3rd appellants/accused about causing cruelty to the deceased as per her statement to the Doctor/PW.7 and as per Ex.P1, the initial complaint, whereas, the evidence of PW.1 to PW.3 are cogent with regard to the fact that during the absence of the 1st http://www.judis.nic.in appellant/accused, the 2nd and 3rd appellants/accused used to harass the victim and there used to be frequent quarrels between them. He would further submit that even in the statement given by the victim to PW.7/Doctor, who had admitted her, which would amount to dying declaration, the victim had told him that she committed self immolation due to a quarrel with her mother-in-law, the 2nd appellant/accused.


13. I have given my careful and anxious consideration to the rival contentions put forward by either side and thoroughly scanned through the entire evidence available on record and also perused the impugned judgement of conviction, including the relevant provisions of Law and the decisions relied on by the learned counsel.


14. Now what is to be seen is that whether, the prosecution has proved the charges levelled against the appellants/accused beyond all reasonable doubt and whether the Trial Court is right in convicting the appellants/accused.

15. PW.1 is the mother of the deceased/Devi. She had deposed that her daughter was married to the 1st appellant/accused and that within four months of the marriage, the 1st appellant/accused had gone to Dubai and came back after 2-1/2 years and that the 2nd and 3rd appellants/accused used to quarrel with her daughter saying that no jewels were given to her at the time of marriage and further there used to be disputes with regard to the 1 st appellant/accused/son-in-law going abroad for employment. Further she had http://www.judis.nic.in stated that her daughter used to tell her about the quarrel and cruelty committed on her and that during the year 2006, she received a phone call that her daughter was admitted in Kilpauk Medical College Hospital and when PW.1 had gone there, her daughter was not alive and that she had given a complaint on the next day, which was marked as Ex.P1 and later she had given a statement to the RDO, which was marked as Ex.P2. In her cross examination, she had deposed that her daughter was living in a joint family with her husband and in laws and that the complaint was written by somebody in the Police Station and that she does not know who wrote the complaint and that she had stated there used to be frequent quarrels between her daughter and mother-in- law and that the 2nd appellant/accused/mother-in-law had told her daughter that if only she dies her son can go abroad. She had further deposed that when her son-in-law, the 1st appellant/accused was working abroad, the 2nd appellant/accused, the mother-in-law used to commit cruelty on her and that her son-in-law had come back from abroad and that after two months, he had decided to go abroad once again and it was objected to by her daughter/deceased and at that time, the mother-in-law/2nd appellant/accused had intervened and told her that if only she dies, her son can go abroad.

16. PW.2, is the father of the deceased. He had deposed that when his son-in-law/1st appellant/accused was working abroad, he will not send any money to his daughter and that he will send the money only to his mother, the 2nd appellant/accused herein and further, the 2nd appellant/accused used to torture by various means and that after coming back from Dubai, the 2 nd http://www.judis.nic.in appellant/accused wanted to go back to Dubai again and that when his daughter is objected, her mother-in-law had intervened and told her, if only she dies her son can go abroad. Further, he had deposed about PW.1 giving a complaint and having given a statement to the RDO.

In his cross examination, he had stated that excepting the father and mother of the deceased, all the other witnesses had told him that she had committed suicide since her husband wanted to go back to Dubai for employment against her wishes.

F.I.R was marked as Ex.P11. In his cross examination, he had deposed that prior to the occurrence and registration of Ex.P11, he was working as an Inspector of Police in the same Police Station and that he has not received any complaint from PW.1 or anybody about any harassment meted out to the victim. In his cross examination, he had deposed that the victim had objected to her husband going back to Dubai for employment and that the 2nd appellant/accused/mother-in-law had intervened and there occurred a quarrel between them.

http://www.judis.nic.in

26.PW.15 is the Investigating Officer. He had stated that after registering the F.I.R, he had taken up the investigation and that he had sent requisition to the RDO to conduct an enquiry and thereafter, on the next day went to the place of occurrence, prepared Rough Sketch and observation mahazar Ex.P12 and Ex.P3 in the presence of the witnesses Viz., Murali and Elangovan (PW.9 and PW.10) and thereafter, examined the prosecution witnesses and recorded their statements and during enquiry, he found that the victim died due to the harassment meted out to her and thereafter, handed over the case for further investigation to the regular Assistant Commissioner of Police. In his cross examination, he had deposed that as per Ex.P1 complaint allegations are there only against the 2nd appellant/accused and that the 2nd appellant/accused had told the victim that she should not prevent her son going abroad for employment.


27. PW.16 is the Inspector of Police, who continued further investigation and after obtaining opinion from the Assistant Public Prosecutor, he had filed the final report against the appellants/accused for the offences under Sections 498A and 306 of IPC.


28. Admittedly, the case against the appellants/accused is not for dowry death. As per Ex.P1, the allegations are made only against the 2nd appellant/accused. In Ex.P1, PW.1 had stated that her son-in-law was working as Welder in Saudi Arabia and that he had left to abroad after four months of http://www.judis.nic.in marriage and meanwhile her daughter delivered a female child and she had stated that since her son-in-law was at abroad, she was living with her mother- in-law and that her mother-in-law used to harass her and her daughter used to inform her and that she had consoled her daughter saying that they are not well off and she has to bear with them that if her husband comes back everything will be alright. Further she had stated that when her son-in-law came back two months prior to the occurrence and that when he wanted to go back abroad for employment again, her daughter had told him that his mother was harassing her and that if he goes abroad, she will not be alive and whenever there had been a discussion with regard to her son-in-law going abroad, her mother-in- law used to intervene and say that her son would go abroad and that if it is her wish she can stay or she can go. Due to that, her daughter had self immolated her and that when she had gone to the hospital she had found her daughter in an unconscious state and that she breathed her last in the same day. Whereas, in Ex.P2 the statement given by PW.1, she had improved the complaint and stated that due to demand of dowry, the appellants/accused had harassed her in several ways and that the appellants/accused had set her ablaze by pouring kerosene on her.


29. As per the evidence of PW.7/Doctor, who had admitted the victim as an in-patient, he had deposed that when he had enquired the victim, she had told him that she had committed self immolation due to the quarrel with her mother-in-law. Excepting PW.1 to PW.3, all the other witnesses who have been examined by the respondent police and the Executive Magistrate have deposed http://www.judis.nic.in that the death of the victim was not due to dowry demand. Further, that is the reason why after investigation, the respondents have filed the final report for the offences under Sections 306 and 498A of IPC and not for the offence under Section 304(B) of IPC.


30. Now what is to be decided is that whether the prosecution has proved the charges against the appellants/accused beyond reasonable doubt and whether the trial is right in convicting the appellants/accused.

31. As stated above, admittedly it is not a case of dowry death. The appellants/accused have been charged for the offences under Sections 498A and 306 of IPC. Excepting PW.1 to PW.3, no other independent witnesses have deposed that there was demand of dowry and that the deceased was subjected to cruelty and thereby, she was instigated to commit suicide. It is the categoric evidence of PW.7/Doctor that when he had admitted the victim, she had told him that there was a quarrel between her and her mother-in-law due to which she had immolated herself. Further, as per the evidence of PW.1 and Ex.P1 it is clear that there used to be frequent quarrels between the 2nd appellant/accused and the victim and that the 2nd appellant/accused used to harass her. Though the deposition in the Court with regard to harassment meted out to the victim by the 3rd appellant/accused is an improved version, the prosecution has by the proved that the 2nd appellant/accused has committed cruelty on the victim.

32. In the case of M.Arjunan Vs.State represented by its Inspector of http://www.judis.nic.in Police reported in (2019) 3 SCC 315 the Hon'ble Apex Court has held as follows:-


""7.The essential ingredients of the offence under Section 306 IPC are: (i) the abetment; (ii) the intention of the accused to aid or instigate or abet the deceased to commit suicide. The act of the accused, however, insulting the deceased by using abusive language will not, by itself, constitute the abetment of suicide. There should be evidence capable of suggesting that the accused intended by such act to instigate the deceased to commit suicide. Unless the ingredients of instigation/abetment to commit suicide are satisfied the accused cannot be convicted under Section 306 IPC.""
33. On a perusal of the evidence and materials on record, this Court comes to a conclusion that there is absolutely no material to show that the appellants/accused abetted the deceased to commit suicide and thereby, the prosecution has failed to prove the charge of 306 of IPC against all the appellants/accused.


34. Now coming to the charge of offence under Section 498(A) of IPC, the first document which has come and existence in this case is Ex.P4, the accidental register, as per which, the victim was admitted in the hospital at 5.00 p.m., by Doctor/Natesan/PW.6 and the nature of injury was due to suicidal burns at the residence of the appellants/accused at 4.30 p.m. and the victim was found to be conscious and was oriented.

http://www.judis.nic.in

35. As per the evidence of PW6 /Dr.Natesan, when he had enquired the victim, she had told him that she had self immolated herself and that he had given first aid and admitted her in the Burn Ward. PW.7 is the Doctor, Burns Specialist, who had given treatment to the victim. He had stated that the victim was admitted in the burn ward at 5.10 p.m., and when he had enquired her, the victim had told him that due to quarrel with her mother-in-law, she had immolated herself and that she had sustained 96% burn injuries and that she succumbed to the injuries at 8.20 p.m.

36. As per the statement given to PW.7 in the form a dying declaration, the victim had implicated the 2nd appellant/mother-in-law. Further, as per Ex.P1, the complaint given by PW.1, she had only implicated the 2nd appellant and further it had been stated that the victim used to inform her that the 2nd appellant/accused used to cause cruelty to her. Whereas, in Ex.P2 further statement given to the Revenue Divisional Officer, an improved version had been given implicating the 1st and 3rd appellants/accused.

37. As stated above, it is not a case of dowry death and the finding of the RDO is that there was no harassment on account of dowry and that the victim had committed suicide, since her husband, the 1st appellant intended to go abroad for employment against her wishes. The final report was filed for the offences under Sections 498A and 306 of IPC. Analysing the entire evidence, this Court is able to see that there are no materials against the 1st and 3rd appellants/accused that they have subjected the victim to cruelty. Whereas, the http://www.judis.nic.in evidence of the prosecution is cogent as against the 2nd appellant/accused for having subjected the victim to cruelty and thereby, driven her to take the extreme step of immolating herself.


38. This Court is of the opinion that the finding of the trial Court in holding the 1st and 3rd appellants/accused guilty for offence under Section 498(A) IPC is not proper, as there are no materials against them. Whereas, there is ample evidence against the 2nd appellant/accused for offence under Section 498A IPC and that the prosecution has proved the same by letting in cogent evidence.

39. In 2001 9 SCC 618 (Ramesh Kumar Vs. State of Chhattisgarh), the three Judges Bench of the Honourable Supreme Court had held as under:-

“This provision was introduced by Criminal Law (Second) Amendment Act, 1983 with effect from 26.12.1983 to meet a social demand to resolve difficulty of proof where helpless married women were eliminated by being forced to commit suicide by the husband or in-laws and incriminating evidence was usually available within the four-corners of the matrimonial home and hence was not available to any one outside the occupants of the house. How-ever still it cannot be lost sight of that the presumption is intended to operate against the accused in the field of criminal law. Before the presumption may be raised, the foundation thereof must exist. A bare reading of Section 113-A shows that to attract applicability of Section 113- A, it must be shown that (i) woman has committed suicide, (ii) such suicide has been committed within a period of seven years from the date of her marriage, (iii) the husband or his relatives, who are charged had subjected her to cruelty. On existence and availability of the above said circumstances, the Court may presume that such suicide had been abetted by her husband or by such relatives of her husband. The Parliament has chosen to sound a note of caution. Firstly, the presumption is not mandatory; it is only permissive as the employment of expression ""may presume"" suggests. Secondly, the existence and availability of the above said three circumstances shall not, like a formula, enable the presumption being drawn; before the presumption may be drawn the Court shall have to have regard to 'all http://www.judis.nic.in the other circumstances of the case'. A consideration of all the other circumstances of the case may strengthen the presumption or may dictate the conscience of the Court to abstain from drawing the presumption. The expression - 'The other circumstances of the case' used in Section 113-A suggests the need to reach a cause and effect relationship between the cruelty and the suicide for the purpose of raising a presumption. Last but not the least the presumption is not an irrebuttable one. In spite of a presumption having been raised the evidence adduced in defence or the facts and circumstances otherwise available on record may destroy the presumption. The phrase 'May presume' used in Section 113-A is defined in Section 4 of the Evidence Act, which says-'whenever it is provided by this Act that Court may presume a fact, it may either regard such fact as proved, unless and until it is disproved or may call for proof of it.'
40. In the case on hand, the deceased victim has stated that there was a quarrel between her and her mother in law/2 nd Appellant with regard to the husband of the victim, leaving abroad employment against her wishes. Admittedly, there was no demand for dowry. The evidence on record and the facts and circumstances otherwise on record would suggest that it was not the intention of the 2nd Appellant/mother in law of the victim to abet the victim to commit suicide. However, there is evidence to show that there was harassment meted out to the victim.

41. Further, having come to the conclusion that there are no materials to prove that the Appellants 1 and 3/A1 and A3 have caused cruelty on the victim and that there is no material or evidence available on record to show that the Appellants 1 and 3/A1 and A3 had an intention to abet the victim to commit suicide, the presumption under Section 113A of the Evidence Act being not mandatory, it is only permissive as the employment of expression “may presume” suggests.

42. In the result, this Criminal Appeal is partly allowed. In so far as the http://www.judis.nic.in offence under Section 306 of IPC is concerned, the impugned judgement of conviction and sentence, dated 11.11.2010 made in SC.No.203 of 2008, on the file of the Additional District and Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court No.IV, Ponneri, is set aside against all the appellants and accordingly, the appellants/A1 to A3 are acquitted of the charges levelled under Section 306 of IPC.


43. In so far as the offence under Section 498A of IPC is concerned, the impugned judgement is set aside in respect of the appellants/A1 and A3 and accordingly, the appellants/A1 and A3 are acquitted of the offence under Section 498A of IPC and the impugned judgement of conviction and sentence is confirmed in respect of the appellant/A2 for the offence under Section 498A of IPC.


44. The fine amount, if any, paid by appellants/A1 to A3 for the offences under Section 306 of IPC is directed to be refunded to them. The fine amount, if any, paid by the appellants/A1 and A3 for the offences under Section 498A of IPC is directed to be refunded to them. The bail bonds, if any executed by the appellants/A1 to A3 shall stand canceled. The trial Court shall take steps to secure the presence of the appellant/A2 to undergo the remaining part of the sentence in respect of conviction under Section 498A of IPC alone.

Anil Kumar Tiwari And 4 Others vs State Of U.P.,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/78933682/,"Allahabad High Court
Anil Kumar Tiwari And 4 Others vs State Of U.P. And Another on 8 January, 2025
1. Heard Mr. Sanjay Kumar Mishra, learned counsel for the applicants, Mr. Mayank Awasthi, learned counsel for the State as well as perused the entire material available on record.

2. The present 482 Cr.P.C. application has been filed to quash the charge-sheet No.372/2022, dated 17.10.2022 and cognizance/summoning order dated 23.08.2024 as well as the entire proceedings of Criminal Case No.11551 of 2024 (State Vs. Anil Kumar and another), arising out of Case Crime No.0281 of 2022, under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 I.P.C. and 3/4 D.P. Act, Police Station-Ajitmal, District-Auraiya, pending in the Court of Civil Judge (Junior Division)/Judicial Magistrate, Auraiya.

3. Brief facts of the case are that an FIR has been lodged through an application U/s 156(3) Cr.P.C. on 14.07.2022 at about 00:24 hrs. by the opposite party no.2 against the applicants with the allegations that the marriage of opposite party no.2 was solemnized with son of applicant no.1 on 28.11.2019, according to Hindu Rites and Rituals, in which her parents had given Rs.5 lakhs, jewellery etc. to her in-laws. After two years of marriage, husband of opposite party no.2 suffered from hepatitis and was undergoing treatment at KGMC Hospital, Kalyanpur and P.G.I. A demand of Rs.1.5 lakh as additional dowry was raised by the applicants, which was utilized for the treatment of her husband, however, her husband died on 20.12.2021. After his death, the applicants mentally and physically tortured her. After 15 days of death of her husband, she was forced to leave her in-laws' house and she managed to come back to her in-laws' house after one month, where they harassed her, demanding Rs.3 lakhs as dowry. It has been specifically stated that brother-in-law, namely, Madhav Tiwari has sexually exploited her. On 05.03.2020, the opposite party no.2 was beaten by the applicants and thrown out of the house. She was threatened not to come back without three lakh rupees. The opposite party no.2 shared the aforesaid incident with her family members. Despite the intervention of responsible persons, they refused to bring her back. On 04.05.2022, all the applicants went to parents' place of opposite party no.2 where they abused and assaulted her and also stated that she would not be permitted to come back to their house without bringing three lakh rupees. After investigation, chargesheet has been submitted against the applicants.

4. Learned counsel for the applicants submits that the applicants are innocent and have been falsely implicated in the present case due to ulterior motive. The independent witnesses have also denied any such incident as narrated in the FIR. He further submits that the opposite party no.2 has lodged the present FIR in order to exert pressure for having share in the property of the applicants. He pointed out certain documents and statements in support of his contention. He, therefore, submits that the charge-sheet, summoning order as well as entire proceedings be quashed by this Court as the same is an abuse process of Court.

5. Learned A.G.A. for the State has opposed the submissions made by the learned counsel for the applicants by submitting that from the statement of chargesheet witnesses as well as statement of opposite party no.2 under Sections 161 & 164 Cr.P.C., all the offences under the relevant sections are made out. He further submits that all the contentions raised by the applicants' counsel relate to disputed questions of fact. On the basis of material on record after conducting of statutory investigation under Chapter XII Cr.P.C. by the investigating officer, a strong prima facie case is made out against the applicant for the commission of the alleged incident. In support of his case, learned AGA has placed reliance upon the judgments of the Apex Court in the case of Dilbag Rai Vs. State of Haryana & Others reported in AIR 2019 (SC) 693 and Central Bureau of Investigation Vs. Arvind Khanna reported in MANU/SC/1432/2019.

6. Learned AGA for the State further submits that the statements of chargesheet witnesses have not been annexed from which it cannot be proved that the charge sheet as submitted against the applicants is not proper. In support of his submission, he has relied upon the judgment of Apex Court in the case of Kaptan Singh Vs. State of U.P., reported in (2021) 9 SCC 35. Lastly, he submits that the charge sheet has been submitted on 17.10.2022 and they have been summoned on 23.08.2024. Despite passage of nearly four months, the applicants have not appeared to face trial as such the applicants are fleeing from the process of law without any reasonable cause.

7. I have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the records of the present application.

8. This Court finds that the submissions made by the applicants' learned counsel call for adjudication on pure questions of fact which may adequately be adjudicated upon only by the trial court and while doing so even the submissions made on points of law can also be more appropriately gone into by the trial court in this case. The issue whether it is appropriate for this Court being the Highest Court to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash the charge-sheet and the proceedings at the stage when the Magistrate has merely issued process against the applicants and trial is to yet to come only on the submission made by the learned counsel for the applicants that present criminal case initiated by opposite party no.2 are not only malicious but also abuse of process of law has elaborately been discussed by the Apex Court in the following judgments:-

(i) R.P. Kapur Versus State of Punjab; AIR 1960 SC 866,
(ii) State of Haryana & Ors. Versus Ch. Bhajan Lal & Ors.;1992 Supp.(1) SCC 335,
(iii) State of Bihar & Anr. Versus P.P. Sharma & Anr.; 1992 Supp (1) SCC 222,
(iv) Zandu Pharmaceuticals Works Ltd. & Ors. Versus Mohammad Shariful Haque & Anr.; 2005 (1) SCC 122,
(v) M. N. Ojha Vs. Alok Kumar Srivastava; 2009 (9) SCC 682,
(vi) Mohd. Allauddin Khan Vs. The State of Bihar & Others; 2019 0 Supreme (SC) 454,
(vii) Nallapareddy Sridhar Reddy Vs. The State of Andhra Pradesh & Ors.; 2020 0 Supreme (SC) 45, and laslty
(ix) Rajeev Kaurav Vs. Balasahab & Others; 2020 0 Supreme (SC) 143.
9. ""Fleeing from justice"" refers to the act of accused in evading or avoiding arrest, prosecution, or punishment for a crime. An accused in aforesaid act tries to avoid facing criminal prosecution by often avoiding summons, warrants and other process issued by the court. An accused is legally bound to comply with the summons issued by the court of law except where the process is challenged before the higher forum by the accused. Any person who has been issued process by court of law cannot be permitted to evade the same thereby not permitting the court of law to proceed in the administration of justice. The said act of accused in avoiding the process of court of law without any justification effects the very cause of justice. An accused fleeing from justice without reasonable cause has the effect of stopping/slowing the criminal process of law which effects the cause of speedy justice to the victim or society at large. Non appearance of an accused before the court concerned when the summons has been served (without reasonable explanation for non-appearance) may be indicative of the fact that such accused do not have respect to the process of law.""

10. It is important for rule of law to prevail that the criminal trial is completed without delay. Where an accused flees from the process of law and thereby avoids appearing before the court, the very concept of speedy trial is put at peril and justice to the victim is delayed.

11. The supreme court in Vipan Kumar Dhir v. State of Punjab, (2021) 15 SCC 518 has observed that while granting relief, the possibility of the accused to influence prosecution witnesses, fleeing from justice or creating other impediments in the fair investigation, ought not to be overlooked.

12. While considering the question of whether an accused is fleeing from justice, the conduct of the accused in respect of the process of law is required to be considered. In criminal prosecution when the court find material against the accused sufficient for prosecution, the court issues summons or warrants for appearance to the accused for participation in the trial. When the summons or warrants are served on the accused in accordance with law then duty is cast on the accused to appear before the court concerned except where there exists justification for non-appearance of the accused before the accused. An accused who is served with the process of court and fails to appear before the court concerned without any reasonable cause can be said to be fleeing from the process of law.

13. When confronted with above, the learned counsel for the applicants could not overcome the same.

14. In view of the aforesaid, this Court does not deem it proper, and therefore cannot be persuaded to have a pre-trial before the actual trial begins. A threadbare discussion of various facts and circumstances, as they emerge from the allegations made against the accused, is being purposely avoided by the Court for the reason, lest the same might cause any prejudice to either side during trial. But it shall suffice to observe that the perusal of the F.I.R. and the material collected by the Investigating Officer on the basis of which the charge sheet has been submitted makes out a prima facie case against the accused at this stage and there appear to be sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. I do not find any justification to quash the charge sheet or the proceedings against the applicants arising out of them as the case does not fall in any of the categories recognized by the Apex Court which may justify their quashing.

15. The prayer for quashing the impugned charge-sheet dated 17.10.2022 and summoning order dated 23.08.2024 as well as the entire proceedings of the aforesaid case are refused, as I do not see any abuse of the court's process at this pre-trial stage.

16. The present application has no merit and is, accordingly, rejected.

2. The case of the Prosecution in brief is as follows:-

The Assistant Commissioner of Police, Sembium Range, filed the charge sheet against the appellant/A1 and her son-Balakrishnan/A2, for the offences under Sections 498A and 306 IPC. The allegations in the final report was that the marriage between the deceased-Anitha and the 2nd accused had taken place on 04.05.2001 and that, after the marriage, the deceased was living with the 2nd accused-her husband and his mother/A1, the appellant herein, at Door No.2, Pazhani Aandavar Koil Street, Perambur, Chennai – 11, and that the deceased did not conceive, even after five years of marriage. Due to which, the appellant/1st accused used to quarrel with the deceased and that, she had informed to her father about the harassment by the appellant/1st accused. When the father of the deceased had enquired the appellant, she had scolded him in abusive language and from that day onwards, she used to pick up frequent quarrel with the deceased and that, whenever, the deceased informed her husband/ 2nd accused, he also used to scold the deceased.

3.On 15.05.2006, at about 2.00 p.m., there was a quarrel between the appellant and the deceased with regard to missing of the key of the suitcase which the appellant/1st accused has intended to take with her for her tour programme. When the appellant/1st accused had abused her stating that the deceased had purposely taken the key and hidden it somewhere and when the deceased told her that 'she did not take the keys', the appellant had scolded her by saying “cd;id jtpu ahUk; rhtpia vLf;f KoahJ. bghWf;fp ehna. eP tps';f khl;nl. cd; tapww; py; g[S g{r;rp Tl mjdhy; jhd; ,y;iy vd;Wk;. eP mof;fo nghyP!; !;nlrDf;F nghdtjhnd. ehd; LPUf;F ngha; jpUk;gp tUtjw;Fs; eP tPli ; l tplL ; ngha;tplDk;” and had assaulted the deceased with Chappals and that unable to bear the insult and ill-treatment of the appellant and the passive behaviour of the 2nd accused, in not reprimanding his mother/ appellant about the ill-treatment meted out to his wife, the deceased self-immolated herself on 16.05.2006 at about 7.45 a.m., and died in K.M.C.Hospital, due to the burn injuries and thereby the respondent on the statement of the deceased initially registered a case in Cr.No.604 of 2006 for offence under Section 309 IPC and later when the victim succumbed to the burn injuries, filed the final report against the appellant/1st accused and her son for offences under Sections 498A and 306 IPC.

However, no evidence was let in, on the side of the defence.


10.The Court below, after hearing the arguments advanced on either side and also looking into the materials available on record, while acquitting the 2nd accused found the appellant/1st accused guilty for offence under Sections 498A and 306 IPC and awarded punishment as stated above, which is challenged in this Criminal Appeal.

11. This Court heard the submissions of the learned counsel on either side.

http://www.judis.nic.in

12.The learned counsel for the appellant/1st accused has assailed the impugned judgement of conviction and sentence, on the following infirmities, discrepancies and grounds :-

(a) The trial Court ought not to have convicted the appellant /1st accused for the offences under Sections 498(A) and 306 of IPC based on the evidences of P.Ws.1 and 4, who are none other than the father and mother of the deceased and they are living elsewhere and that whatever deposed by them can only be hearsay evidence in respect of the incident that took place on the particular day.
(b) Ex.P7, dying declaration itself would show that the appellant/1st accused is not responsible for the suicide committed by the deceased and further, there is absolutely no material, attracting ingredients of offence under Section 306 of IPC against the appellant/1st accused.
(c) It is also on record as per the evidence of P.W.3, the neighbour, that there used to be frequent quarrels between the appellant/1st accused and the deceased and that they used to compromise with each other after quarrels and it was the regular conduct of their affairs. Petty quarrels between the appellant/1st accused and the deceased would not tantamount to cruelty either mental or physical and there was no big fight between them, at any point of time. When such being so, the allegations against the http://www.judis.nic.in appellant/accused cannot be held guilty for the petty quarrels and further that there are material on record to show that the victim had assaulted the appellant/mother-in-law on an earlier occassion, thereby, offence under Section 498(A) I.P.C., is not attracted.
13.The learned counsel for the appellant/1st accused would contend that reading of the dying declaration would only infer that the death of the deceased is due to accidental fire and not due to suicidal and it is the admitted case of the deceased herself in the dying declaration that there was a quarrel in the morning, thereafter, husband of the deceased/A.2 had come home and consoled her and gone back to work and thereafter, being humiliated by the conduct of the appellant/accused the victim had poured kerosene over herself and since, she was afraid, she started crying and thereafter expecting that somebody would come and console her had been lighting the match stick and putting it off repeatedly and unexpectedly, accidentally, she set her ablaze. Immediately on hearing the noise, neighbour of the deceased one Ganesan came, doused the fire and saved her. It could be evident from the reading of the dying declaration which would go to show that it is not the intention of the deceased to commit suicide and she had set fire by an accidental act while she was continuously lighting the match box and putting it off http://www.judis.nic.in expecting someone would come and console her and that there was no intention on the part of the appellant/1st accused to abet the deceased to commit suicide.


14.Further, the learned counsel for the appellant would submit that it is the case where no demand of dowry was made and that as per the dying declaration, the deceased herself had stated that immediately after the incident, her mother-in-law came and lamented stating why she had attempted to do such a thing. In such circumstances, the trial Court ought to have analysed the evidences with the other circumstances and having acquitted the husband of the deceased/A.2, ought to have acquitted the appellant/A.1 also.

15.The learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the respondent would vehemently oppose stating that the statement of the deceased is clear and it is admissible in law and that the deceased has spoken about the circumstances and the transaction under which she was led to commit suicide and that the transaction which ensued after the fight between the appellant/accused and the deceased would show that there was wilful conduct of the appellant/accused, which is of such a nature to drive the woman to commit suicide and thereby the appellant/accused is liable for the acts for having subjected the http://www.judis.nic.in deceased to drive her to commit suicide and hence, the impugned judgement of conviction and sentence warrants no interference by this Court.

16.Heard both sides and perused the materials available on record.

17.I have given my careful and anxious consideration to the rival contentions put forward by either side and thoroughly scanned through the entire evidence available on record and also perused the impugned judgement of conviction.


18.Now, what is to be seen is whether the prosecution has proved the charges against the accused by letting in evidence beyond reasonable doubt and whether the trial Court is right in convicting the appellant/accused for the charges framed against her ?

19.P.W.1, is the father of the deceased Anitha. P.W.2-Sampath is the tenant, owned by the appellant/1st accused. P.W.3, wife of P.W.2. P.W.4-Anjalai is the mother of the deceased. Deceased was given in marriage to the 2nd accused and their marriage was taken place on 04.05.2001. As per the evidence let in by P.W.1, it was informed that the 2nd accused was working in Chennai Metro Water http://www.judis.nic.in Board and only after marriage, it came to light that the 2nd accused was running a barber shop. After marriage, the deceased was living with her husband in a peaceful manner only for 6 months and that thereafter, the appellant as well as her son/2nd accused used to pick up petty quarrels with the deceased. Since, the deceased did not conceive, there used to be frequent quarrels and ill treatment of the deceased and that whenever P.W.1 enquired, the deceased had informed that the appellant and her son/2nd accused used abusive language against her.


20.Further, it is the evidence of P.W.1, that during 2003, the appellant/1st accused had attempted to cause injury on the deceased with sickle and that the deceased went and stayed in the house at the ground floor and P.W.1 was informed about the incident by the neighbours. When P.W.1, came to Chennai to see his daughter, she informed the same and they went to the Police Station and gave a complaint and thereafter, the matter was compromised in the Police Station and the deceased started living with the appellant and her son. After sometime, the deceased and 2nd accused lived separately for one year and since, they were unable to pay the rent, they came back and started living in the house of the appellant and that during 2006, when the appellant was about to go for a tour, keys of her suit http://www.judis.nic.in case were found missing and that the appellant had blamed the deceased and that there was a wordy quarrel.


21.On 15.05.2006, a friend of the 2nd accused telephoned P.W.1 and informed stating that his daughter had set her ablaze by pouring kerosene and asked all of them to come to Chennai and on 16.05.2006 at about 3.00 a.m., when P.W.1 had come to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital, to see his daughter, she had told him that it had happened due to ill-treatment of the appellant/accused and after sometime, she died in the hospital. Endorsement made by P.W.1 in the statement of P.W.4 recorded by the Tahsildar is marked as Ex.P.1 and the statement of P.W.4, recorded by the Tahsildar is marked as Ex.P.3.


22.P.W.10-Dr.Subbulakshmi, was the duty Doctor in the emergency ward in the Kilpauk Medical College and hospital, Chennai and she had deposed that the deceased was brought with burn injuries on 15.05.2006 by her husband/A.2 at about 2.15 p.m., and she had informed that the deceased self immolated herself because of the quarrel between the deceased and her mother-in-law/the appellant. Further, the Doctor deposed that the burn injuries were http://www.judis.nic.in seen in the face, both legs and the deceased was admitted as an in- patient and given treatment for the burn injuries. Copy of the accident register issued by P.W.10 is marked as Ex.P.11.

23.P.W.14-Sub-Inspector of Police, on receipt of intimation from the hospital, went to the hospital and recorded Ex.P.16 statement from the deceased and got her left thumb impression in the complaint and thereby registered the case in Crime No.604 of 2006 for the offence under Section 309 IPC. The printed the copy of the FIR is marked as Ex.P.17.


24.P.W.14-Investigating Officer took up the case for investigation and prepared Observation Mahazar-Ex.P.4, Seizure Mahazar-Ex.P.5, Rough Sketch-Ex.P.18 in the presence of the witnesses. P.W.8 is the photographer, who took the photographs at the scene of occurrence and took the photograph of the deceased, after her death in the Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital, Chennai. Photographs taken by him were marked as M.O.2 series.

25.P.W.6 is the XV Metropolitan Magistrate, who had on receipt of Ex.P.6, requisition from the Sub-Inspector of Police, to record the http://www.judis.nic.in dying declaration from the deceased, had gone to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital, Chennai, at about 05.15 p.m., and got an endorsement about the fitness of the deceased in Ex.P.7 from the duty Doctor Damodararaj-P.W.7 and recorded Ex.P.7-dying declaration from the deceased. After recording dying declaration, duty Doctor-P.W.7 also certified to the effect that the deceased was conscious and in a fit state of mind while the dying declaration was recorded.


26.Thereafter, the respondent police received information from the Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital, Chennai, that the deceased had died and since, her death was within 7 years from her marriage, the case was altered to under Section 306 IPC and it was handed over to the Assistant Commissioner of Police-P.W.15, for further investigation. He took up the case for further investigation and sent a requisition to Personal Assistant to the District Collector to conduct an enquiry, whether any cruelty or demand of dowry has made on the deceased. P.W.12-N.Vijayakumar, Personal Assistant to District Collector had forwarded the same to the Tahsildar for further action and P.W.11-Tahsildar, on receipt of the intimation from P.W.12, went to the Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital, Chennai and conducted inquest on the body of the deceased in the presence of the witnesses http://www.judis.nic.in and panchayatars. Inquest Report is marked as Ex.P.12. P.W.13- Dr.Manohar, Professor of Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital, Chennai, had deposed that he conducted post mortem and issued post mortem certificate under Ex.P.13 and the following injuries were found on the deceased, “Epidermo-dermo epidermal burns with denuded cuticle exposing the reddish area seen over the face, neck, both sides of the chest and part of abdomen, front and back of both upper limbs, back of the trunk and front of both thigh (71% Burns). Both eyes are found eviscerated for corneal graft purpose.

No other external or any internal injury are noted.”

27.Further, P.W.13 had given an opinion that the deceased would have died due to Hypovolumic shock and due to burns and thereby, P.W.15-Assistant Commissioner of Police altered the case under Section 306 IPC and arrested the accused. P.W.16-Assistant Commissioner of Police, completed the investigation and filed the final report against the accused. Thereafter, the trial Court framed charges against the appellant for offences under Sections 498A and 306 IPC.

http://www.judis.nic.in

28.In this case, admittedly there are 2 dying declarations, one in the form of statement recorded by P.W.14-Sub-Inspector of Police under Ex.P.16 and another dying declaration recorded by the XV Metropolitan Magistrate, which is marked as Ex.P.7. In both the dying declarations, the victim has stated about the frequent quarrels that happened between herself and her mother-in-law, the appellant herein. In the 2nd dying declaration, though there are minor contradictions in respect of the earlier statement given by the deceased, one thing is clear that there had been frequent quarrel between her and that the appellant/1st accused and that the appellant used to abuse her and that on the particular day, there being a quarrel, the appellant had abused her. On the analysis of the dying declaration recorded by P.W.6-XV Metropolitan Magistrate, this Court can infer that the deceased did not actually intend to commit suicide and she had accidentally caught fire. At this juncture, it would be appropriate to refer to the relevant portion of the contents of the dying declaration.

“....... vd; tPl;Lf;fhuh; vd;id rkhjhdk; bra;J itj;J tpl;L rY}Df;F ngha; tpl;lhh;/ vd; khkpahh; vd;id nftykhf ngrpaJ vdf;F mrp';fkhf ,Ue;jJ/ vdf;F mtkhdkhf ,Ue;jjhy; ehnd vd; kPJ bfurpid Cw;wpf; bfhz;nld;/ bfhSj;jpf;bfhs;s gakhf ,Ue;jjhy; rj;jk; nghl;L mGJ bfhz;oUe;njd;/ mg;nghJk; ahUk; tutpy;iy/ tj;jpf;Fr;rpia Vw;wp g[lit kPJ gw;w http://www.judis.nic.in itj;J. gw;w itj;J mizj;Jf; bfhz;oUe;njd;/ mg;nghJ jpObud;W vd;kPJ beUg;g[ ntfkhf gpoj;Jf; bfhz;lJ/ vjph; tPl;oypUe;Jk; fnzrd; vd;gth; Xo te;J jPia mizj;jhh;/ vd; khkpahh; mg;nghJ te;J ehd; vd;d brhd;ndd;. rhtpia vLj;jhah vd;W jhnd nfl;nld; vd;W brhd;dhh;/ Mdhy; mth; jpl;oajhy; jhd; ehd; bfhSj;jpf;fpl;nld; mt;tst[jhd;/“

29. It is appropriate to refer to Section 306 IPC:-

“20.Section 306 of the Code prescribes the punishment for abetment of suicide and is designed thus:
“306.Abetment of suicide. – If any person commits suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.”
30.The ingredients of abetment of suicide are as follows:-

The prosecution has to prove-
(i)the deceased committed suicide;
(ii)the accused instigated or abetted for committing suicide and that
(iii)there was direct involvement by the accused in such abetment or instigation.
http://www.judis.nic.in

31. Before Section 306 of IPC can be acted upon, there must be clear proof of the fact that the death in question was a suicidal death. The offence of 'abetment' must conform to the definition of that term as given in Section 107 of IPC, that is to say, there must be instigation, cooperation or intentional assistance given to the commission of suicide. It is not necessary or indeed is it a part of the definition that the suicide should have been committed in consequence of the abetment.


32.Admittedly, it is not a case of dowry death. As stated above the ingredients, the prosecution has to prove that the victim committed suicide and that the accused abetted the suicide. While analysing the dying declaration, the victim had stated that she was lighting the match stick and putting it off repeatedly expecting that somebody would come and console her, whereas suddenly the match stick lit the saree and thereby she caught fire, inferring that the victim caught fire accidentally and the death is not suicide. Further the term instigation under Section 107 IPC, explained in Chitresh Kumar Chopra Vs. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) as follows:-

“16.Speaking for the three Judge Bench in Ramesh Kumar case [(2001) 9 SCC 618 : 2002 SCC (Cri) 1088], R.C.Lahoti, J. (as His Lordship then was) http://www.judis.nic.in said that instigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or encourage to do “an act”. To satisfy the requirement of “instigation”, though it is not necessary that actual words must be used to that effect or what constitutes “instigation” must necessarily and specifically be suggestive of the consequence. Yet a reasonable certainty to incite the consequence must be capable of being spelt out.
Where the accused had, by his acts or omission or by a continued course of conduct, created such circumstances that the deceased was left with no other option except to commit suicide, in which case, an “instigation” may have to be inferred. A word uttered in a fit of anger or emotion without intending the consequences to actually follow, cannot be said to be instigation.

17.Thus, to constitute “instigation”, a person who instigates another has to provoke, incite, urge or encourage the doing of an act by the other by “goading” or “urging forward”. The dictionary meaning of the word “goad” is “a thing that stimulates someone into action; provoke to action or reaction” (see Concise Oxford English Dictionary); “to keep irritating or annoying somebody until he reacts” (see Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, 7th Edn.).”

10.Words uttered in a fit of anger or omission without any intention cannot be termed as instigation. (See Praveen Pradhan Vs. State of Uttaranchal).” http://www.judis.nic.in

33.The same view has been taken by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the recent decision of M.Arjunan Vs. The State rep. By its Inspector of Police (Crl.Appeal.No.1550 of 2018, dated 04.12.2018) (Crl.Appeal.No.1550 of 2018) “8. The essential ingredients of the offence under Section 306 IPC are (i) the abetment : (ii) the intention of the accused to aid or instigate or abet the accused to commit suicide. The act of the accused, however, insulting the deceased by using abusive language will not, by itself, constitute the abetment of suicide. There should be evidence capable of suggesting that the accused intended by such act to instigate the deceased to commit suicide. Unless t he ingredients of instigation / abetment to commit suicide are satisfied, accused cannot be convicted under Section 306 IPC.”

34.At this juncture, the learned counsel for the appellant would submit that though this Court may not place relevance on the statement recorded during Revenue Divisional Officer enquiry, it is the admitted statement of P.W.2-Kowsalya, the tenant, that the deceased also assaulted her mother-in-law, which resulted the appellant to use abusive language on the deceased. So, the entire http://www.judis.nic.in circumstances leading to the death of the victim/deceased cannot be attributed to the appellant alone and further, he would submit that it is the statement of the deceased herself that immediately after the occurrence, the appellant had lamented about the conduct of the deceased for having committed such an act that the appellant did not have the intention or motive to drive the victim to commit suicide and that the reason for the death of the victim could not be due to suicide.


35.While analysing the evidence on record, with reference to the Judgment referred above, it can be inferred that the victim/deceased did not intend to commit suicide. As stated in the dying declaration she had been lighting the match stick and putting it off and was crying, expecting that somebody would come and console her. While she was lighting the match stick and putting it off, she had accidentally lit the fire on her saree, resulting in her sustaining burn injuries, ultimately leading to her death. Further, it is the statement of the victim/deceased that the appellant/1st accused rushed to place and lamented saying why she had done that and that she had only asked for the keys. Admittedly, there used to be frequent quarrels between the appellant/mother-in-law and the deceased/daughter-in- law, and that there is also evidence that the victim had earlier http://www.judis.nic.in assaulted the appellant/1st accused. When such being so, the words uttered by the appellant/1st accused can only be taken as words uttered in a fit of anger or omission without any intention to instigate the victim/deceased to commit suicide. However perusal and reading of the evidence on record makes out charges against the accused for offences under Section 498A IPC.


36.In the light of the decisions referred and the reasons stated above, this Court is of the considered view that the Prosecution has miserably failed to prove the guilt of the accused under Section 306 of IPC and however, taking into consideration the evidences in totality, this Court is of the opinion that the prosecution has proved the charges against the appellant/1st accused for having committed offence under Section 498A IPC, thereby this Court while setting aside the conviction for offence under Section 306 IPC, confirms the conviction for offence under Section 498A IPC.

37.In the result, this Criminal Appeal is partly allowed. The impugned judgement of conviction and sentence, dated 12.05.2010 made in S.C.No.401 of 2007, on the file of the Magalir Neethimandram, Chennai, is set aside in respect of the offence under http://www.judis.nic.in Section 306 of IPC alone. The Appellant/1st accused is acquitted from the charges levelled against her for the offence under Section 306 IPC alone. The fine amount, if any, paid by the appellant for the offence under Section 306 IPC is directed to be refunded to her. However, in respect of the offence under Section 498A IPC, while confirming the conviction under Section 498A of IPC, the period of sentence is modified to the period already under gone by the appellant/1st accused.

28..04.2019 and the present FIR has been lodged by respondent No. 2 against the petitioners for harassment on 25.01.2020.

                                                            ORDER
The present revision is filed by the petitioner against the order dated 06.11.2023 passed by the learned XVII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai in Crl.M.P.No.9030 of 2023.


2. The case of the petitioners is that, the marriage of 1st petitioner and 2nd respondent was solemnised on 22.06.2019 and one female child, namely V.Ahana Reddy was born from and out of the wedlock between the 1st petitioner and the 2nd respondent and there was a matrimonial dispute in between them. Thereafter, the 2nd respondent filed a complaint as against the petitioners before the 1st respondent police and a case in Crime No.24 of 2021 has been registered and subsequently, the final report was filed against the petitioners for the offences u/s 498A, 406, 294(b) r/w 34 of IPC and Section 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 on https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 19.01.2023 in C.C.No.295 of 2023 on the file of the learned XVII Metropolitan Magistrate at Saidapet, Chennai, in which, the petitioners have filed a discharge petition u/s 239 of Cr.P.C. in Crl.M.P.No.9030 of 2023 in C.C.No.295 of 2023. The trial court, vide impugned order dated 06.11.2023 had partly allowed the said petition by discharging the petitioners from the offences u/s 294(b), 406 IPC and Section 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 and proceeded to frame charge u/s 498A of IPC. Challenging the same, the present revision has been filed by the petitioners.


3. Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioners submitted that, after registration of the FIR, memorandum of compromise dated 12.08.2022 was entered between the 1st petitioner and the 2nd respondent and as per the terms and conditions of the said memorandum of compromise, the 2nd respondent agreed to withdraw the complaint filed against the petitioners in Crime No.24 of 2021 on the file of the 1st respondent. In the said memo, the 2nd respondent herself made an endorsement in handwriting only subject to the honouring the terms of this compromise. Further, the memorandum of compromise reveals that https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the 1st petitioner agreed to pay Rs.20,80,000/- to the 2nd respondent and a part payment of Rs.8,00,000/- was paid to the 2nd respondent on 12.08.2022 itself and agreed to pay the remaining agreed amount of Rs.12,80,000/- and return the gold articles and silver articles. Subsequently, a supplementary agreement was entered between the parties on 07.09.2022, which reveals that after the sum of Rs.8 lakhs paid to the 2nd respondent on 12.08.2022, another sum of Rs.12,80,000/- was paid to the 2nd respondent on 23.08.2022 and 24 sovereign gold jewels were returned to the 2nd respondent and a sum of Rs.19,76,000/- was fixed as compensation in terms of value of the remaining 52 sovereign gold jewels and silver articles were also paid to the 2 nd respondent on 07.09.2022. Though the 1st petitioner has paid about Rs.40,00,0000/- to the 2nd respondent, however, the 2nd respondent refused to withdraw the complaint filed against the petitioners, thereby the 1st respondent police proceed with the complaint filed by the 2nd respondent and filed the final report on 19.01.2023. Therefore, the petitioners filed discharge petition before the trial court. Though the trial court had arrived at a conclusion that no material is available to implicate the petitioners for the offence u/s 498A of IPC, however, they proceeded to frame charge u/s 498A of IPC https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis against the petitioners. In respect of Sections 406, 294(b) r/w 34 of IPC and Section 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act, the trial court discharged the petitioners. Accordingly, he prays for appropriate orders in respect of the charge framed u/s 498A of IPC against the petitioners.

4. Learned counsel appearing for the 2nd respondent submitted that, by considering all the materials available on record, the trial court has passed the impugned order, which is wholly sustainable and the same does not require any interference. However, on instructions, he submitted that this court may grant liberty to the 2nd respondent to workout the remedy in the manner known to law in respect of the maintenance to herself and the minor daughter.


5. Heard learned counsel appearing for the parties and perused the materials available on record.


6. Admittedly, the 1st petitioner is the husband and the 2 nd respondent is the wife and out of their wedlock, they were blessed with a daughter namely V.Ahana Reddy. It is seen from the records that, due to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis matrimonial dispute, the 2nd respondent has filed a complaint against the petitioners in Crime No.24 of 2021 and the 1st petitioner was arrested on 12.08.2022, thereby he preferred a bail application in Crl.M.P.No.12992 of 2022 before the learned XVII Metropolitan Magistrate at Saidapet, Chennai. On the same day, i.e., 12.08.2022, the 1 st petitioner has paid a sum of Rs.8,00,000/- to the 2nd respondent by entering into memorandum of compromise dated 12.08.2022, in which, it is agreed between the 1st petitioner and the 2nd respondent that the 2nd respondent will withdraw the complaint filed against the petitioners on compliance of the terms of the memorandum of compromise by the 1st petitioner. Based on which, the trial court released the 1st petitioner on interim bail giving one month time to comply with the terms of the said memorandum of compromise. Thereafter, on 12.09.2022, the parties have submitted the supplementary agreement dated 07.09.2022 before the trial court, which revealed that after the sum of Rs.8 lakhs paid to the 2 nd respondent on 12.08.2022, another sum of Rs.12,80,000/- was paid to the 2nd respondent on 23.08.2022 and then 24 sovereign gold jewels were returned to the 2 nd respondent and a sum of Rs.19,76,000/- fixed as compensation in terms of value of the remaining 52 sovereign gold jewels and silver articles were https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis also paid to the 2nd respondent on 07.09.2022 and by considering the supplementary agreement dated 07.09.2022, the trial court has released the 1st petitioner on bail. On 19.01.2023, final report was filed u/s 498A, 406, 294(b) r/w 34 of IPC and Section 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act against the petitioners and the same was taken on file in C.C.No.295 of 2023, in which, the petitioners have a filed a discharge petition in Crl.M.P.No.9030 of 2023 and the same was partly allowed by the trial court vide impugned order by discharging the petitioners from the offence u/s 294(b), 406 IPC and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act and proceeded to frame charge u/s 498A of IPC against the petitioners.

7. It is seen that both the 1 st petitioner and the 2nd respondent have signed the memorandum of compromise dated 12.08.2022 and supplementary agreement dated 07.09.2022 before the trial court, when the bail application was moved by the 1st petitioner before the trial court. From a perusal of the impugned order passed by the trial court, it is seen that the trial court has discharged the petitioners from the offences u/s 294(b), 406 IPC and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, since the 2 nd respondent has received the amount and other gold and silver articles as https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis per the terms of the said memorandum of compromise and supplementary agreement and there is no material to proceed under those sections, which is wholly sustainable and the same does not require any interference.

8. As far as the offence u/s 498A IPC is concerned, no material evidence nor materials to substantiate the allegation that the 2 nd respondent was subjected to physical or mental cruelty, was produced by the investigating officer before the trial court. Further, it is alleged by the 2nd respondent that, in the matrimonial house, the petitioners have demanded dowry and harrasssed her for more dowry, however in order to prove the same, no one from the neighbourhood in Visakapatinam seems to have been enquired by the investigating officer. Hence, this court is of the view that, though there is no material to presume that the offence u/s 498A IPC was committed by the petitioners, however, the trial court has framed charge u/s 498A IPC as against the petitioners, which is per se unsustainable. Therefore, this court is inclined to interfere with the impugned order passed by the trial court in this regard.

9. Accordingly, the impugned order passed by the trial court in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.M.P.No.9030 of 2023 in C.C.No.295 of 2023 framing charge against the petitioners for the offence u/s 498A of IPC is set aside and consequently, the case in C.C.No.295 of 2023 is quashed. However, liberty is granted to the 2nd respondent to workout the remedy in the manner known to law with regard to maintenance for herself and the minor daughter.


10. In the result, the Criminal Revision Case is allowed. Consequently, the connected Criminal Miscellaneous Petitions are closed.

According to the defacto complainant, her husband and other accused, namely, her mother-in-law, father-in-law and brother-in-law abused her in filthy language and also threatened them with dire consequences.

5. In order to bring home the guilt of the accused, the prosecution examined P.W.1 to P.W.8 and marked Ex.P1 to Ex.P4. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

6. The evidence of Jayanthi (P.W.1) is that she married the first accused Sekar on 16.09.2004 and at the time of their marriage 10 sovereigns of gold jewels and a cash of Rs.50,000/- were given to the revision petitioner and that they were living happily for about six months. Thereafter, the revision petitioner who was working as a videographer in a shop, used to come home at about 01.00 am after consuming alcohol. According to her, he insisted her to watch pornography and tortured her sexually. Since she was unable to bear the torture, she left the matrimonial home with her son Sanjay. Thereafter, she along with her parents requested the parents of the first accused to return all the articles and cash of Rs.50,000/- which were presented at the time of marriage. It was further deposed by her that all the accused abused her and her parents and others who accompanied her, in filthy language and also threatened all of them with dire consequences.

7. Selvaraj (P.W.2) and Renuka (P.W.3) are the parents of Jayanthi (P.W.1) and Umashankar (P.W.4) is the brother of P.W.1. All of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis them corroborated the versions of P.W.1 in all material particulars.

8. Amudha (P.W.7) is related to P.W.1. she had deposed that P.W.1 had confided in her that she was tortured by the first accused/revision petitioner by insisting her to watch pornography every night. According to her, P.W.1 used to leave the matrimonial home on account of this and subsequently would be sent back after a temporary truce. On 24.08.2013, she had accompanied P.W.1 to P.W.4 to the house of the revision petitioner where they were also abused in filthy language by the revision petitioner his parents and his brother. According to her, they were also threatened with dire consequences.

9. When the accused including the present revision petitioner were questioned under Section 313 of Cr.P.C., with regard to the incriminating circumstances appearing in evidence against them they denied of having committed any offence. The revision petitioner examined himself as D.W.2 and one another witness as D.W.1 and marked Ex.D1 and Ex.D2.

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

10. Jayapal (D.W.1) – is the Manager of Indian Overseas Bank, Manachanallur Branch in which the accused is having a Savings Bank Account. The evidence of DW.1 is that a sum of Rs.93,000/- on 11.01.2012 and a sum of Rs.72,500/- on 08.02.2012 were transferred to the Account No.167801000001682 of one Jayapal from the account of the revision petitioner. He marked statement of accounts of D.W.2 (Ex.D1).


11. Sekar (D.W.2) is the first accused / revision petitioner. His evidence is that he did not receive any amount from the defacto complainant's parents towards dowry and further submitted that he lent a sum of Rs.93,000/- and Rs.72,500/- (totalling to Rs.1,65,000/-) to one Jayapal who is his wife's sister's husband. When he requested Jayapal and his wife Sushila to repay the said amount, his wife (P.W.1) was upset and left the matrimonial home. He had also deposed with regard to pendency of HMOP 84/2013 filed by him before the Subordinate Court, Ariyalur for restitution of conjugal rights against his wife. A copy of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis petition filed in HMOP 84/2013 was marked as Ex.D2. He also pointed out that his wife filed a petition in H.M.O.P.No.114/2017 before the Subordinate Court, Kumbakonam for divorce.


12. The learned Judicial Magistrate No.I, Ariyalur after analysing the oral and documentary evidence acquitted the accused 2 to 4 for the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 406, 506(i) of IPC. However, the present revision petitioner was convicted for the offence punishable under Sections 498A IPC and sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of six months and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for seven days. He was acquitted for the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 406, 506(i) IPC.


13. Aggrieved over the conviction and sentence passed by the trial court judge, the first accused / revision petitioner filed an appeal in Crl.A.No.09/2019 before the Principal District and Sessions Court, Ariyalur. The learned Principal District and Sessions Judge, Ariyalur https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis confirmed the conviction and sentence passed by the trial court judge, as against which, the present criminal revision case is filed.

14. Mr.S.Ambigapathi, learned counsel for the revision petitioner would contend that the wife of the revision petitioner during the pendency of the divorce petition married one Devendran and also gave birth to a child on 17.09.2022. His further contention is that the revision petitioner did not treat his wife cruelly as alleged by the defacto complainant and that since the first accused requested his wife's sister and her husband to repay the amount of Rs.1,65,000/- lent by him, the defacto complainant left the matrimonial home. It is also his contention that the accused had examined the Manager, Indian Overseas Bank, Manachanallur Branch in which the first accused had a savings bank account to show that he had lent a sum of Rs.1,65,000/- to his wife's sister's husband. According to the learned counsel, these aspects were not taken into account by both the Courts below while convicting the accused for the offence punishable under Section 498A IPC. It is also his contention that the divorce petition filed by his wife in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis H.M.O.P.No.114/2017 was allowed on 04.10.2023 by the learned Subordinate Judge, Kumbakonam and in these circumstances, he prayed for acquitting the accused.


15. Per contra, Mr.S.Raja Kumar, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor would contend that both the Courts below had, after analysing the oral/documentary evidence, rightly convicted and sentenced the accused and therefore, no interference is called for by this court and prayed for dismissal of the Criminal Revision Case.

16. At the outset, it may be observed that this Court while exercising jurisdiction under Section 397 Cr.P.C. cannot act as a second appellate court unless it is convinced that the conviction and sentence passed by both the Courts below are perverse.


17. In the instant case, both the Courts below had come to the conclusion that the revision petitioner / first accused had committed an offence punishable under Section 498A IPC. The specific allegation of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Jayanthi (P.W.1) is that her husband / revision petitioner used to come home late in the night after consuming alcohol, insisted her to watch pornography and tortured her sexually. She confided this to her maternal aunt Amudha (P.W.7). P.W.7 corroborated the versions of P.W.1. According to P.W.7, she used to pacify her. On 24.08.2013, P.W.1 to P.W.4 & P.W.7 had gone over to the house of the in-laws of the defacto complainant. Jayanthi (P.W.1) requested them to handover the jewels and cash received by them at the time of her marriage. Her deposition is that all the accused abused her and her parents and relatives in filthy language and also threatened them with dire consequences.

18. This incident that took place on 24.08.2013 was not accepted by both the Courts below. However, both the Courts below based on the evidence of P.W.1 had convicted the accused for the offence under Section 498A IPC. In fact, the appellate court, namely, the Principal District and Sessions Judge, Ariyalur vide his judgment dated 31.07.2020 had observed that P.W.1 had left her matrimonial home because she was unable to bear the torture at the hands of her husband, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the first accused / revision petitioner. In fact nothing useful was suggested to P.W.1 during the course of cross examination to discredit or disbelieve her versions.


19. Both the Courts below by their well reasoned orders had come to the conclusion that the accused had committed the offence punishable under Section 498A of Cr.P.C. The contention of the learned counsel for the revision petitioner / first accused is that the defacto complainant was upset over the demand made by the revision petitioner to her sister and her husband for the repayment of the money borrowed by them from the revision petitioner. Though transfer of a sum of Rs.1,65,000/- from the account of the revision petitioner to the account of Jayapal is proved, it is not known as to why the revision petitioner did not issue any legal notice to Jayapal, to repay the amount even after filing of the FIR against him by P.W.1. Mere transfer of a sum of Rs.1,65,000/- from the account of the accused to the account of Jayapal (brother-in-law of P.W.1), would not be a conclusive proof that Jayapal borrowed a sum of Rs.1,65,000/- from the revision petitioner. Moreover, no civil suit was https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis filed against Jayapal for recovery of money till date.

20. All the observations made by both the Courts below are perfectly in order and therefore, I do not find any reason to interfere with the same. Hence, the conviction passed by both the Courts below against the revision petitioner/ first accused for the offence punishable under Section 498A IPC is hereby confirmed.


21. As regards the sentence, it is seen from the records that the complaint was lodged in the year 2013 and the accused had already undergone the ordeal of trial. In these circumstances, the sentence passed by the trial court judge is modified as under ""simple imprisonment for a period of two months and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for seven days"".


22. In the result, i. This Criminal Revision Case is partly allowed. ii. The conviction under Section 498(A) IPC is confirmed. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis iii. The sentence is modified as ""simple imprisonment for a period of two months and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for seven days"". The period of sentence already undergone by him is set off under Section 428 Cr.P.C. iv. The revision petitioner/ first accused shall surrender before the Judicial Magistrate No.I, Ariyalur, within 15 days from the date of receipt of copy of this order / uploading of the order, failing which, the Trial Court shall take steps to secure his presence for serving the remaining period of sentence.

""15. An offence is punishable under Section 498A of the IPC when a husband or his relative subjects a woman to cruelty, which may result in imprisonment for a term extending up to three years and a fine. The Explanation under Section 498A of the IPC defines ""cruelty"" for the purpose of Section 498A of the IPC to mean any of the acts mentioned in clauses (a) or (b). The first limb of clause (a) of the Explanation of Section 498A of the IPC, states that ""cruelty"" means any wilful conduct that is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide. The second limb of clause (a) of the Explanation of Section 498A of the IPC, states that cruelty means any wilful conduct that is of such a nature as to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman. Further, clause (b) of the Explanation of Section 498A of the IPC states that cruelty would also include harassment of the woman where such harassment is to coerce her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.
16. Further, Section 3 of the Dowry Act deals with penalty for giving or taking dowry. It states that any person who engages in giving, taking, or abetting the exchange of dowry, shall face a punishment of imprisonment for a minimum of five years and a fine of not less than fifteen thousand rupees or the value of the dowry, whichever is greater. Section 4 of the Dowry Act talks of penalty for demanding dowry. It states that any person demanding dowry directly or Page 4 indirectly, from the parents or other relatives or guardians of a bride or bridegroom shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months, but which may extend to two years and with fine which may extend to ten thousand rupees.
18. A bare perusal of the FIR shows that the allegations made by respondent No.2 are vague and omnibus. Other than claiming that appellant No.1 harassed her and that appellant Nos.2 to 6 instigated him to do so, respondent No.2 has not provided any specific details or described any particular instance of harassment. She has also not mentioned the time, date, place, or manner in which the alleged harassment occurred. Therefore, the FIR lacks concrete and precise allegations.
25. A mere reference to the names of family members in a criminal case arising out of a matrimonial dispute, without specific allegations indicating their active involvement should be nipped in the bud. It is a well- recognised fact, borne out of judicial experience, that there is often a tendency to implicate all the members of the husband's family when domestic disputes arise out of a matrimonial discord. Such generalised and sweeping accusations unsupported by concrete evidence or particularised allegations cannot form the basis for criminal prosecution. Courts must exercise caution in such cases to prevent misuse of legal provisions and the legal process and avoid unnecessary harassment of innocent family members. In the present case, appellant Nos.2 to 6, who are the members of the family of appellant No.1 have been living in different cities and have not resided in the matrimonial house of appellant No.1 and respondent No.2 herein. Hence, they cannot be dragged into criminal prosecution and the same would be an abuse of the process of the law in the absence of specific allegations made against each of them.
28. The inclusion of Section 498A of the IPC by way of an amendment was intended to curb cruelty inflicted on a woman by her husband and his family, ensuring swift intervention by the State. However, in recent years, as there have been a notable rise in matrimonial Page 5 disputes across the country, accompanied by growing discord and tension within the institution of marriage, consequently, there has been a growing tendency to misuse provisions like Section 498A of the IPC as a tool for unleashing personal vendetta against the husband and his family by a wife. Making vague and generalised allegations during matrimonial conflicts, if not scrutinized, will lead to the misuse of legal processes and an encouragement for use of arm twisting tactics by a wife and/or her family. Sometimes, recourse is taken to invoke Section 498A of the IPC against the husband and his family in order to seek compliance with the unreasonable demands of a wife. Consequently, this Court has, time and again, cautioned against prosecuting the husband and his family in the absence of a clear prima facie case against them.
29. We are not, for a moment, stating that any woman who has suffered cruelty in terms of what has been contemplated under Section 498A of the IPC should remain silent and forbear herself from making a complaint or initiating any criminal proceeding. That is not the intention of our aforesaid observations but we should not encourage a case like as in the present one, where as a counterblast to the petition for dissolution of marriage sought by the first appellant-husband of the second respondent herein, a complaint under Section 498A of the IPC is lodged by the latter. In fact, the insertion of the said provision is meant mainly for the protection of a woman who is subjected to cruelty in the matrimonial home primarily due to an unlawful demand for any property or valuable security in the form of dowry. However, sometimes it is misused as in the present case.
30. In the above context, this Court in G.V. Rao vs. L.H.V. Prasad, (2000) 3 SCC 693 observed as follows:
""12. There has been an outburst of matrimonial disputes in recent times. Marriage is a sacred ceremony, the main purpose of which is to enable the young couple to settle down in life and live peacefully. But little matrimonial skirmishes suddenly erupt which often assume serious proportions resulting in Page 6 commission of heinous crimes in which elders of the family are also involved with the result that those who could have counselled and brought about rapprochement are rendered helpless on their being arrayed as accused in the criminal case. There are many other reasons which need not be mentioned here for not encouraging matrimonial litigation so that the parties may ponder over their defaults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of fighting it out in a court of law where it takes years and years to conclude and in that process the parties lose their ""young"" days in chasing their ""cases"" in different courts.""
31. Further, this Court in Preeti Gupta vs. State of Jharkhand (2010) 7 SCC 667 held that the courts have to be extremely careful and cautious in dealing with these complaints and must take pragmatic realties into consideration while dealing with matrimonial cases. The allegations of harassment by the husband's close relatives who had been living in different cities and never visited or rarely visited the place where the complainant resided would have an entirely different complexion. The allegations of the complainant are required to be scrutinized with great care and circumspection.

32. We, therefore, are of the opinion that the impugned FIR No.82 of 2022 filed by respondent No.2 was initiated with ulterior motives to settle personal scores and grudges against appellant No.1 and his family members i.e., appellant Nos.2 to 6 herein. Hence, the present case at hand falls within category (7) of illustrative parameters highlighted in Bhajan Lal. Therefore, the High Court, in the present case, erred in not exercising the powers available to it under Section 482 CrPC and thereby failed to prevent abuse of the Court's process by continuing the criminal prosecution against the appellants.""

8. In the present case, the materials on record including the case diary do not prima facie make out a case for the offences alleged against the petitioners herein.

                                                           ORDER
This Criminal Original Petition has been filed to call for the records in C.C.No.3686 of 2021 on the file of the XVIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai and quash the same.


2. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner is the husband of the 2nd respondent. He is an accused in C.C.No.3686 of 2021 on the file of XVIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai. In pursuance of a complaint given by the 2nd respondent, a case has been registered by the first respondent police for the offence punishable under sections 498-A, 324, and 506(ii) IPC and Section 4 of TNPHW Act in Cr.No.7 of 2021. After investigation, the first respondent police filed final report in C.C.No.3686 of 2021 before the XVIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet.

3. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that before the trial court, the petitioner filed an application in Crl.M.P.No.17389 of 2022 in C.C.No.3686 of 2021 to discharge him from the criminal proceedings in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.C.No.3686 of 2021, wherein, by order dated 28.4.2023, the learned trial judge discharged the petitioner/husband from the offences under sections 324 and 506(ii) IPC and u/s. 4 of TNPHW Act, but he took cognisance against the petitioner for the offence under section 498 A IPC. The ingredients constituting the offence under section 498A is not attracted in the materials produced by the prosecution. Further, there is no material and statement available on record to show the wilful conduct and cruelty committed on the part of the petitioner/ husband upon his wife. In the circumstances, in the absence of commission of any cruelty by the husband upon his wife, the offence under section 498A of IPC will not be attracted.


4. In support of his contentions, he relied upon the judgments of the Supreme Court reported in the following cases;

1. (2008) 15 Supreme Court Cases 582 (State of Andhra Pradesh vs. M. Madhusudhan Rao.

2. (2009) 10 Supreme Court Cases 604 (Bhaskar Lal Sharma and another Vs. Monica)

3. (2022) 6 Supreme Court Cases 599 (Kahkashan Kausar Alias Sonam and others Vs. State of Bihar and others) He further submitted that in the absence of any ingredients, to meet out the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis offence constituting under section 498 A IPC, it will be a mere misuse of provisions of Section 498A IPC and abuse of process of law, if the proceeding is allowed to continue. Hence by invoking 482 of Cr.P.C., the petitioner seeks to quash the criminal proceedings initiated against him in C.C.No.3686 of 2021.

5. The learned Govt. Advocate (crl.side) appearing for the respondent police submitted that in this case, the trial was commenced and so far, witnesses LW1 and LW3 were examined as PW1 and PW2 andthe case is posted for further examination of witnesses on 21.07.2023.

6. The learned counsel appearing for the 2nd respondent/defacto complainant submitted that the 2nd respondent wife is 80% partially disabled person. The petitioner/husband treated the 2nd respondent/wife cruelly and changed the places where the objects were kept in the house, thus caused hindrance to his wife, who is having partial blindness. He also poured oil on the floor of the kitchen which lead to injuries sustained on her leg. The revision petitioner has also made firing electric circuits that has given her shock and he also threw glass cups against his wife and children and thereby she sustained injuries. These acts amounts to clear activities of cruelty. Further whether it https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis has been done unintentionally or not, has to be decided after letting in evidence before the trial court. In the circumstances, it is inappropriate to quash the criminal proceedings initiated against him.


7. He further submitted that now witnesses PW1 and 2 have been examined and it has to be decided by the trial court and it has to be left to the trial Judge to appreciate the evidence and hence the prosecution cannot be quashed at this stage . Hence, he seeks to dismiss this criminal original petition.

8. Considered the arguments of both sides and perused the materials available on record.


9. On perusal of facts and materials, the fact reveals that the petitioner is an accused in C.C.No.3686 of 2021 on the file of XVIII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai. In pursuance of the complaint given by the informant/wife, a case has been registered by the 1st respondent police in C.C.No.7 of 2020 for the offences under sections 498-A, 324, 506(11) IPC along with section 4 of TNPWH Act. After investigation, final report was filed. The records would further reveal that the petitioner/accused had filed a petition before the trial court https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis in CMP.No.17398 of 2023 to discharge him from the criminal proceedings. The learned Judge, after considering the rival submissions, found that there is no allegation in support of the charge for the offence under section 324, 506(ii) IPC besides section 4 of TNPHW Act, but found primafacie material to proceed against the accused under section 498A IPC and thereby partly allowed the petition and took cognizance against the petitioner/accused under section 498A IPC. In the impugned order, the learned trial Judge, for his satisfaction, recorded as follows;

'It has been carefully referred by this court. In the case in hand, the sons of the accused, they had elaborately given their statement before the investigation officer substantiating the complainant's statement and the complaint. On plain reading of the statement adduced before the investigation officer itself would reveal that there is a prima facie case is made out as against the accused. It has to be testified through the testimony of the evidence before the court of law. In the pre-trial stage, this court would not be come to the conclusion.

10. On perusal of the statement of the victim and other witnesses, the trial court satisfied to proceed further. Further with regard to decision relied on by the petitioner in (2008) 15 Supreme Court Cases 582 (State of Andhra Pradesh vs. M. Madhusudhan Rao, it is an appeal against conviction. After letting in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis evidence, the Court searched whether there is a sufficient evidence to convict the accused for the offence under section 498A IPC, but in this case, no evidence is analysed by the trial Court. Further, in other two decisions mentioned supra, the court quashed the proceedings in the absence of any allegation made or found primafacie case to proceed with the case. But in the instant case, the evidence has to be recorded. Further, the trial court also satisfied to proceed further. During the course of trial, witnesses LW1 and LW3 were examined as PW1 and PW2 .


11. Further, in this case, prima facie, there is allegation against the husband with regard to cruelty and it has to be adjudicated by appreciation of evidence, after letting in evidence as to whether the husband intentionally done all the activities stated by the petitioner/wife or not.

(i) State of Haryana and others Vs. Bhajanlal reported in AIR 1992 (604)
(ii) R.P.Kapoor Vs. State of Punjab reported in AIR 1960 SC 866;
(iii)Neeharica Infrastructure Pvt. Limited Vs. State of Maharashtra and others reported in AIR 2021 SC 1918;
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis The Honourable Supreme Court in the above cases, settled the principle that in exercising its jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C., the High Court would not embark upon an enquiry as to whether the evidence in question is reliable or not, that is the function of the trial Magistrate and ordinarily it would not be open to any party to invoke the High Court's inherent jurisdiction and content that on a reasonable appreciation of the evidence, the accusation made against the accused would be sustained.


12. This case does not meet the parameters laid down by the decisions stated above by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. In view of the above, this court is of the view that it is inappropriate to quash the proceedings at this stage. I find no merits in this petition. Hence this Criminal Original Petition is dismissed. Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.

Vaidegi vs Pradeep S,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/58833227/,"Bangalore District Court
Vaidegi vs Pradeep S on 8 January, 2025
The P.S.I., of K.R.Puram Police Station, Bengaluru, has filed the present charge sheet against the accused for the offence punishable under sections 498A, 504, 506 of IPC and Secs.3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act

2. BRIEF FACTS OF THE PROSECUTION CASE ARE AS UNDER :

It is the case of the complainant that, her marriage was solemnized with the accused on 22.11.2015 at Priya Mahal, Ambur as per the Hindu Customs and Rituals. It is further alleged that, thereafter, the accused looked after the CW.1 cordially for some time. It is further alleged that, thereafter, the accused and the complainant were shifted to Bangalore and C.CNo.54782/2018 were residing at No.19, 1st Cross, Sai Ram Layout, T.C.Palya, at that time, as the accused was not satisfied with the Dowry given to him at the time of marriage, demanded additional dowry of cash of Rs.1,00,000/- and subjected the complainant to cruelty both by physically and mentally and also threatened CW.1 with dire consequences, if she did not bring the said amount from her parental house. It is also alleged that, the accused has abused CW.1 in filthy language. Based on the typed complaint lodged by C.W.1, case was registered against accused nos. 1 to 3 in P.S. Crime No.624/16 for the offence punishable under sections 498(a) of IPC and Section 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. Investigating Officers after completion of the investigation has submitted final report against the present accused for the offence punishable U/s 498(A), 504, 506 of IPC and Secs.3 & 4 of D.P.Act. I.O has left out accused nos. 2 and 3.
3. During the crime stage, the accused in the present case along with accused No.2 and 3 have obtained anticipatory bail from the Hon'ble CCH-51 and were released on bail. Upon receipt of charge sheet, cognizance was taken for the offence punishable U/sections 498(a) of IPC and Section 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, against the accused No.1 C.CNo.54782/2018 and registered the criminal case against him. The I.O has left out the accused No.2 and 3 in the charge sheet.

4. After registering the case, the accused No.1 has appeared. Copy of the final report and it's enclosures were furnished to him in compliance of section 207 of Cr.P.C. Sufficient grounds were made out to frame charges. Hence, charges framed and read over to the accused No.1. He pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

5. In order to prove the guilt of the accused No.1, the prosecution has examined the complainant/CW.1 as PW.1 and the Independent witness/CW.4 as PW.2 out of 11 witnesses cited in the charge sheet and relied upon documents as per Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.7 and closed its side. In lieu of absence of incriminating circumstances appearing against accused No.1, recording of his examination as provided under section 313 of Cr.P.C. was dispensed with.

6. Heard the arguments of both parties. Perused the materials on record.

7. The points that arise for my consideration are;

C.CNo.54782/2018

1. Whether the prosecution proves beyond all reasonable doubt that the accused No.1 was married with her on 22.11.2015 at Priya Mahal, Ambur and the accused looked after the CW.1 cordially for some time, thereafter, the accused and the complainant were shifted to Bangalore at that time, the accused No.1 demanded for dowry and subjected the complainant to cruelty both by physically and mentally and thereby committed an offence punishable U/s.498A of IPC ?

2. Whether the prosecution proves beyond all reasonable doubt that, the accused No.1 was not satisfied with the Dowry given to him at the time of marriage, demanded additional dowry of cash of Rs.1,00,000/- and the accused No.1 used to harass the complainant both physically and mentally and thereby committed an offence punishable U/s.3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act ?

3. Whether the prosecution proves beyond all reasonable doubt that, accused No.1 threatened C.CNo.54782/2018 CW.1 with dire consequences, if she did not bring the said amount from her parental house and thereby committed an offence punishable U/s.506 of IPC ?

4. Whether the prosecution proves beyond all reasonable doubt that, accused No.1 abused CW.1 in filthy language, if she did not bring the said amount from her parental house and thereby committed an offence punishable U/s.504 of IPC ?

5. What Order?

8. My findings on the above points are as under:

Point Nos.1 to 4 : In the Negative.
              Point No.5             : As per the final order
                                       for the following;

                               REASONS

      9.      POINT Nos.1 to 4 :-

As these four points are interlinked, I have taken up these points together for common discussion to avoid repetition of facts & evidence.
C.CNo.54782/2018 In order to bring home the guilt of the accused No.1, the prosecution has examined the complainant/victim/C.W.1 as P.W.1 and also examined the father of the complainant CW.4 as PW.2 and relied upon Seven documents.
10. In order to bring home the guilt of the accused No.1, the prosecution has examined the complainant / victim CW.1 as PW.1, the father of the complainant CW.4 as PW.2, wherein, they have not supported the case of the prosecution. The learned APP appearing for the State with permission treated the said witnesses as hostile and fully cross examined them. Nothing was elicited from the mouth of the PW.1 and 2 in order to prove the guilt of the accused No.1.
11. On perusal of the materials on record and the oral & documentary evidence of P.W.1, she has categorically admitted that, she has compromised the matter with the accused No.1. In view of the evidence of P.W.1 and 2, since the matter was compromised, the prayer of the learned Asst. Public Prosecutor for issuance of witness summons to other witnesses was rejected as no purpose would be served. As the P.W.1 and 2 have turned hostile to the case of the prosecution, the evidence on record is not at all helpful to substantiate the guilt of the accused No.1.
Hence, there is no cogent and convincing evidence against the accused No.1. Accordingly, the benefit of doubt has to be C.CNo.54782/2018 extended to the accused No.1 and hence, the Point Nos.1 to 4 are answered in the ""Negative"".

12. Point No.5 :- In view of the findings on above points, I proceed to pass the following;

ORDER Acting under section 248(1) of Cr.P.C. the accused No.1 is acquitted of the offence punishable under sections 498A, 504, 506 of Indian Penal Code and Secs.3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act.

The bail bond and surety bond of the accused No.1 shall be in force for the period of 6 months and thereafter it shall be cancelled without further orders.

                                            COMMON JUDGMENT

This Criminal Appeal has been filed against the judgment of conviction and sentence imposed on the appellant/accused in Session Case No.248 of 2015, dated 29.11.2018, on the file of learned IV Additional District Judge/Sessions Judge, Mahalir Neethi Mandram (Mahila Court), Coimbatore.


2. The Criminal Revision Petition has been filed by the petitioner for setting aside the order of the trial Court and consequently, to direct the respondent for return of passport.


3. The case of the prosecution as put forth before the Trial Court is that on 31.01.2015 between 5.00 and 6.45 pm, the deceased Sangeetha https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis committed suicide by hanging using her saree in her parental house. The husband of the deceased is A1; A2 and A3 are father and sister of A1 and A4 is brother of A1 and the Juvenile accused Jeyanthraj is the youngest brother of A1. At the time of marriage between the A1 and the deceased Sangeetha, her parents gave Rs.3 lakhs and 20 sovereign of gold jewels to her and also gave 1 sovereign of chain with 3 gm., dolar, ½ sovereign of ring, 3 gm of kanganam and 2 kg of silver to A1 as Dowry. A1 was working at Muscat as Engineer and the deceased was living with her in-laws as joint family at Coimbatore. A1 often asked the deceased to bring money from her parental house and all the accused persons were always talking about the dowry and harassed the deceased Sangeetha. While the parents of deceased Sangeetha asked A1 to take their daughter with him to Muscat, A2 and A3 scolded her parents stating that if they were in a hurry, they should get a visa for her daughter and buy necessary things for house give Rs.30,000/- for rent and send their daughter to Muscat. A4 also scolded the deceased Sangeetha by pointing out the dark complexion and she does not match his brother; that his brother was magnanimous in marrying her and then his parents would not give the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis money they asked for and the Juvenile accused Jayantharaj scolded and intimidated the deceased Sangeetha and the sangeetha when informed about the torture of A2 to A4 and Juvenile accused Jayantharaj to her husband's phone that they treated her as a servant maid. A1 replied that he married her only for house hold work and and advised Sangeetha to adjust with his parents and brothers and that he would act according to their wishes. When deceased Sangeetha visited her parental house to see her father who was ill with the permission of her in-laws, A1 scolded her over phone stating that disobey his parents since she is disobeying his parents and going to her parental house, she should stay there itself and that he would not talk to her anymore and this caused mental agony to the deceased Sangeetha and A2 vigorously scolded the relations of the deceased Sangeetha, who questioned to them. Hence, the deceased Sangeetha during her stay in her parental house at Door No.111, Sullivan Street, Gandhipark, Coimbatore, committed suicide by hanging herself using her Saree on 31.01.2015 between 5.00 and 6.45 pm and died. Therefore, A1 to A4 have committed an offence punishable under Section 498A and 304B of IPC. The Assistant Commissioner of Police, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Coimbatore City has filed a charge sheet against A1 to A4 and the Juvenile Accused before the Judicial Magistrate No.V, Coimbatore.

4. The committal Magistrate, after completing the procedures under Section 207 Cr.P.C., committed the case to the Principal Session Court, Coimbatore, as the offences were triable exclusively by the Court of Session. The Principal Session Judge, Coimbatore took the case on file as Session Case No.248 of 2015, and framed charges under Section 498A and 304B IPC against the appellant/A1 and against A2 to A4 who are parents and brother of A1.


5. In order to prove the prosecution case, 18 witnesses were examined as PW1 to PW18 and 21 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to P21 and M.Os., 1 to 13 were also marked. After examining the prosecution witnesses, the incriminating circumstances culled out from the evidence of the prosecution witnesses were put before the accused and questioned under Section 313 Cr.P.C., they denied all the incriminating circumstances as false and pleaded not guilty. On the side https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis of the defence, A1 was examined as DW-1 and Exs.D.1 to Exs.D14 were marked through him.


6. After considering the evidence on either side and the documents exhibited on both sides, the learned Trial Judge came to the conclusion that A1 is guilty for the offence under Section 498A IPC., and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/-, in default of payment of fine, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months. The learned Trial Judge however acquitted the A1 for the offence under Section 304(B), and A2 to A4 were also acquitted of the offences punishable under Section 498(A) and 304(B) IPC and 235(1) Cr.PC. Aggrieved over the judgment, the present appeal has been preferred by the appellant/A1.


7. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant contended that the appellant and his wife Sangeetha got married on 02.11.2014. They lived happily after the wedding. The appellant was employed in Muscat and he asked his wife Sangeetha to arrange for passport and visa to join https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis him at Muscat. The deceased Sangeetha used to visit her parents house quite often. After 18.01.2015, when the deceased Sangeetha went her parents house to see her ailing father there was a drastic change in her behaviour and the appellant did not have any clue about her changed behaviour. She avoided his phone calls on some reason or the other and on 31.01.2015, the appellant/A1 received a message stating that his wife committed suicide by hanging at the house of her parents and therefore, he rushed back to India. The learned counsel further contended that P.W.1 to PW7 are interested witnesses and the judgment of the Trial Court based on the interested witnesses is erroneous. The Trial Court failed to appreciate the evidence of PW-13 that the Appellant/A1 and the deceased were talking to each other till her death and hence the allegation that the appellant/A1 caused mental agony to the deceased is false. The evidence of PW-13, is also substantiated by the evidence of PW-1 to PW-3, the parents and sister of the deceased who have categorically deposed that the appellant was talking over phone till her death. Hence, the Trial Court has wrongly come to a conclusion that the alleged act of not calling the deceased Sangeetha over phone amounted https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis to cruelty as defined under Section 498-A explanation (a) of IPC. The learned counsel also contended that the ingredients of Section 498-A IPC is not attracted to the case on hand and hence, prayed to set aside the judgment of conviction and sentence.


8. On the other hand, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that the Trial Court has on appreciation of the cogent evidence of the prosecution witnesses came to the conclusion that the appellant/A1 has subjected his wife to cruelty and hence, the judgment of conviction and sentence imposed on the appellant should be confirmed.

9. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and perused the materials placed on record.


10. Admittedly, the marriage between the appellant and the deceased was solemnized on 02.11.2014 and the said marriage was arranged by the elders of both the family and the expenditure for the marriage was incurred by the appellant/A1, but however, some amount https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis was also given by the parents of the deceased towards marriage expenses. At the time of marriage, the appellant was working as an Engineer in Muscat. After the marriage, he left for Muscat and it is also admitted that the victim Sangeetha died on 31.01.3015, which is within 3 months from the date of marriage 02.11.2014. It is also admitted that she committed suicide by hanging herself. The parents of the deceased filed a complaint and the investigation revealed that her death cannot be called to be under normal circumstances. Though a case was initially filed under Section 173 Cr.P.C., subsequently, the case was altered into under Sections 304(B) and 498A IPC. Out of 18 witnesses, PW-1 is the mother of the victim; PW-2 is the father of the victim, PW-3 is the sister of the victim and PWs-1 to 3 have clearly stated that the appellant and the other accused demanded dowry, but however, the Trial Court acquitted all the accused for the offence under Section 304(B) and except appellant the Trial Court also acquitted the other accused for the offence under Section 498A. Neither the prosecution nor the victim side has preferred appeal against the acquittal of the accused, however, the appellant/A1 has filed the present Appeal against the judgment of conviction for the offence https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis under Section 498A IPC. Since this Court is an Appellate Court and also a final Court of fact finding, it has to re-appreciate the entire evidence and come to the conclusion independently.


11. Though the learned counsel appearing for the appellant has contended that the witnesses are interested, it is quite natural to have interested witnesses in a case where matrimonial disputes are involved. The evidence of the witnesses is cogent and trustworthy and the Trial Court on appreciation of the evidence and the other materials available on record, has rightly come to the conclusion that the appellant/A1 has subjected his wife to cruelty.


12. The only point that has to be considered in this appeal is that as to whether the conviction and sentence imposed on the appellant by the trial Court under Section 498(A) is correct or not? since the trial Court has acquitted A1 and other accused of all the other offences.

13. It is the case of the prosecution as put forth from the evidence of PWs 1 to 3 that the deceased got the permission of A2 and went to her https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis parental house and A1 expressed his anguish that the deceased has gone to her place of parents' inspite of the instructions of A2 & A3 and hence he would not speak to her till she comes back to the matrimonial home and this has caused mental agony to the deceased. It is also evident that the deceased was sad and crying because appellant/A1 did not speak to her. The witnesses PWs 1 to 4, 6 & 7 have also spoken about the deceased state of mind because of her husband not speaking to her.

14. On a combined reading of the evidence of PWs – 1 to 3 and also the evidence of Doctors PWs 14 & 15, who conducted the postmortem would clearly state that death of the deceased was not a normal circumstances/unnatural.


15. Furthermore, after the death of the deceased, the same was informed to appellant/A1, who was on the way to India and he did not come and attend the funeral/last rites of the deceased, even parents of the appellant/A1 also did not attend the funeral of the deceased. Though the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that there was a threat, but https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis however, as a husband he ought to have taken part in the funeral ceremonies and also should have been given all this customary rites to the departed soul of the deceased. But in this case admittedly, neither the Appellant/A1 nor his parents attended the funeral of the deceased, which also strength the case of the prosecution.

16. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant contended that Appellant/A1 examined as DW-1 has categorically stated that he contacted his wife through phone of PW-2 and he was informed that the phone of the deceased wife was under repair and that she would talk to him after it is repaired. Further the learned counsel contended that the evidence of PW-13, RDO is also to the effect that the appellant had been talking to the deceased till her death. The prosecution failed to prove that the appellant/A1 did not speak to the deceased over phone, which caused mental agony to the deceased. The alleged act of not calling over phone does not amount to 'cruelty' as defined under Section 498A IPC.

17. The Trial Court, after considering this contention of the learned counsel appearing for the appellant, has rightly concluded that whatsapp chat/Ex.D-13, proves that there was no conversation between https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis appellant/A1 and the deceased after 14.01.2015 and there was no initiation on the side of the appellant for talking with the deceased. If he had spoken to the deceased through her father, he would have produced the CDR containing the chat or conversation with the deceased. In the absence of whatsapp chat or call list would show that the appellant was not talking to the deceased as she went to her parents' place without getting permission from A1 to A3 and that has caused severe mental agony to the deceased. In this regard, this Court extracts the provision under Section 498A IPC as follows:-

Section 498A - “Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty:-
Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman subjects such woman to cruelty, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.
Explanation:- For the purposes of this section, Cruelty means:-
(a) any wilfull conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or
(b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis demand”
18. On consideration of the oral evidence of the prosecution witnesses and the documentary evidence in particular Ex.D-13, I am of the view that the appellant/A1 remained silent and did not talk to his wife after 14.01.2015 and that had caused severe mental agony to the deceased and this act of the appellant comes within the purview of “Cruelty” defined under Section 498A, Explanation (a) of IPC. It is also to be taken into account that the deceased was not happy in her matrimonial life and was disturbed by her in-laws.

19. In view of the discussion made above, the Trial Court has rightly come to the conclusion that the Appellant/A1 was guilt of offence punishable under Section 498A IPC and the sentence imposed on the appellant under Section 498A to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/-, in default of payment of fine, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months have to be confirmed and accordingly confirmed. Hence, the trial Court is directed to take appropriate steps to secure the appellant to undergo his remaining period https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis of sentence. The appellant is entitled to avail set off under Section 428 of Cr.P.C for the period of custody already undergone by them during investigation, enquiry and trial.


20. In the result, the Criminal Appeal is dismissed.

21. In view of the dismissal of the Criminal Appeal in Crl. A.No.831 of 2018, the Crl.R.C.No.1351 of 2019 which has been filed by the appellant/A1 for return of his passport has also to be dismissed and accordingly, dismissed.

                                                         JUDGMENT
On 27.04.2008, on receipt of the memo from KMC Hospital, the Sub Inspector of Police attached to P2 Otteri Police Station went to KMC Hospital, Chennai, recorded the statement of one Sagana Devi, aged 20 years admitted, wife of Karthikeyan, admitted in the Burn Ward and registered case in Crime No.191 of 2008 for offence under Section 309 of IPC.


2. According to the statement of Sagana Devi leading to registration of the First Information Report, she and her husband along with 6 months old son Sakthivel presently residing at D.No.43, Ponniamman Koil Street, Purasaivakkam, Chennai. Their marriage took place 1 ½ years ago. At the time of marriage, her parents gave 15 sovereign of jewels to her as strithana and 3 sovereign of jewels to her husband. The marriage expenses were met out by her family. After marriage, they were living with her mother-in-law https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis at Sachithanantham Street. At that time, her mother-in-law used to demand fridge and washing machine from her parents and pick up quarrel. 15 days prior to the incident, they set up separate residence at Ponniamman Koil Street. On 27.04.2008, her husband came home with salary and told, out of his salary, Rs.3000/- to be given to his mother. The deceased Sagana Devi refused, since she has to meet out the house rent and brokerage. There was wordy quarrel between husband and wife in this connection. Due to the mental torture, she doused herself with kerosene and set fire. Her husband, hearing her scream, put out the fire and took her to KMC Hospital for treatment. After registration of the case, the Sub Inspector of Police gave a request to the Metropolitan Magistrate for recording her statement.

3.Accordingly, the Metropolitan Magistrate, after ensuring that she is in fit state of mind to give statement, recorded her statement. The deceased Sagana Devi succumbed to injury on the next day at 07.15 a.m. Receiving said information, charge was altered and alteration report was forwarded to the Court. RDO enquiry was arranged since the death was within 7 years of her marriage. After completion of investigation, final report filed. The https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Mahila Court, on committal, framed charges against A1 to A4, who are husband, mother-in-law, father-in-law and sister-in-law of the deceased Sagana Devi for the offence under (i) Sections 498A and (ii) 304((B) in alteration Section 306 IPC.


4.The prosecution to prove the charges, examined 14 witnesses, marked 20 exhibits and 2 material objects. In defence, 4 witnesses were examined and one exhibit was marked.


5.The trial Court on appreciation of evidence, acquitted the accused from the charge under Section 304(B) of IPC in alteration Section 306 of IPC. Convicted the accused A1 to A4 for the offence under Section 498A and sentenced each of them to undergo three years RI and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/-, in default to undergo, three months SI.

6. Plea of the appellants:-

The learned counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that the trial Court having found no material to convict the accused under Section https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 304(B) @ 306 IPC ought to have acquitted them for offence under Section 498A of IPC since the ingredient and necessary material for proof of these two offences are one and the same. The learned counsel appearing for the appellants also contended that PW-1, PW-2 and PW-3 are closely related to the deceased by blood. They are interested witnesses and their allegation regarding demand of dowry on the earlier occasion are highly doubtful, in the absence of any documentary or corroboratory evidence. The evidence of PW-4 (Kousalya), who is the owner of the house, in which the deceased and her husband (A-1) along with her son were residing in a portion of her house had deposed that on the date of occurrence seeing smoke from that portion, she went there and found the deceased under fire and her husband was sleeping. She woke up her husband Karthikeyan(A1) and he set out the fire and laid his wife on sofa. When she has positively deposed that there was no quarrel between the husband and wife, the case of the prosecution is disproved by the evidence of PW-4, who is an independent witness, having no personal interest in the out come of the case. Hence, the trial Court ought to have acquitted the accused of charge under 498A IPC. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
7.Three statements regarding the cause of suicide recorded. The statement found in Accident Register (Ex.P7), statement found in the dying declaration (Ex.P9) and the statement given to the Sub Inspector of Police are inconsistent to each other and therefore, none of them are reliable. However, the trial Court had ignored the inconsistency and convicted the accused 1 to 4.


8.Even according to the prosecution, 15 days prior to the occurrence, the deceased and her husband along with their son had gone separately and established a separate house. A2 to A4 were not residing with them at the time of occurrence. Further, there is evidence to show that on the date of occurrence, the family members of the deceased PW-1 and PW-3 came to the house of the deceased and they had demanded necklace from the deceased. While so, when the cause for committing suicide is entirely different, the trial Court, without considering the deposition of the defence witnesses, has erroneously convicted them for the offence under Section 498A of IPC.

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

9.Plea of the State/Respondent:-

The learned Government Advocate (Crl.Side) per contra submitted that the necessary ingredient to punish the accused for offence under Section 498A of IPC is subjecting woman to cruelty by husband or relative of husband which likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical). The prosecution has established the required ingredient through the statement of the deceased as well as from the depositions of PW-1 to PW-3 and PW-5.
10. Regarding the alleged contradiction in the previous statement of the deceased, the learned Government Advocate (Crl.Side) submitted that in the First Information Report, the deceased has informed the Sub Inspector of Police (PW-12) that her mother-in-law daily used to pick up quarrel with her daily demanding fridge and washing machine as dowry from her parents and on the date of occurrence, there was dispute between the deceased and her husband (A1) regarding sharing the salary with A1's mother. The Accident Register, which is marked as Ex.P7, the Doctor has recorded that https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the injured alleged, she was harassed by her mother-in-law, father-in-law and sister-in-law. Due to that, she has set herself under fire.

11.To the Judicial Magistrate (PW-9), the deceased Sagana Devi has stated that her husband gave Rs.3000/- from his salary to his mother and with the remaining Rs.2,000/- she was unable to pay the house rent and meet out the family expenses. Therefore, on 27.04.2008 at about 04.00 p.m, there was quarrel between her and her husband. Due to that, she set fire on herself dousing kerosene.


12. The learned Government Advocate (Crl.Side) submitted that there is no inconsistency in these statements. The cruelty caused is expressed in three different ways. He also submitted that under Section 32 of the Indian Evidence Act, statement of the death person becomes relevant and admissible, if it relates to the cause of death, when the cause of that person death comes into question. Therefore, the deceased statements given to the police and Doctor has to be read harmoniously.

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

13. In this case, on 27.04.2008 at about 04.00 p.m., the deceased has set fire to herself dousing kerosene. She died on the next day at 07.15 a.m. due to the burn injury sustained. In her statement as found in the Accident Register (Ex.P7), her oral complaint duly reduced into writing as (Ex.P14) and dying declaration (Ex.P5) which were recorded on 27.04.2008 at 06.15 p.m, 07.30 p.m and 09.30 p.m respectively, she has disclosed the reason for committing suicide and the fight, which took place between the deceased and her husband on the date of occurrence. Therefore, the learned Government Advocate (Crl.Side) submitted that having proved that the deceased was subjected to cruelty by her husband and in-laws of the deceased, who are arrayed as A1 to A4, the finding of the Court below has to be confirmed.


14. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the appellant and the learned Government Advocate (Crl.Side) appearing for State.

15. In the instant case, the criminal law has been set into motion, based on the oral statement of the deceased Sagana Devi, which was https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis reduced into writing and marked as Ex.P14. In that complaint, she has stated about the demand of fridge and washing machine by her mother-in- law on the earlier occasions and her husband sharing part of his salary to her mother-in-law. The family members of the deceased namely, PW-1 to PW-3 had deposed about the earlier demands made by the accused persons leading to cruelty. PW-5 (Mr.Rajan) who is running a grocery shop near the deceased parental home at Arumbakkam had deposed about attending the marriage of the deceased and her visit to the grandmother's home four months prior to the death complaining harassment by father-in-law and mother-in-law. Followed by the visit of the accused persons one week thereafter and quarrel between both the families regarding sending back Sagana Devi to her marital home. He has also deposed that thereafter, the family members of Sagana Devi took Sagana Devi to her matrimonial home and left her at her matrimonial home advising A1 not to behave rudely with Sagana Devi since she is at her advanced stage of pregnancy. To impeach its credibility certain questions put in the cross examination of PW-5, however, his evidence substantially corroborate the evidence of PW-1 and PW-3.

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

16. The learned counsel appearing for the appellants strongly rely upon the deposition of PW-4 (Kousalya,) who had stated that on seeing smoke coming out from the portion where the deceased was living, she went and found the deceased burning and A1 sleeping. Only she woke up A-1 and he put out fire on the deceased. Ex.D1 medical certificate given by DW-4 proves A1 sustained burn injuries. PW-4 stated that both the deceased and A1 stayed 15 days in portion of her house as tenant and there was no quarrel between them. On the date of occurrence, the grandmother of the deceased visited her.


17. It is very hard to believe a person, who was in the other portion of the house was able to see the smoke and rushed to the place, but, A1, who was in the same room sleeping and PW-4 woke him up. Whether he was really sleeping or pretending as if sleeping, is a question left open.

18. To prove their innocence, the accused have chosen to examine four witnesses. A1 himself mounted the witness box and examined as DW1 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and subjected himself to cross examination. DW-2 is the wife of A2's brother. DW-3 is husband of A2's sister. DW-4 is the private clinic doctor, who treated A1's burn injuries on 28.04.2008.


19. A1, who was examined as DW1 in the cross examination denies the quarrel on 27.04.2008 between him and the deceased regarding sharing his salary with his mother. In fact, all the incriminating evidence spoken by the prosecution witnesses were specifically put to DW1 in the cross examination and he has denied everything. He in his chief examination admits that he was in the house, when the deceased set fire to herself. According to him, on 27.04.2008 at between 11.00 and 11.30 a.m., PW-1 and PW-3 came to his house and he went out to purchase vegetables. When he came back, he heard his wife, PW-1 and PW-3 were loudly discussing and his wife was very dull. When he enquired her, she stated that PW-3 demands necklace from her (deceased). Thereafter, he went to his room and slept. He woke up only when the house owner knocked the door of his room. He had further deposed that he put out the fire by pouring water and covering her with bedspread. When he enquired his wife, why she had done https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis this, his wife said that since PW-3 scolded her, she has committed suicide.

20. If what DW-1 deposed is true, then PW-4 (house owner), who was present at that time and knocked the door to wake up the accused (DW-1) would have deposed about what the deceased said to DW1. But, PW-4 has said nothing about the visit of PW-1. Neither she has said anything about quarrel of PW-3 with the deceased. Thus, the accused has chosen to mount the witness box to establish that neither on the date of occurrence nor any day earlier there was quarrel between him and his wife, contrarily on 27.04.2008 there was wordy quarrel only between PW-3 and the deceased, when PW-3 came along with PW-1 to visit the deceased. His evidence is not corroborated by the house owner (PW-4), who was present in her house, except the fact that on that day the grandmother of the deceased (PW-7) visited the house, PW-4 has not said anything about the visit of PW-3 and she had quarrel with the deceased during the mid day. Therefore, DW-1 deposition to discredit the evidence of the prosecution witnesses has to fail for lack of corroboration.

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

21. From the evidence available, it is clearly proved beyond doubt that the deceased Sagana Devi, who got married on 22.02.2007 was driven to commit suicide by dousing herself with kerosene on 27.04.2008 at 4.00 p.m and succumbed to injury on 28.04.2008 at 07.15 a.m. As far as the person caused cruelty, in her statement to the police, she has mentioned her mother-in-law (A2) and sister-in-law (A4), but in the Accident Register (Ex.P7) she has named all the four accused as persons caused cruelty. In dying declaration recorded by the Metropolitan Magistrate, the fight with her husband regarding sharing the salary with mother-in-law alone mentioned. In the Accident Register mentioning the names of the accused is something unusual. Probably, the Doctor would have thought on seeing the health condition of the injured better to record the names specifically instead of recording as 'known persons'. These names and relationship with the injured disclosed by the injured and exclusively within her knowledge. No other persons except A1 were with the injured at that time to suspect that the injured was tutored to implicate A1 to A4.

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

22. Therefore, on cumulative assessment of the evidence, this Court finds that the demand of house hold articles and sharing the salary with A2 by A1 and A1 had caused cruelty. It was the last straw on the camel's back, giving substantial portion out of his meagre salary to his mother and forcing the deceased to run the family with hardly Rs.2000/- and meet out the family expenses and the house rent.


23. If setting up separate family was the issue between the spouse as contended by the learned counsel appearing for the appellants, there is no need for the deceased to commit suicide, 15 days after setting up a separate family. If there was any quarrel with PW-3 regarding the necklace on the date of occurrence, that would have been spoken by PW-4 the house owner in her evidence.


24. One of the contention made in this appeal is when the trial Court found the accused not guilty of charge under Section 304 (B) @ 306 IPC, the same reasoning applies for the charge under Section 498 A IPC also. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

25. This submission is not sustainable in view of the fact that offences under Section 304 (B) IPC and Section 498A IPC are distinct offences. The required ingredients are different, though the common ingredient is 'cruelty'. This point is no more res integra, in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Gurmeet Singh -vs- State of Punjab reported in [(2021)6 SCC 108], which has given a quietus to the controversy. This observation has been made in tune with the earlier judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court rendered in Kamesh Panjiyar -vs- State of Bihar reported in [(2005) 2 SC 388] wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as below:-

“20. Therefore, the argument raised by the counsel on behalf of the appellant cannot be accepted as the offences under Section 498A and Section 304B IPC are distinct in nature. Although cruelty is a common thread existing in both the offences, however, the ingredients of each offence are distinct and must be proved separately by the prosecution. If a case is made out, there can be a conviction under both the sections.”
26. Hence, for the aforesaid reasons, this Court hold that A1 and A2 had caused cruelty which has driven Sagana Devi to commit suicide. The https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court against A1 and A2 is confirmed.


27. Since there is no evidence reliable evidence against A3 and A4 for any act of cruelty to the deceased Sagana Devi, the conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court on A3 and A4 is set aside.

28. As far as the sentence of A1 and A2 concerned, for the offence of Section 498A IPC, the trial Court imposed the maximum sentence of 3 years RI and fine of Rs.5,000/-, in default to undergo 3 months SI. Taking note of the fact that the second appellant is now a senior citizen and the first appellant has to upbring his motherless son, the period of sentence is reduced from 3 years RI into 1 year RI with fine of Rs.5,000/-, in default 3 months SI.


29. In the result, this Criminal Appeal is allowed in respect of appellants 3 and 4/accused 3 and 4. The judgment of conviction and sentence passed against the appellants 3 and 4/accused 3 and 4 is set aside. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis The appellants 3 and 4/accused 3 and 4 are set at liberty. Bail bond, if any executed by the appellants 3 and 4/accused 3 and 4 shall stand cancelled. The fine amounts paid, if any, by the appellants 3 and 4/accused 3 and 4, shall be refunded.


30. In respect of the appellants 1 and 2/accused 1 and 2, this Criminal Appeal is partly allowed. The sentence imposed on A1 and A2 by the trial Court viz., the Sessions Judge, (Magaliar Neethimandaram), Chennai in S.C.No.73 of 2013 dated 17.07.2014 is hereby modified. The suspension of sentence already granted to the appellants 1 and 2/accused 1 and 2 by this Court is cancelled. The sentence of 3 years RI with fine of Rs.5,000/- stands modified as one year RI with fine of Rs.5,000/- in default, 3 months SI. The trial Court is directed to secure the appellants 1 and 2/accused 1 and 2 to undergo the remaining period of sentence imposed on them.

                                                                      to undergo one month
                                                                      S.I.
3. Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the petitioner herein preferred C.A.No.22 of 2017 and same was heard and decided by the XV Additional Sessions Judge, Chennai, which partly allowed the appeal and acquitted the petitioner herein for the charge under Section 406 of IPC, whereas, confirmed the sentence and conviction for offences under Section 498A of IPC and Section 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act.


4. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner would submit that the marriage which was solemnised on 31.03.2006, broke down within three days an the day of their marriage reception held in a hotel. During the reception there was quarrel between the petitioner and his brother-in-law i.e., the brother of the defacto complainant. This https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis quarrel ended in into physical altercation. Being humiliated by the said altercation, the petitioner herein left the reception hall. Thereafter, he tried his best to reconcile through e-mail and phone for nearly four months, but due to her ego and family pressure, she did not come to any terms. Therefore, he was forced to file a divorce petition.

5. To counter and get over her fault and her family members fault, the complaint has been filed as if he demanded gold jewels and money for the marriage as dowry, since his demand was not made, he walked out during the reception.


6. Further, the learned counsel for the petitioner would also submit that the complaint to portrait the petitioner as a man of immorality and they have also made an allegation that he was married and also he is making all attempts to get married again by suppressing the earlier marriage with the defacto complainant and submitting that the Courts below have failed to consider the sequence of the events and the documents produced, more particularly, the entire videograph taken https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis during the reception which is fatal to the prosecution.

7. The learned Government Advocate (Crl.Side) for the respondent would submit that the prosecution has proved the case by examining 15 witnesses and marked 46 exhibits. Though the defence has examined and marked 10 exhibits, it no way discharge the burden of presumption against them. The break down of the marriage within 3 days and the walk out of the petitioner herein during the reception is evidence to show that the petitioner was expected something unlawful and illegal which cannot be met by the defacto complainant and her family members. The prosecution through its witnesses has adduced evidence to show that the break down of the marriage within three days of solemnised was purely due to cruelty caused by the petitioner to the defacto complainant and due to unreasonable demand of dowry.

8. The perusal of evidence besides the finding of the appellate Court go to show that the prosecution has proved beyond doubt that the marriage between the defacto complainant and the petitioner https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis herein was solemnised on 31.03.2006. The appellate Court on re- appreciation of the evidence has acquitted the petitioner herein for the offence under Section 406 of IPC, however, confirmed the conviction and sentence for the offence under Section 498A of IPC and Section 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act.


9. The prime contention of the petitioner is that there is no proof for demand and no evidence to show that the break down of marriage was due to demand of dowry or cruelty caused by the petitioner herein. Pointing out the marriage was a short lived marriage for only three days and the possibility of allegations causing mental or physical cruelty is highly doubtful. Even according to the prosecution, if there was some quarrel in connection with the demand of dowry during the reception and the same has been been videographed, the best evidence will be the videograph, which voluntarily withheld by the prosecution in spite of the memo filed by the petitioner for production of videograph. Therefore, the learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the correctness and legality of the finding of the Courts below requires revision. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

10. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner would also submit that Ex.D1 to Ex.D10 and the deposition of the appellant were not properly appreciated, which has led to miscarriage of justice. It is an admitted fact that the betrothal between PW.4 and the petitioner herein took place on 03.02.2006. Thereafter, the petitioner was infected with Chickenpox and there are evidence to speak, for the said reason, there was some delay in conducting the marriage and at last on 31.03.2006, the marriage was solemnised.


11. According to PW.1, who is an independent witness, before coming to the marriage hall there was some misunderstanding between the family members of the bride and the family members of the bridegroom. There was dispute regarding certain customary ceremonies to be conducted after the marriage solemnised. Thereafter, the dispute was resolved and on 02.04.2006, the reception was arranged.

12. PW.11 / Videographer, who covered the event, had deposed that the reception was organised at Aishwarya Mahal, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Koyambedu, Chennai. At that time, there was heated arguments between the mother of the defacto complainant on one side and the father and brother of the petitioner on the other side. The petitioner and his family members refused to co-operate with him for taking photos. When he enquired, they told that due to dispute regarding jewels, they are fighting. Soon thereafter, the petitioner and his family members walked out from the reception hall. This witness was subjected to cross examination. In the cross examination, he has reiterated that he heard that the dispute was because of jewels agreed to be given. But he could not identify the person who informed that to him. He has admitted that he has covered the petitioner, who was frequently moving on and off the dias agitatedly.

13. The learned counsel for the petitioner on the fact would submit that the said photograph was not produced and this witness to the occurrence was only hearsay.


14. This Court is of the view that PW.1 and PW.11 are independent witnesses, who have spoken broadly about the arrangement https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis made prior to the marriage and the incident took place during the reception. It is an admitted fact that the petitioner herein walked out from the reception hall abruptly and thereafter the defacto complainant and the petitioner never got united, though there are some materials to show that there were contacting through e-mail and phone. This may not sufficient to show that the withdrawal of the matrimonial home in the middle of reception, could not have caused any mental cruelty to the defacto complainant.


15. The learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the petitioner has mounted the witness box and established his innocence and marked 10 Exhibits to show that there was no demand of dowry.

16. The perusal of the defence documents, particularly, the alleged conversation between the defacto complainant and the petitioner herein after their separation from the reception hall on 02.04.2006, only reinforced the fact that the defacto complainant / PW.4 was subjected to mental cruelty by this petitioner. Particularly, the alleged conversation on https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 18.05.2006 would show that the petitioner has admitted causing notice through his counsel to get divorce with all falsehood and justify the same on the pretext that the notice was issued only to pressurise the defacto complainant to join him. However, he also candidly admits that he demanded 100 sovereigns of jewel, but had pleaded that he was forced to demand 100 sovereigns at that point of time. To cap in the course of the conversation, the defacto complainant has said by deceiving her, the petitioner making her mentally sick and therefore, she has no interest in continuing any conversation with him. This gives quietus in the petitioner's case and this Court finds no illegality or error in the findings of the appellate Court judgment, which has confirmed the conviction under Section 498A of IPC.


17. The learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that now the defacto complainant is married and settled down in abroad and the case is pending for nearly 16 years. Taking note of the fact, some leniency may be shown to the petitioner regarding the sentence ordered. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

18. Taking note of the submissions and other factors while confirming the conviction under Section 498A and Section 4 of D.P. Act, this Court is of the view that the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner for the offence under Section 498A of IPC shall be reduced from three years Simple Imprisonment to two years Simple Imprisonment. As far as the sentence imposed for the offence under Section 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act is concerned, one year Simple Imprisonment is confirmed. The period of sentence shall run concurrently.

19. In the result,

(i) this Criminal Revision Case is partly allowed.

(ii) the sentence imposed on the revision petitioner/accused by the appellate Court is modified to two years S.I. instead of three years S.I., for the offence under Section 498A of IPC.

(iii) the period of imprisonment already undergone by the revision petitioner shall be set off. The learned trial judge shall take steps to enforce this judgment.

Shubham Balmiki @ Nanhe vs State Of U.P. on 8 January, 2025
1. List has been revised.

2. Heard Sri Vishnu Kant Tiwari and Sri Sadashiv Tripathi, learned counsels for the applicant and Sri R.P. Patel, learned State Law Officer and perused the record.

3. Applicant seeks bail in Case Crime No. 63 of 2024, under Sections 323, 498A, 304B I.P.C. and Section 3/4 of D.P. Act, Police Station Panki, District Kanpur Nagar, during the pendency of trial.

PROSECUTION STORY:

4. The love marriage of the applicant was solemnized with the deceased person on 31.12.2023. The applicant is stated to have beaten her up several times and even subjected her to cruelty for demand of dowry and committed her murder in the night of 4/5.02.2024 at about 11 p.m.

5. The applicant is stated to have have given the information to the brother of the informant about the suicide committed by the deceased person in the night itself.

ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF APPLICANT :

6. The applicant has been falsely implicated in the present case and he has nothing to do with the said offence.

7. The FIR is delayed by about three days and there is no explanation of the said delay caused.

8. The applicant himself had informed the police about the suicide committed by his wife.

9. The informant was very much present at the time of inquest proceeding undertaken by the police on 05.02.2024 which was completed by 10:35 p.m.

10. The informant is the panch witness no.1 in the inquest proceeding and he has not whispered a single word against the applicant at that stage.

11. It is true that the deceased had expired within the precincts of the house of the applicant but she has committed suicide after depression under duress of the informant himself.

12. Several other submissions have been made on behalf of the applicant to demonstrate the falsity of the allegations made against him. The circumstances which, as per counsel, led to the false implication of the applicant have also been touched upon at length.

13. There is no criminal history of the applicant. The applicant is languishing in jail since 13.02.2024. The applicant is ready to cooperate with trial. In case, the applicant is released on bail, he will not misuse the liberty of bail.

ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF STATE :

14. The bail application has been opposed but the submissions raised by the learned counsel for the applicant could not be disputed.

CONCLUSION:

15. In light of the judgement of the Supreme Court passed in Niranjan Singh and another vs Prabhakar Rajaram Kharote and others AIR 1980 SC 785, this Court has avoided detailed examination of the evidence and elaborate documentation of the merits of the case as no party should have the impression that his case has been prejudiced. A prima facie satisfaction of case is needed but it is not the same as an exhaustive exploration of the merits in the order itself.

16. The well-known principle of ""Presumption of Innocence Unless Proven Guilty,"" gives rise to the concept of bail as a rule and imprisonment as an exception.

17. A person's right to life and liberty, guaranteed by Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, cannot be taken away simply because the person is accused of committing an offence until the guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt. Article 21 of the Indian Constitution states that no one's life or personal liberty may be taken away unless the procedure established by law is followed, and the procedure must be just and reasonable. The said principle has been recapitulated by the Supreme Court in Satender Kumar Antil Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and Ors., 2022 INSC 690.

18. Reiterating the aforesaid view the Supreme Court in the case of Manish Sisodia Vs. Directorate of Enforcement 2024 INSC 595 has again emphasised that the very well-settled principle of law that bail is not to be withheld as a punishment is not to be forgotten. It is high time that the Courts should recognize the principle that ""bail is a rule and jail is an exception"".

19. Learned State Law Officer could not bring forth any exceptional circumstances which would warrant denial of bail to the applicant.

20. It is settled principle of law that the object of bail is to secure the attendance of the accused at the trial. No material particulars or circumstances suggestive of the applicant fleeing from justice or thwarting the course of justice or creating other troubles in the shape of repeating offences or intimidating witnesses and the like have been shown by learned State Law Officer.

21. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, submissions made by learned counsel for the parties, the evidence on record, and without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, the Court is of the view that the applicant has made out a case for bail. The bail application is allowed.

22. Let the applicant-Shubham Balmiki @ Nanhe involved in aforementioned case crime number be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned subject to following conditions.

(i) The applicant shall not tamper with evidence.
(ii) The applicant shall remain present, in person, before the Trial Court on dates fixed for (1) opening of the case, (2) framing of charge and (3) recording of statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. If in the opinion of the Trial Court absence of the applicant is deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall be open for the Trial Court to treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed against him in accordance with law.
23. In case of breach of any of the above conditions, it shall be a ground for cancellation of bail. Identity, status and residence proof of the applicant and sureties be verified by the court concerned before the bonds are accepted.

24. It is made clear that observations made in granting bail to the applicant shall not in any way affect the learned trial Judge in forming his independent opinion based on the testimony of the witnesses.

This petition has been filed seeking to quash the proceedings pending in C.C.No.196 of 2014, on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate, Udhagamandalam, Nilgiri District.

http://www.judis.nic.in

2. The case of the prosecution is that the petitioner is the husband of the second respondent and they got married on 26.08.2011. It is further alleged that the petitioner demanded dowry and committed mental cruelty upon her. The physical cruelty that was committed by the petitioner upon the second respondent has also been stated in the final report.

3. The FIR was initially registered for an offence under Sections 417, 420 and 498A of IPC. On the completion of the investigation, the final report was filed only for an offence under Section 498 A of IPC and other two offences were given up. The Court below also took cognizance of the final report only for an offence under Section 498 A of IPC.

4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the very prosecution against the petitioner is not maintainable due to the fact that there was no husband and wife relationship between the petitioner and the second respondent. The learned counsel submitted that the petitioner was working as a Sub Inspector of Police and the second respondent had developed some relationship with the petitioner. However, the fact remains that the second respondent was already married to one Satheesan and the said marriage is still in subsistence.

http://www.judis.nic.in

5. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that departmental proceedings were initiated against the petitioner after the criminal proceedings were commenced and in the departmental proceedings, the second respondent had also deposed as a witness. While, deposing as a witness, the second respondent has categorically stated that the first marriage is still in subsistence and this was well within the knowledge of the petitioner and inspite of the same, the petitioner had agreed to marry the second respondent.


6. The learned counsel submitted that the fact regarding the first marriage of the 2nd respondent and its subsistence is supported by the marriage certificate and also the admission of the 2nd respondent about the said fact, during the departmental enquiry. Therefore, under such circumstances, the learned counsel submitted that the prosecution under Section 498 A of IPC, is not sustainable against the petitioner.

7. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent police submitted that the respondent police, in the course of investigation, have collected sufficient materials in order to prove the physical and mental cruelty that was undergone by the 2nd respondent in the hands of the petitioner. The learned counsel further submitted that the issue as to whether the 2nd respondent was already married and whether there was a http://www.judis.nic.in valid marriage between the petitioner and the 2nd respondent, are all matters of evidence and the same can be found out only in the course of the trial. The learned counsel submitted that the said exercise cannot be done by this Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. Therefore, the learned counsel submitted that the petitioner must be made to undergo the trial before the Court below.

8. The 2nd respondent has been served the notice and her name has also been printed in the cause list. However, there is no appearance for the 2nd respondent. Therefore, this Court proceeds to dispose of this case on merits.


9. It is true that this Court cannot conduct a roving enquiry and assess the evidence at the stage of considering a petition filed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. However, the only exception that has been provided by the Hon'ble Supreme Court are in cases, where there are materials of sterling quality available before the Court. In such cases, this Court can always rely upon those documents, over which there is no dispute and they are of sterling and unimpeachable quality.


10. In the instant case, there are two materials that are available under this category. The first material is the marriage registration http://www.judis.nic.in certificate of the second respondent. This registration certificate has been issued by the marriage officer of Palakkad District under the Special Marriage Act. It is found in the certificate that the 2nd respondent is married to one Satheesan. The next material that is available before this Court is the voter ID, wherein, the first respondent's husband's name is found as Satheesan. The 2nd respondent has participated during the departmental enquiry, as a witness and she has categorically admitted the fact that she is married to Satheesan and she has not obtained any divorce and when the first marriage was in force, she has married the petitioner again in the 2011.


11. It is clear from the above that there was no valid marriage between the petitioner and the 2nd respondent and there is no husband and wife relationship between the parties.


12. The next issue that comes up for consideration is whether the prosecution can sustain the charge under Section 498 A of IPC, even in a case, where there is no husband and wife relationship between the parties?

13. The learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon two judgments of the Kerala High Court. The first judgment is in Suprabha Vs.State of Kerala reported in 2014(1) Cri.CC 723: 2013(3) Ker L.J.447:

http://www.judis.nic.in 2013 (4) R.C.R (Criminal) 248: 2013 (3) KLT 514: 2013 (130) AIC 947:
2013 (3) DMC 873: 2014(1) Crimes 93 and and other judgment in Unnikrishnan @ Chandu, S/o.Velayudhan, Parayil House, Pallipuram Vs.State of Kerala, Represented by the Public Prosecutor, High Court of Kerala, Ernakulam reported in 2017(3) Ker LJ 918: 2017 (3) DMC 477:
2017 (3) KLT 991: 2017 (4) ILR (Kerala) 822: 2018 (1) Cri.CC 166 :
2018 (181) AIC 727 : 2018 Cri. LJ 265: 2018 (2) Crimes 201: 2018 (2) AICLR 383.
14. In the judgment in Suprabha Vs.State of Kerala, referred supra, the relevant portions of the judgment is extracted hereunder:

8. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, a valid marriage is a necessary ingredient to invite an offence under Section 498 A of the Indian Penal Code. At the same time, the learned counsel for the defacto complainant has strenuously contended that any valid marriage is no required to invite offence under Section 498 A of the Indian Penal Code, whereas a long cohabitation in the form of a marriage is sufficient. The learned counsel for the petitioer has invited my attention to the decision of a three Judges' Bench of the Supreme Court in Shivcharan Lal Verma & Anr. v.
State of M.P., (2002) (2) Crimes 177 SC : JT (2002)2 SC

641) wherein the Apex Court held that in order to attract an offence under Section 498 A of the Indian Penal Code, the http://www.judis.nic.in subsistence of a valid marriage is required. In the case relating to the decision in Shivcharan Lal Vrma's case (Supra), the marriage in question was null and void on account of the subsistence of another valid marriage. It was held as follows:

''.... One, whether the prosecution under S.498A can at all be attracated since the marriage with Mohini itself was null and void, the same having been performed during the lifetime of Kalindi. Second, whether the conviction under S.306 could at all be sustained in the absence of any positive material to hold that Mohini committed suicide because of any positive act on the part of either Shiv Charan or Kalindi. There may be considerable force in the argument of Mr.Khanduja, learned counsel for the appellant so far as conviction under S.498 A is concerne, inasmuch as the alleged marriaged with Mohini during the subsistence of valid marriage with kalindi is null and void. We, therefore, set aside the conviction and sentence under S.498A of the I.P.C.'' The said decision has been followed in Suvetha v.Inspector of Police reported in 2009(2) R.C.R.(Criminal) 923: 2009 (3) Recent Apex Judgments (R.A.J.) 458: 2009(2) KLT 686(SC), by the Apex Court.
9. The learned counsel for the defacto complainant has invited my attention to the decision in Subbharao v. State of A.P.reported in 2009(2) R.C.R.(Criminal) 860: 2009 (3) Recent Apex Judgments (R.A.J.) 3888: 2009(2) KLT 531 (SC), wherein it was held that:
http://www.judis.nic.in ''The absence of a definition of 'husband' to specifically include such persons who contracaat marriages ostensibly and cohabitate with such woman, in the purported exercise of his role and status as 'husband' is no ground to exclude them from the purview of S.304 B or 498A. IPC.'' It has to be noted that in the said decision, the earlier decision of the three Judges' Bench in Shivcharan Lal Verma's case (Supra) was not mentioned or considered.
10. Similarly, the learned counsel for the defacto complainant as well as the learned Public Prosecutor has pointed out the decision in Aravindan v. State of kerala reportd in [2005 (3) R.C.R. (Criminal) 984 : 2005(3) KLT 157] rendered by a learned Single Judge of this Court, wherein it was held that:
'' The expression 'husband' in S.498 A covers such persons who enters into marital relationship and under the colour of such proclaimed status of husband coheres her in any manner, for any of the purposes enumerated in S.304 B or 498 A.'' When there is a binding precedent by a three Judges' Bench of the Apex Court in the matter, this Court is bound to follow the dictum laid down by the Apex Court n the said decision. Relying on the decision in Shivcharan Lal Verma's case (Supra), it has to be found that an offence under Section 498 -A cannot be invited in this particular case for any period http://www.judis.nic.in prior to 14.10.2003. As far as any period after 14.10.2003 concerned, there is no valid allegation in the private complaint in order to invite the ingredients of Section 498 A of the Indian Penal Code.
15. In the judgment in Unnikrishnan @ Chandu, S/o.Velayudhan, Parayil House, Pallipuram Vs.State of Kerala, referred supra, the relevant portions of the judgment is extracted hereunder:

The trend of the earlier decisions was that for a conviction under section 498A IPC, the prosecution must prove a valid marital relationship between the deceased and the accused. There occurred a change in the trend when the Honourable Supreme Court interpreted section 498A IPC in view of the absence of the definition of the word ''husband'', and held that even long co-habitation as man and wife will attract a prosecution under section 498A IPC. The Honourable Supreme Court so decided in Reema Agarwal v. Anupam, 2004 (2) KLT 822 SC, and later in Koppisetti Subbharao @ Subrahmaniam v. State of Andhra Pradesh, AIR (2009) SC 2684. In Koppisetti Subbharao's case, the Honourable Supreme Court held in paragraph 6 of the judgment thus, ''....................there could be no impediment in law to liberally construe the words or expressions relating to the persons committing the offence so as to rope in not only those validly married, but also any one who has undergone some or other form of marriage, and thereby http://www.judis.nic.in assume for himself the position of husband to live, co- habitat and exercise authority as such husband over another woman..................................'.' It is pertinent to note that prior to the above decisions, a three Judge Bench of the Honourable Supreme Court had decided otherwise, that the mental or physical harassment of a lady who had not been legally married by the accused, will not attract a prosecution under Section 498A IPC. In Shivcharan Lal Verma and Another v. State of Madhya Pradesh, 2002 (2) Crimes 177 SC: JT 2002(2) SC 641, the three Judge Bench held that for a prosecution under section 498A IPC, there must be a valid marital relationship between the accused and the victim. That is a case where a second wife committed suicide, allegedly due to the acts of cruelty of her husband and the former wife. The victim's marriage with the accused in the said case was void ab initio. For the said reason, the Honourable Supreme Court held that a conviction under Section 498A cannot be sustained. The decision was followed by the Honourable Supreme Court later in U.Suvetha v. State by Inspector of Police and Another, (2009) Crl.L.J. 2974. Following the decision of the Honourable Supreme Court cited above in Shivcharan Lal Verma's case, this Court also held in Suprabh-a v. State of Kerala, 2013 (3) KLT 514 that , only a legally wedded wife can claim the protection under section 498A IPC, and that in the absence of such a legal relationship as husband and wife, there cannot be a conviction under section 498A http://www.judis.nic.in IPC. In the present case, the relationship of the accused and the deceased was only a live-in relationship. Even in Koppisetti Subbharao's case, the Honourable Supreme Court held that the parties must have undergone some sort of ceremonies with the object of getting married. In this case, the parties, admittedly , had not undergone any such ceremony, and they just started living as man and wife.
Thus , I find that on legal ground itself, the accused is entitled for acquittal. In the above circumstances, it is not necessary to go into the factual aspects as regards the allegation of cruelty and harassment.


In the result, the appeal is allowed. The appellant is not found guilty of the offence under section 498A IPC, and he is acquitted of the said offence in appeal under section 386(b)(i) of Cr.P.C., 1973 Accordingly, the conviction and sentence against him in S.C.No.650 of 2006 of the Court below will stand set aside. The appellant is released from prosecution, and the bail bond, if any, executed by him will stand discharged.


16. It is clear from the above judgments that only a legally wedded wife can claim protection under Section 498 A of IPC and in the absence of such a legal relationship as husband and wife, there cannot be a conviction under Section 498 A of IPC. The three member Bench of the Hon'ble http://www.judis.nic.in Supreme Court, that has been referred in both the judgments, categorically holds that in order to attract an offence under Section 498 A of IPC, the subsistence of a valid marriage is a sine-qua-non. Where the marriage itself is null and void, on account of the subsistence of another valid marriage, the prosecution cannot sustain a charge under Section 498 A of IPC.

17. This Court is in complete agreement with the judgment of the Kerala High Court.


18. The facts of this case is squarely covered by the above judgments. In this case, there was no relationship of husband and wife between the petitioner and the 2nd respondent, since there was a subsisting marriage between the 2nd respondent and one Satheesan. This is established beyond doubts by materials, which has already been referred supra.


19. In the result, the proceedings against the petitioner cannot be sustained for an offence under Section 498 A of IPC and therefore the continuation of the proceedings is an abuse of process of Court which requires interference of this Court under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. http://www.judis.nic.in

20. The proceedings in C.C.No.196 of 2014, on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate, Udhagamandalam, Nilgiri District, is hereby quashed and this Criminal Original Petition is allowed accordingly. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed.

                                                          JUDGMENT
This appeal has been preferred by Accused No.1 to 3, challenging the conviction and sentence under Section 498A I.P.C. Originally there were four accused and A4 has been acquitted by the trial court under Section 304(b) and 498A of IPC and Section (4) of the Dowry Prohibition Act. Accused Nos.1 to 3, who are the husband, father-in-law and mother- in-law of the deceased, were found guilty under Section 498A IPC and each of them have been convicted and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of two years, http://www.judis.nic.in to pay a fine of Rs.1000/- and in default, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of six months. Challenging the said conviction and sentence, the Accused Nos.1 to 3 have preferred this appeal.


2. The deceased Kavitha is the wife of the first accused and daughter in law of second and third accused. The marriage between the deceased and the first accused took place on 16.02.1997. At the time of marriage, there was negotiation between both the parties and the parents of the deceased Kavitha agreed to give 20 sovereigns of gold, household articles and cash of Rs.10,000/-. The parents of Kavitha were not able to give the cash ie., Rs.10,000/-. However, they had looked after the delivery expenses of Kavitha (deceased). About three months prior to the death of Kavitha, she was in the house of her parents for her second delivery and the expenses were borne by the parents of the deceased Kavitha. At the time when A1 was in custody in connection with a theft case, the responsibility of maintaining the deceased and her children were taken care of only by the parents of the deceased. As the parents of Kavitha were not able to pay the sum of Rs.10,000/- , A1 started harassing the deceased. When the deceased returned to the matrimonial home along with the second child, A1 along with the other accused removed the saree of the deceased and threw it away. Aggrieved over the same, the deceased was driven to the extent of drowning herself in the well belonging to one Palanisamy, in respect of which the village administrative officer has preferred the complaint.


3. After the investigation, final report was filed alleging that A1 to A4 was responsible for the death of the deceased, and the final report was under Sections 304(b) and 498 IPC; http://www.judis.nic.in 11 witnesses were examined, 14 documents were marked and 8 material objects were exhibited. Only one witness has been examined on the side of the defence. The defence witness stated that the accused were not guilty of tonsuring the head of the deceased; and it was the voluntary act on the part of the deceased during the tonsuring function, as she felt that the tonsure should be done for odd number of persons and she volunteered herself to make the number of persons to three.


4. With regard to the cause of death, the post mortem report states that the death was due to suffocation on account of drowning. So far as the RDO report is concerned, he would state that it was a case of demand for dowry and based on that further enquiry has been held by the police officials. The trial court has examined the case in proper perspective and has given a finding that the offence under Sections 304(b) has not been proved and offence under Section 498A has been proved.


5. The trial court has analysed the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses. The village administrative officer (P.W.1) has given evidence stating that on 03.02.2000, there was wordy quarrel between the accused and the deceased and thereafter the deceased was found missing; and that on 04.02.2000, her dead body was found in the well belonging to one Palanisami. PWs.2 and 3 are the parents of the deceased. They have given evidence that there was demand for dowry. Their case is that the death is only on account of demand for dowry. The stand of non examination of independent witness also cannot be taken in cases of this nature, as it is futile to rely on independent witness in matters relating to family disputes. So far as the demand of Rs.10,000/- is concerned, the trial court has given a http://www.judis.nic.in finding that after the marriage, for two deliveries, Kavitha has come to the house of the parents and on each occasion after the delivery, A1 had come to the house of his in-laws to take the deceased back to his home and therefore the demand for dowry has not been proved by the prosecution. With regard to the tonsure of the head of the deceased, P.W.1 the father of the deceased stated that on telephonic information that the accused have tonsured the head of the deceased, he went to the house of A1 and asked A1 regarding the same. A1 responded to him saying that Kavitha / the deceased should act only in accordance with the instructions of his parents / A2 and A3 and he would not interfere in the affairs. Thereafter, A1 is stated to have been in confinement with respect to the theft case for a period of three months. About two days prior to Deepavali, Kavitha had been left at her matrimonial home by P.W.1 and at that time, A3 removed the saree of the deceased, placed the same over her head and poured water, and yelled at her saying that if she wants to go with her parents she can go back and only if she decides to leave her parents, she can come inside. Thereafter, the deceased told P.W.1 that whatever happens is her fate and went inside the matrimonial home.

6. The trial court has given a finding that the acts of cruelty are not done publicly and hence the non examination of the neighbours of the accused will not save the accused from their acts of guilty. That apart, no daughter in law would prefer a complaint against her inlaws unless there is a real cruelty. Therefore, the trial court has come to the conclusion that there was physical as well as mental cruelty caused to the deceased by the accused 1 to 3, which is proved by both oral and documentary evidence.

http://www.judis.nic.in

7. Explaining the problem of examining independent witness in matrimonial matters, the Honourable Supreme Court has held that "" When harassment and cruelty is meted out to a woman within the four walls of the matrimonial home, it is difficult to get independent witnesses to depose about it. Only the inmates of the house and the relatives of the husband, who cause the cruelty, witness it. Their servants, being under their obligation, would never depose against them.

Proverbially, neighbours are slippery witnesses. Moreover, witnesses have a tendency to stay away from courts. This is more so with neighbours. In bride burning cases who else will, therefore, depose about the misery of the deceased bride except her parents or her relatives? It is time we accept this reality. We, therefore, reject this submission.""

8. With regard to the applicability of presumption under Section 113(b) of the Evidence Act, there is no discussion at all in the trial court judgment.

8.1. There is no appeal filed by the State, challenging the acquittal of the accused under Section 304(b) IPC and only the conviction of the Accused 1 to 3 under Section 498A IPC is under challenge. The trial court has believed the evidence of the parents of the deceased Kavitha considering the facts and circumstances, and has found that A1 to A3 are guilty of the offence under Section 498A IPC.

http://www.judis.nic.in

9. In Shobha Rani vs Madhukar Reddi reported in AIR 1988 AIR 121, the Supreme Court has held as follows.


"" Explanation to Sec. 498 A provides that any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive a woman to commit suicide would constitute cruelty. Such wilful conduct which is likely to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical of the woman) would also amount to cruelty. Harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security would also constitute cruelty.""
10. Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 states that when the question is whether a person has committed the dowry death of a woman, and it is shown that soon before her death such woman has been subjected by such person to cruelty or harassment for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, the court shall presume that such person had caused the dowry death. Section 304B of the IPC states that where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called 'dowry death', and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death. http://www.judis.nic.in

11. The Honourable Supreme Court in Surinder Singh Vs. State of Haryana, held as follows.

"" The words 'soon before' appear in Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and also in Section 304B of the IPC. For the presumptions contemplated under these Sections to spring into action, it is necessary to show that the cruelty or harassment was caused soon before the death. The interpretation of the words 'soon before' is, therefore, important. The question is how 'soon before'? This would obviously depend on facts and circumstances of each case. The cruelty or harassment differs from case to case. It relates to the mindset of people which varies from person to person. Cruelty can be mental or it can be physical. Mental cruelty is also of different shades. It can be verbal or emotional like insulting or ridiculing or humiliating a woman. It can be giving threats of injury to her or her near and dear ones. It can be depriving her of economic resources or essential amenities of life. It can be putting restraints on her movements. It can be not allowing her to talk to the outside world. The list is illustrative and not exhaustive. Physical cruelty could be actual beating or causing pain and harm to the person of a woman. Every such instance of cruelty and related harassment has a different impact on the mind of a woman. Some instances may be so grave as to have a lasting impact on a woman. Some instances which degrade her dignity may remain etched in her memory for along time. Therefore, 'soon before' is a relative term. In matters of emotions we cannot have fixed formulae. The time-lag may differ from case to case. This must be kept in mind while examining each case of dowry death.""
12. Pointing out these decisions, it is contended by the learned Additional Public Prosecutor that if Section 113B of Evidence Act is applied to the facts of this case, then, the offence under Section 304(b) would be made out and even assuming that the offence under http://www.judis.nic.in Section 304(b) is not made out, the lesser offence of Section 498A is certainly made out. As already pointed out, there is no appeal, challenging aquittal of the accused under Section 304(b). The evidence on record indicates that on two occasions, delivery expenses have been borne out by the parents of the deceased, even though it is customary to bear the expenses only once. When they are able to bear delivery expenses two times, the contention that they were not able to pay Rs.10,000/- is unbelievable. Therefore, it is clear that the dispute was not on account of demand for dowry, but it was on account of some other maladjustment. Immediately prior to the occurrence, the dispute has been with reference to the deceased Kavitha visiting her parents frequently. There was an express instruction that she should not visit her parents' house, and only then, she can be in the matrimonial home. The condition imposed that she should not visit her parents' house, but she would go only at the time of deliveries, would have certainly caused mental cruelty to the deceased. Coupled with this evidence, and the other part of evidence of parents of the deceased, even though do not establish dowry death, would establish the offence of cruelty, and thus, the deceased having been driven to the extent of committing suicide, the accused 1 to 3 are responsible for the offence under Section 498A IPC.


13. Accordingly, considering the facts and circumstances of the case, this court is of the view that the prosecution has successfully proved its case against the appellants under Section 498A IPC. The trial court has rightly held the appellants guilty of offences punishable under Sections 498A of the IPC. However, the occurrence had taken place in the year 2000. The accused 2 and 3 would have become senior citizens. Therefore, sentence already undergone by them would be sufficient towards answering the sentence under Section 498A http://www.judis.nic.in IPC. A1 shall serve out the remaining sentence. The bail bonds executed by A2 and A3 shall stand discharged. The bail bonds of A1 shall stand cancelled and trial court shall secure A1 to serve out the remaining sentence. The appeal is dismissed with the above modification.

     Shampa Dutt (Paul), J.:
1. The present revisional application has been preferred praying for quashing of the proceedings in G.R. Case No. 2275 of 2020 arising out of Bagnan Police Station Case No. 431 of 2020 dated 13.12.2020 under Sections 498A/34 of the Indian Penal Code including Charge Sheet being C.S. No. 205/2021 dated 22.07.2021 pending before the Court of the learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Uluberia, Howrah.

2. In CRR 1195 of 2022, the petitioner is the mother-in-law of the de facto complainant.

3. In CRR 2232 of 2022, the petitioner is the sister-in-law of the de facto complainant.

4. The allegations in the present case are as follows :-

―.....On 13.12.20 at 08.45 hrs received a complaint through India post, the complainant namely Paromita Roy (Das) w/o- Tanmoy Roy of Tenpur, P.O. + PS - Bagnan, Dist. - Howrah to the effect that, she was married with one Tanmoy Roy on 02.03.2017 as per Hindu rites & customs. After her marriage she was subjected to torture both physically and mentally by her husband and other in-laws due to family dispute...........‖
5. Learned counsel for the opposite party no. 2 is present and has submitted that the trial in this case should be permitted to proceed towards trial as the de facto complainant was driven out of her matrimonial home with her minor son on being inflicted with cruelty.

6. The learned counsel for the State has placed the case diary.

7. Section 498A of IPC, lays down:-

""498A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty.--
Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.
Explanation.-- For the purpose of this section, ―cruelty‖ means--
(a)any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or
(b)harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.
Ingredients of offence- The essential ingredients of the offence under sec 498A are as follows:

1) A woman was married;
2) She was subjected to cruelty;
3) Such cruelty consisted in-
i) Any lawful conduct as was likely to drive such woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to her life, limb or health whether mental or physical;
ii) harm to such woman with a view to coercing her to meet unlawful demand for property or valuable security or on account of failure of such woman or any of her relations to meet the lawful demand;
iii) the woman was subjected to such cruelty by her husband or any relation of her husband.‖
8. Considering the materials in the case diary and the decision in the case of Dara Lakshmi Narayana & Ors. vs State of Telangana & Anr., in Criminal Appeal No. ............ of 2024 (arising out of SLP (Criminal) No. 16239 of 2024, decided on December 10, 2024, wherein the Supreme Court held:-

―15. An offence is punishable under Section 498A of the IPC when a husband or his relative subjects a woman to cruelty, which may result in imprisonment for a term extending up to three years and a fine. The Explanation under Section 498A of the IPC defines ―cruelty‖ for the purpose of Section 498A of the IPC to mean any of the acts mentioned in clauses (a) or (b). The first limb of clause (a) of the Explanation of Section 498A of the IPC, states that ―cruelty‖ means any wilful conduct that is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide. The second limb of clause (a) of the Explanation of Section 498A of the IPC, states that cruelty means any wilful conduct that is of such a nature as to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman. Further, clause (b) of the Explanation of Section 498A of the IPC states that cruelty would also include harassment of the woman where such harassment is to coerce her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.
16. Further, Section 3 of the Dowry Act deals with penalty for giving or taking dowry. It states that any person who engages in giving, taking, or abetting the exchange of dowry, shall face a punishment of imprisonment for a minimum of five years and a fine of not less than fifteen thousand rupees or the value of the dowry, whichever is greater. Section 4 of the Dowry Act talks of penalty for demanding dowry. It states that any person demanding dowry directly or indirectly, from the parents or other relatives or guardians of a bride or bridegroom shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months, but which may extend to two years and with fine which may extend to ten thousand rupees.
18. A bare perusal of the FIR shows that the allegations made by respondent No.2 are vague and omnibus. Other than claiming that appellant No.1 harassed her and that appellant Nos.2 to 6 instigated him to do so, respondent No.2 has not provided any specific details or described any particular instance of harassment. She has also not mentioned the time, date, place, or manner in which the alleged harassment occurred. Therefore, the FIR lacks concrete and precise allegations.
25. A mere reference to the names of family members in a criminal case arising out of a matrimonial dispute, without specific allegations indicating their active involvement should be nipped in the bud. It is a well-recognised fact, borne out of judicial experience, that there is often a tendency to implicate all the members of the husband's family when domestic disputes arise out of a matrimonial discord. Such generalised and sweeping accusations unsupported by concrete evidence or particularised allegations cannot form the basis for criminal prosecution. Courts must exercise caution in such cases to prevent misuse of legal provisions and the legal process and avoid unnecessary harassment of innocent family members.
In the present case, appellant Nos.2 to 6, who are the members of the family of appellant No.1 have been living in different cities and have not resided in the matrimonial house of appellant No.1 and respondent No.2 herein. Hence, they cannot be dragged into criminal prosecution and the same would be an abuse of the process of the law in the absence of specific allegations made against each of them.

28. The inclusion of Section 498A of the IPC by way of an amendment was intended to curb cruelty inflicted on a woman by her husband and his family, ensuring swift intervention by the State. However, in recent years, as there have been a notable rise in matrimonial disputes across the country, accompanied by growing discord and tension within the institution of marriage, consequently, there has been a growing tendency to misuse provisions like Section 498A of the IPC as a tool for unleashing personal vendetta against the husband and his family by a wife. Making vague and generalised allegations during matrimonial conflicts, if not scrutinized, will lead to the misuse of legal processes and an encouragement for use of arm twisting tactics by a wife and/or her family. Sometimes, recourse is taken to invoke Section 498A of the IPC against the husband and his family in order to seek compliance with the unreasonable demands of a wife.

Consequently, this Court has, time and again, cautioned against prosecuting the husband and his family in the absence of a clear prima facie case against them.

29. We are not, for a moment, stating that any woman who has suffered cruelty in terms of what has been contemplated under Section 498A of the IPC should remain silent and forbear herself from making a complaint or initiating any criminal proceeding. That is not the intention of our aforesaid observations but we should not encourage a case like as in the present one, where as a counterblast to the petition for dissolution of marriage sought by the first appellant- husband of the second respondent herein, a complaint under Section 498A of the IPC is lodged by the latter. In fact, the insertion of the said provision is meant mainly for the protection of a woman who is subjected to cruelty in the matrimonial home primarily due to an unlawful demand for any property or valuable security in the form of dowry. However, sometimes it is misused as in the present case.

30. In the above context, this Court in G.V. Rao vs. L.H.V. Prasad, (2000) 3 SCC 693 observed as follows:

―12. There has been an outburst of matrimonial disputes in recent times. Marriage is a sacred ceremony, the main purpose of which is to enable the young couple to settle down in life and live peacefully. But little matrimonial skirmishes suddenly erupt which often assume serious proportions resulting in commission of heinous crimes in which elders of the family are also involved with the result that those who could have counselled and brought about rapprochement are rendered helpless on their being arrayed as accused in the criminal case. There are many other reasons which need not be mentioned here for not encouraging matrimonial litigation so that the parties may ponder over their defaults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of fighting it out in a court of law where it takes years and years to conclude and in that process the parties lose their ―young‖ days in chasing their ―cases‖ in different courts.‖
31. Further, this Court in Preeti Gupta vs. State of Jharkhand (2010) 7 SCC 667 held that the courts have to be extremely careful and cautious in dealing with these complaints and must take pragmatic realties into consideration while dealing with matrimonial cases. The allegations of harassment by the husband's close relatives who had been living in different cities and never visited or rarely visited the place where the complainant resided would have an entirely different complexion. The allegations of the complainant are required to be scrutinized with great care and circumspection.

32. We, therefore, are of the opinion that the impugned FIR No.82 of 2022 filed by respondent No.2 was initiated with ulterior motives to settle personal scores and grudges against appellant No.1 and his family members i.e., appellant Nos.2 to 6 herein. Hence, the present case at hand falls within category (7) of illustrative parameters highlighted in Bhajan Lal. Therefore, the High Court, in the present case, erred in not exercising the powers available to it under Section 482 CrPC and thereby failed to prevent abuse of the Court's process by continuing the criminal prosecution against the appellants.‖

9. It appears from the materials in the case diary that the allegations are general in nature and the ingredients to constitute the offences alleged are prima facie not present in respect of the petitioners herein and as such the proceeding is liable to be quashed in the interest of Justice.

10. In the present case, the allegations are vague and general in nature.

11. Thus, there are no prima facie materials (of torture) to proceed against the petitioners herein.

12. CRR 1195 of 2022 with CRR 2232 of 2022 are thus allowed.

13. The proceedings in G.R. Case No. 2275 of 2020 arising out of Bagnan Police Station Case No. 431 of 2020 dated 13.12.2020 under Sections 498A/34 of the Indian Penal Code including Charge Sheet being C.S. No. 205/2021 dated 22.07.2021 pending before the Court of the learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Uluberia, Howrah is hereby quashed in respect of the petitioners namely Indrani Roy and Urmimala Mandal.

14. All connected applications, if any, stands disposed of.

15. Interim order, if any, stands vacated.

16. Copy of this judgment be sent to the learned Trial Court for necessary compliance.

17. Urgent certified website copy of this judgment, if applied for, be supplied expeditiously after complying with all, necessary legal formalities.

                                                             JUDGEMENT
1. This Criminal Appeal is filed, against the judgement of conviction and sentence, dated 06.07.2009, made in SC.No.78 of 2007, by the Sessions Judge, Mahila Court, Chengalpattu, finding the Appellant/ accused guilty for the offences under Sections 498A and 304 of IPC and convicting and sentencing the appellant/accused for the offence under Section 498A of IPC to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year and to pay a fine of Rs.500/-, in default, to undergo three months rigorous imprisonment and for the offence under Section 304 of IPC, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for five years and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/-, in default, to undergo one year simple http://www.judis.nic.in imprisonment and ordering the sentences to run concurrently.

2. The case of the prosecution has arisen on the basis of the statement Ex.P15, dated 21.01.2006, given by the deceased, Jaya @ Jayalalitha, wife of the Appellant/ accused, while she was in the Royapettah Government Hospital, to the Respondent Police. It is alleged in the statement, Ex.P15 that the marriage between the Appellant/accused and her was solemnised on 05.02.1992 and out of the wedlock, they begot two male children and that right from the date of marriage, the appellant/accused used to fight with her, saying that he did not like her and that she should go elsewhere and that on 20.01.2006 at about 7.30 p.m., when the deceased was conversing with PW.1, Kamala, neighbour staying in the ground floor portion, the appellant/accused came there and scolded the victim as to why she was conversing with PW.1 and whether the victim was planning to elope with somebody else and so saying, he went to the house and asked the victim to prepare coffee for him and the deceased questioned him as to why he was quarrelling with her often. It is further stated by the deceased that the appellant/accused told the victim that she was a hindrance to him and so saying, he took the kerosene can and poured the same on her and set her ablaze and that when she raised an alarm, PW.1 came upstairs and enquired the appellant/accused and thereafter, she took the injured victim to a private hospital and came back home. On the next day morning, i.e., on 21.01.2006, with the help of PW.1, the victim was admitted in the Royapettah Government Hospital for further treatment and without responding to the treatment, the victim died on 24.01.2006. After http://www.judis.nic.in investigation, the appellant/accused was charge sheeted for the offences under Sections 498A and 302 of IPC.

3. The case was taken on file in SC.No.78 of 2007, by the Sessions Judge, Mahila Court, Chengalpattu and necessary charges were framed. The accused had denied the charges and sought for trial. In order to bring home the charges against the accused, the Prosecution had examined PW.1 to PW.19 and CW.1 and marked Exs.P1 to P.23 and MOs. 1 to 5. On completion of the evidence on the side of the prosecution, the accused was questioned under Section 313 of Cr.PC as to the incriminating circumstances found in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and the accused has come with the version of total denial and stated that he has been falsely implicated in this case.

4. The Court below, after hearing the arguments advanced on either side and also looking into the materials available on record, found the accused/appellant guilty and awarded punishments as referred to above, which is challenged in this Criminal Appeal.

5. This Court heard the submissions of the learned counsel on either side.

6. The learned counsel for the appellant would submit that the impugned judgement of the court below is based on assumptions, surmises and conjectures and that the Trial Court has failed to see that there was no eye witnesses to implicate the appellant/accused and that the first document, which had come into existence is Ex.P18, accident register, wherein the victim had deposed that she had sustained burn injury due to accidental fire, due to stove burst on 20.01.2006 at 8.00 p.m. and it has been spoken to by http://www.judis.nic.in PW.17 Doctor, who had admitted the victim at the Royapettah Government Hospital and deposed that when he had examined the victim, she was capable of speaking and she was oriented and when that being the first statement, the trial court had erred in convicting the appellant based on an inconsistent dying declaration, which was stated to be recorded by PW.15, Judicial Magistrate.

7. The learned counsel for the Appellant/ accused would further submit that recording of such dying declaration itself is doubtful, since it could not have been recorded as spoken to by PW.15, Judicial Magistrate and that PW.15, in her evidence on oath, had stated that she received the request for recording dying declaration on 23.1.2006 at 5.30 p.m. while she was the VII Metropolitan Magistrate at Chennai and that she had gone to the Royapettah Government Hospital at 5.40 p.m. and on being identified by the Doctor, she recorded her statement.

8. The learned counsel for the Appellant/ accused would further submit that the Judicial Magistrate had also reiterated that the dying declaration was recorded at 6.50 p.m. on 23.01.2006, however taking into consideration Ex.P19, the victim was admitted at Kilpauk government hospital on 23.01.2006 at 4.15 p.m. and thereby the evidence of PW.15 and the dying declaration recorded by her under Ex.P14 are doubtful and that when there is a doubt with regard to the dying declaration recorded by the Judicial Magistrate, the trial Court ought to have relied on the initial statement given by the victim that she had sustained injuries in an accidental fire due to stove burst.

http://www.judis.nic.in

9. The learned counsel for the Appellant/ accused further submit that there is absolutely no material to establish that there was a demand of dowry by the appellant/accused and that the victim was subjected to matrimonial cruelty and that admittedly the marriage between the appellant/accused and the victim took place 15 years prior to the occurrence and that there was absolutely no relationship between the victim and her parental home and that when there is no evidence that the deceased was subjected to matrimonial cruelty, the Trial Court erred in convicting the appellant for the offence under Section 498A of IPC and that PW.6 and PW.7, who are the sons of the Appellant/ accused as well as the victim deceased, have not supported the case of the Prosecution and further PW.1, who is the neighbour has also not spoken about the demand of dowry or matrimonial cruelty.

10.The learned counsel for the Appellant would further submit that according to the Prosecution, the deceased was the author of the First Information Report and the statement of the deceased was said to have been recorded by PW.13, Sub Inspector of Police, in the presence of PW.16 at about 12.00 p.m. on receipt of the information from the Royapettah Government Hospital and thereon, the case was registered in Cr.No.147/2006 and that contrary to the statement, PW.1 in her statement recorded under Section 164 of Cr.PC, has categorically stated that the Police obtained the thumb impression of the deceased in the Royapettah Government Hospital in her presence and thereby falsifying the case of the Prosecution that the signature of the victim deceased was obtained in Ex.P10 and that PW.1 has further categorically stated that the victim was under the influence of medicine and under http://www.judis.nic.in unconscious state of mind when the statement was recorded and her thumb impression was obtained and thereby falsifying the case of the Prosecution. He would further submit that the statement was recorded from the victim deceased when she was not in good conscious of mind and thereby creating a doubt about the certification made by PW.16 Doctor, in the statement and that non examination of the brother of the deceased victim, one Murthy, who had admitted her in the Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital and the non examination of the mother of the deceased victim and the uncle of the victim deceased, who was stated to be all along with her, from 21.06.2006 to 24.01.2006 till the date of her death creates a grave doubt with regard to the case of the Prosecution and that the Prosecution has attempted to suppress this evidence and thereby creating a grave doubt in the case of the Prosecution.

11.Per contra, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor would submit that though in Ex.P18, the victim deceased is said to have informed the Doctor that she sustained burn injuries due to an accidental fire by stove burst, it has been categorically explained by PW.1, who had stated that she had given such a statement to protect her husband and thereafter, a statement had been recorded from the victim deceased by PW.13 in the presence of PW.16 Doctor, who had certified that the victim/deceased was conscious at the time of giving the said statement and thereafter, the Prosecution had given a requisition to the Judicial Magistrate to record the dying declaration on 23.01.2006, based on which, the Judicial Magistrate, PW.15 had recorded the dying declaration in the presence of PW.16, Dr.Rossy and that http://www.judis.nic.in in the dying declaration, she has stated that there were frequent fights between her and her husband and that on Friday, at around 6.00 p.m. there was a fight between them, pursuant to which, saying that she is going to die, she had taken kerosene can in the house and at that time, the Appellant/ accused told that he himself do that and saying that she is useless, he poured kerosene on her and set fire on her and that the dying declaration was recorded by PW.15 and that PW.16 has also certified prior to recording of the statement and also after conclusion of recording the statement. He would further submit that PW.18 has also stated that the victim was admitted on 23.1.2006 at 4.15 p.m and that during her treatment, she had stated that on examination, the patient was found to be conscious and that the minor discrepancies with regard to the time will not affect the case of the Prosecution, since the Doctor has certified with regard to the consciousness of the victim and the statement has been recorded by a Judicial Magistrate.

12.I have given my careful and anxious consideration to the rival contentions put forward by either side and thoroughly scanned through the entire evidence available on record and also perused the impugned judgement of conviction.

13.The points that arise for consideration are as to whether the Prosecution has proved its case beyond all reasonable doubts and whether the Prosecution is justified in convicting and sentencing the Appellant/ accused for the offence under Sections 498A and 304 of IPC, as stated above.

14.The marriage took place between the Appellant/ accused and the deceased on 5.2.1992. The date of occurrence is 20.01.2006 at about 7.00 p.m. i.e. http://www.judis.nic.in after 14 years of the marriage. The deceased died on 24.1.2006 at 7.50 a.m.

17.PW.1, Kamala, neighbour, had deposed that there were frequent quarrels between the deceased and the Appellant/ accused and that the deceased used to tell the same to her and that on the day of occurrence, there was a quarrel between them and that a five litre kerosene was in the house of the deceased and that on hearing the alarm of the deceased, she went upstairs and saw the deceased burning and that the Appellant/ accused had told her that stove was burst and that the deceased was taken to the Private Hospital and after treatment, they came back and that she had given false statement that stove war burst only to protect her husband. She had further deposed that in the Government Hospital at Royapettah, the deceased had told that her husband only set fire on her, by pouring kerosene.

18.Though as per Ex.P18, the victim was alleged to have stated that she had sustained injuries due to accidental fire due to stove burst, the reason for giving such a statement has been explained by PW.1, who had admitted her in the Hospital. Further, in the statement recorded from the victim by PW.13 in Ex.P10, the victim has spoken about the occurrence. Further, in the dying declaration also, the victim has implicated him.

19.In order to attract the provisions of Section 498A of IPC, the cruelty or harassment meted out to the wife by her husband or relatives of her husband should be to the extent that it became unbearable. Thus, the essential ingredients of Section 498A of IPC are (1) a woman must be married, (2) she must be subjected to cruelty and (3) cruelty must be of the nature of harassment of such woman, with a view to coerce her to meet unlawful http://www.judis.nic.in demand for property or valuable security.

20.On analysis of the entire evidence, this Court is able to see that the Prosecution has not let in evidence to prove the charges under Section 498A of IPC. In other words, this Court is of the view that the Prosecution has not let in sufficient evidence to show that the Appellant/ accused had subjected the deceased/victim-his wife to cruelty, which was of such a nature as was likely to drive the victim to commit suicide or cause grave injury or danger to her life, limb or health, thereby satisfying the requirements of section 498A IPC. Therefore, the conviction and sentence imposed on the Appellant/ accused under Section 498A of IPC is to be set aside.

21.Admittedly, the victim and the Appellant/ accused got married about 14 years prior to the occurrence and there was no relationship between the parental home of the deceased victim and her. Further, the evidence of PW.1 is also not in categoric terms as to the demand of dowry or matrimonial cruelty committed on the victim deceased. However, this Court is able to see that there was a quarrel between the spouses and that the victim deceased had herself brought the kerosene can and told him that she is going to die and at that time, the Appellant/ accused, saying that he himself kill her, poured kerosene on her and set fire on her. The Trial Court relying on the dying declaration has rendered a finding that there was a quarrel and during such a quarrel, the Appellant/ accused called her as useless person and thereby, the victim herself had gone into the house and brought the kerosene can and threatened to immolate herself and at that time, the Appellant had, in the spur of the moment, told that he himself will do that and thereby, out of http://www.judis.nic.in sudden aggravation and provocation, he had done the act and thereby, the Trial Court, finding that there was no intention, had rightly convicted the Appellant/ accused for the offence under Section 304 of IPC, which warrants no interference by this Court.

22.Now coming to the question of sentence, the learned counsel for the Appellant/Accused would submit that in this case, the two sons of the deceased, who are stated to have been present at the time of occurrence and who have been examined as PW.7 and PW.8, have stated that their mother had committed suicide and they have not supported the case of the Prosecution. Further, they have been brought up by the Appellant and that after the occurrence, the Appellant had suffered incarceration during investigation and after conviction and that the occurrence had taken place during the year 2006 and more than thirteen years have lapsed and that the mitigating circumstances can be considered for reduction of sentence. Taking into consideration the mitigating circumstances that 13 years have passed, the conviction and sentence imposed on the Appellant/ accused under Section 304 of IPC can be modified from five years to one year Rigorous Imprisonment.

23.In the result, this Criminal Appeal is partly allowed. The Appellant is acquitted from the charges levelled against him for the offence under Section 498A of IPC alone. The fine amount, if any, paid by the Appellant for the offence under Section 498A of IPC is directed to be refunded to him. However, in so far as the conviction and sentence imposed on the Appellant/ accused under Section 304 of IPC is concerned, the conviction and sentence http://www.judis.nic.in imposed on the Appellant/ accused is modified from five years Rigorous Imprisonment to one year Rigorous Imprisonment and the fine amount with default sentence imposed for the offence under Section 304 of IPC shall stand unaltered.The Appellant/Accused is on bail and the bail bond executed by him shall stand cancelled. The Trial Court concerned shall take necessary steps to secure the presence of the Appellant/Accused to undergo the remaining period of sentence.

Muhammed Hussain vs State Of Kerala,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/179136420/,"Kerala High Court
Muhammed Hussain vs State Of Kerala on 8 January, 2025
B.S.Joshi and Others v. State of Haryana and another [(2003) 4 SCC 675] held that the offence under Section 498A can be quashed by the High Court exercising its inherent power under Section 482 Cr.P.C (now Section 528 of BNSS, 2023), though such offence is not compoundable under Section 320. Relying on State of Karnataka v. L. Muniswamy [(1977) 2 SCC 699], a two Judges Bench in B.S. Joshi (Supra) held that ends of justice are higher than ends of mere law, though justice has got to be administered according to laws made by legislature. The fact that there is no reasonable likelihood of conviction, in the wake of settlement between the parties, was taken stock of. The following findings in B.S.Joshi (supra) are relevant and extracted here below:

""What would happen to the trial of the case where the wife does not support the imputations made in the FIR of the type in question. As earlier noticed, now she has filed an affidavit that the 2025:KER:1056 FIR was registered at her instance due to temperamental differences and implied imputations. There may be many reasons for not supporting the imputations. It may be either for the reason that she has resolved disputes with her husband and his other family members and as a result thereof she has again started living with her husband, with whom she earlier had differences or she has willingly parted company and is living happily on her own or has married someone else on the earlier marriage having been dissolved by divorce on consent of parties or fails to support the prosecution on some other similar grounds. In such eventuality, there would almost be no chance of conviction. Would it then be proper to decline to exercise power of quashing on the ground that it would be permitting the parties to compound non- compoundable offences? The answer clearly has to be in the ""negative"". It would, however, be a different matter if the High Court on facts declines the prayer for quashing for any valid reasons including lack of bona fides.""
2. The dictum laid down in B.S.Joshi (supra) was doubted along with that laid down in other cases and referred to and considered by a three Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303]. B.S.Joshi (supra), along with other cases, were 2025:KER:1056 confirmed by the Supreme Court. It is relevant to note that the subject matter in B.S.Joshi (supra) was specifically with reference to the offences under Section 498A and 406 of the Indian Penal Code.


3. In the facts at hand, petitioner is the sole accused in Crime No.451/2024 of Panangad Police Station, Ernakulam, now pending as C.C.No.861/2024 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-VIII, Ernakulam. As per the final report, the offence alleged is under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. The petitioner seeks quashment of entire proceedings in the above Calendar Case, on the strength of the settlement arrived at by and between the parties.

4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, learned counsel for the 3rd respondent/defacto complainant and the learned Senior Public Prosecutor. Perused the records.

5. When this Crl.M.C was moved, this Court directed to record the statement of the defacto complainant. The said direction was complied and the statement was handed over. On perusal of the same, it is clear that the issues between the 2025:KER:1056 petitioner and the defacto complainant are settled. She has no objection in quashing the criminal proceedings against the petitioner. That apart, it is noticed that, along with this Crl.M.C, an affidavit has been sworn to by the defacto complainant (3rd respondent herein) as Annexure-A3, wherein she would unequivocally state that the disputes have been settled and they were separated on the basis of Mubarath agreement. The defacto complainant would also swear that she has no grievance against the petitioner and that the affidavit is sworn to on her own volition, without any compulsion, whatsoever. This Court, is therefore, convinced that the settlement arrived at is genuine and bonafide. Learned Counsel for the 3 rd respondent/defacto complainant would also endorse that the quashment sought for can be allowed.


6. In the light of the above referred facts, this Court is of the opinion that the necessary parameters, as culled out in B.S.Joshi (supra) and Gian Singh (Supra), are fully satisfied. This court is convinced that further proceedings against the petitioner will be a futile exercise, inasmuch 2025:KER:1056 as the disputes have already been settled. There is little possibility of any conviction in the crime. Dehors the settlement arrived at by and between the parties, if they are compelled to face the criminal proceedings, the same, in the estimation of this Court, will amount to abuse of process of Court. The quashment sought for would secure the ends of justice.

In the circumstances, this Crl.M.C. is allowed. Annexure A1 FIR in Crime No.451/2024, Annexure II Final Report and all further proceedings in C.C.No.861/2024 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-VIII, Ernakulam are hereby quashed.

ORDER
The present Criminal Revision is directed against the order passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Mahalir Neethimandram, Coimbatore in CMP.No.645 of 2015 in SC.No.248 of 2015 dated 18.03.2016 allowing the discharge petition filed by the A4/present petitioner from the charges.

2.The learned counsel for the petitioner would contend that in this case, the trial Court without analysing the entire evidence discharged A4, as if there is no incriminating materials available for framing of charges against him. The trial Court without analysing the evidences of LW1 to LW3 have categorically implicated the accused and there was a specific allegations found in the Section 161 statement of the above witnesses. The trial Court compiling with the evidence of LW1 to LW3 with the evidence before the Revenue Divisional Magistrate, erroneously discharged A4 from the offences. The trial Court failed to look into sections 304B r/w.113-B of Indian Evidence Act, which presume the guilt of committing the offence of dowry death by any person who has been proved to have subjected a married women concerned soon before her death to cruelty or harassment, for or in connection with dowry. The learned counsel further contended that there are sufficient materials available on the side of the prosecution to frame charges against A4, but the trial Court without appreciating the evidence wrongly compared with the other evidence and analysing the evidence at the stage of framing charges itself comes to a conclusion. In view of the above, the trial Court has erroneously discharged the accused from the charges and the learned counsel prays this Court to allow the criminal revision by setting aside the order of discharge passed by the trial Court against A4.

3.The learned counsel for the first respondent/A4 vehemently contended that the trial Court after perusing the entire evidences produced on the side of the prosecution correctly come to a conclusion that there is no valid incriminating materials available against A4, on the side of prosecution. Hence, the trial Court clearly discharged A4 from the charges and there is no illegality or infirmity in the order passed by the trial Court and prays to dismiss the revision petition.

4.Heard the rival submissions made on both sides and perused the records.

5.The learned counsel for the petitioner during the course of arguments produced the following citations in support of his contentions :-

1.(2013) 11 SCC 476  Sheoraj Singh Ahlwat and another V. State of Uttar Pradesh and another
2.(2014) 2 SCC 240  Tummala Venkateswar Rao V. State of Andhra Pradesh
3.(2014) 11 SCC 709 State of Tamil Nadu V. N.Suresh Rajan and others
6.It is held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in paragraph 21 of the first decision reported in (2013) 11 SCC 476  Sheoraj Singh Ahlwat and another V. State of Uttar Pradesh and another 21. Coming then to the case at hand, the allegations made against the appellants are specific not only against the husband but also against the parents-in-law of the complainant wife. Whether or not those allegations are true is a matter which cannot be determined at the stage of framing of charges. Any such determination can take place only at the conclusion of the trial. This may at times put an innocent party, falsely accused of commission of an offence to avoidable harassment but so long as the legal requirement and the settled principles do not permit a discharge the court would find it difficult to do much, conceding that legal process at times is abused by unscrupulous litigants especially in matrimonial cases where the tendency has been to involve as many members of the family of the opposite party as possible. While such tendency needs to be curbed, the court will not be able to speculate whether the allegations made against the accused are true or false at the preliminary stage to be able to direct a discharge. Two of the appellants in this case happen to be the parents-in-law of the complainant who are senior citizens. Appellant 1 who happens to be the father-in-law of the complainant wife has been a Major General, by all means, a respectable position in the Army. But the nature of the allegations made against the couple and those against the husband, appear to be much too specific to be ignored at least at the stage of framing of charges. The courts below, therefore, did not commit any mistake in refusing a discharge.

7.The Apex Court in the second judgment report in (2014) 2 SCC 240  Tummala Venkateswar Rao V. State of Andhra Pradesh observed in paragraphs 8, 9, 10 and 14 are as follows :-

8. This Court in Kailash v. State of M.P. has observed as under: (SCC pp. 670-71, para 10) 10. No presumption under Section 113-B of the Evidence Act would be drawn against the accused if it is shown that after the alleged demand, cruelty or harassment the dispute stood resolved and there was no evidence of cruelty or harassment thereafter. Mere lapse of some time by itself would not provide to an accused a defence, if the course of conduct relating to cruelty or harassment in connection with the dowry demand is shown to have existed earlier in time not too late and not too stale before the date of death of the victim. This is so because the expression used in the relevant provision is soon before. The expression is a relative term which is required to be considered under specific circumstances of each case and no straitjacket formula can be laid down by fixing any time-limit. The expression is pregnant with the idea of proximity test. It cannot be said that the term soon before is synonymous with the term immediately before. This is because of what is stated in Section 114 Illustration (a) of the Evidence Act. The determination of the period which can come within the term soon before is left to be determined by the courts, depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Suffice, however, to indicate that the expression soon before would normally imply that the interval should not be much between the cruelty or harassment concerned and the death in question. There must be existence of a proximate and live link [see Hira Lal v. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi)].

9. This Court in Hira Lal v. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) has observed as under: (SCC pp. 86-87, para 9) 9. A conjoint reading of Section 113-B of the Evidence Act and Section 304-B IPC shows that there must be material to show that soon before her death the victim was subjected to cruelty or harassment. The prosecution has to rule out the possibility of a natural or accidental death so as to bring it within the purview of death occurring otherwise than in normal circumstances. The expression soon before is very relevant where Section 113-B of the Evidence Act and Section 304-B IPC are pressed into service. The prosecution is obliged to show that soon before the occurrence there was cruelty or harassment and only in that case presumption operates. Evidence in that regard has to be led by the prosecution. Soon before is a relative term and it would depend upon the circumstances of each case and no straitjacket formula can be laid down as to what would constitute a period of soon before the occurrence. It would be hazardous to indicate any fixed period, and that brings in the importance of a proximity test both for the proof of an offence of dowry death as well as for raising a presumption under Section 113-B of the Evidence Act. The expression soon before her death used in the substantive Section 304-B IPC and Section 113-B of the Evidence Act is present with the idea of proximity test. No definite period has been indicated and the expression soon before is not defined. A reference to the expression soon before used in Section 114 Illustration (a) of the Evidence Act is relevant. It lays down that a court may presume that a man who is in the possession of goods soon after the theft, is either the thief or has received the goods knowing them to be stolen, unless he can account for their possession. The determination of the period which can come within the term soon before is left to be determined by the courts, depending upon facts and circumstances of each case. Suffice, however, to indicate that the expression soon before would normally imply that the interval should not be much between the cruelty or harassment concerned and the death in question. There must be existence of a proximate and live link between the effect of cruelty based on dowry demand and the death concerned. If the alleged incident of cruelty is remote in time and has become stale enough not to disturb the mental equilibrium of the woman concerned, it would be of no consequence.

10. Section 304-B IPC reads as follows:

304-B. Dowry death.(1) Where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called dowry death, and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death.
Explanation.For the purpose of this sub-section, dowry shall have the same meaning as in Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (28 of 1961).
(2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than seven years but which may extend to imprisonment for life. It is obvious from this provision that the term soon before her death has been employed by Parliament to refer to cruelty or harassment which was meted out in proximity to the death and has to be considered as the cause of the death as held supra. The provision does not employ the term at any time before nor immediately before and must be construed according to its true import.
14. It may be noted, no exculpatory evidence has been led in defence so as to rebut the presumption enacted by Section 113-B of the Evidence Act, 1872, which reads as follows:

113-B. Presumption as to dowry death.When the question is whether a person has committed the dowry death of a woman and it is shown that soon before her death such woman had been subjected by such person to cruelty or harassment for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, the court shall presume that such person had caused the dowry death.
Explanation.For the purpose of this section, dowry death shall have the same meaning as in Section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).
8.The Apex Court in the third judgment reported in (2014) 11 SCC 709 State of Tamil Nadu V. N.Suresh Rajan and others observed in paragraphs 29 to 31.3 are extracted hereunder :-
29. We have bestowed our consideration to the rival submissions and the submissions made by Mr Ranjit Kumar commend us. True it is that at the time of consideration of the applications for discharge, the court cannot act as a mouthpiece of the prosecution or act as a post office and may sift evidence in order to find out whether or not the allegations made are groundless so as to pass an order of discharge. It is trite that at the stage of consideration of an application for discharge, the court has to proceed with an assumption that the materials brought on record by the prosecution are true and evaluate the said materials and documents with a view to find out whether the facts emerging therefrom taken at their face value disclose the existence of all the ingredients constituting the alleged offence. At this stage, probative value of the materials has to be gone into and the court is not expected to go deep into the matter and hold that the materials would not warrant a conviction. In our opinion, what needs to be considered is whether there is a ground for presuming that the offence has been committed and not whether a ground for convicting the accused has been made out. To put it differently, if the court thinks that the accused might have committed the offence on the basis of the materials on record on its probative value, it can frame the charge; though for conviction, the court has to come to the conclusion that the accused has committed the offence. The law does not permit a mini trial at this stage.
30. Reference in this connection can be made to a recent decision of this Court in Sheoraj Singh Ahlawat v. State of U.P., in which, after analysing various decisions on the point, this Court endorsed the following view taken in Onkar Nath Mishra v. State (NCT of Delhi): (Sheoraj Singh Ahlawat case, SCC p. 482, para 15)
15. 11. It is trite that at the stage of framing of charge the court is required to evaluate the material and documents on record with a view to finding out if the facts emerging therefrom, taken at their face value, disclosed the existence of all the ingredients constituting the alleged offence. At that stage, the court is not expected to go deep into the probative value of the material on record. What needs to be considered is whether there is a ground for presuming that the offence has been committed and not a ground for convicting the accused has been made out. At that stage, even strong suspicion founded on material which leads the court to form a presumptive opinion as to the existence of the factual ingredients constituting the offence alleged would justify the framing of charge against the accused in respect of the commission of that offence. (Onkar Nath case, SCC p. 565, para 11) (emphasis in original)

31. Now reverting to the decisions of this Court in Sajjan Kumar and Dilawar Balu Kurane, relied on by the respondents, we are of the opinion that they do not advance their case. The aforesaid decisions consider the provision of Section 227 of the Code and make it clear that at the stage of discharge the court cannot make a roving enquiry into the pros and cons of the matter and weigh the evidence as if it was conducting a trial. It is worth mentioning that the Code contemplates discharge of the accused by the Court of Session under Section 227 in a case triable by it; cases instituted upon a police report are covered by Section 239 and cases instituted otherwise than on a police report are dealt with in Section 245. From a reading of the aforesaid sections it is evident that they contain somewhat different provisions with regard to discharge of an accused:

31.1. Under Section 227 of the Code, the trial court is required to discharge the accused if it considers that there is not sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. However, discharge under Section 239 can be ordered when the Magistrate considers the charge against the accused to be groundless. The power to discharge is exercisable under Section 245(1) when, the Magistrate considers, for reasons to be recorded that no case against the accused has been made out which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction.
31.2. Section 227 and 239 provide for discharge before the recording of evidence on the basis of the police report, the documents sent along with it and examination of the accused after giving an opportunity to the parties to be heard. However, the stage of discharge under Section 245, on the other hand, is reached only after the evidence referred in Section 244 has been taken.
31.3. Thus, there is difference in the language employed in these provisions. But, in our opinion, notwithstanding these differences, and whichever provision may be applicable, the court is required at this stage to see that there is a prima facie case for proceeding against the accused. Reference in this connection can be made to a judgment of this Court in R.S. Nayak v. A.R. Antulay. The same reads as follows: (SCC pp. 755-56, para 43) 43.  Notwithstanding this difference in the position there is no scope for doubt that the stage at which the Magistrate is required to consider the question of framing of charge under Section 245(1) is a preliminary one and the test of prima facie case has to be applied. In spite of the difference in the language of the three sections, the legal position is that if the trial court is satisfied that a prima facie case is made out, charge has to be framed.
9.On perusal of the above said judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court produced on the side of the petitioner, it is settled principles of law that at the time of framing charges, the Court has to analyse whether any materials available to show that prima facie case for proceedings against the accused is available or not, the Court cannot compare with the other statement and compare and analyse whether the evidence has to be believed or not, whether any contradiction in the other evidence or statement by the accused, framing of charge is not the stage to look into other material and analyse the evidence, whether it is genuine or not and to compare with the evidence with other materials etc., The Court has to peruse whether any prima facie material available to frame charges.
10.In this case, on reading of the entire evidence of witnesses, it is clear and specifically stated that there are incriminating material available to frame charges under Section 498A IPC. Even though the first respondent has come the house of the deceased weekly once from Bangalore on Saturday and Sunday, there is specific evidence available to presume that he has committed offence under Section 498A IPC, hence, there is incriminating materials are available to frame charge under Section 498A IPC. Whether the evidence of LW1 to LW4 has to be believed or not, the statement before the Executive Magistrate has to be taken into consideration or not cannot be decided at the present stage. All the other defences has to be raised only at the time of trial. This Court finds considerable incriminating materials available to frame charges against A4 under Section 498A IPC.
11.At this juncture, the learned counsel for the petitioner invited the provisions of Section 113 B of Indian Evidence Act, which reads as follows :-
113B. Presumption as to dowry death - When the question is whether a person has committed the dowry death of a woman and it is shown that soon before her death such woman had been subjected by such person to cruelty or harassment for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, the court shall presume that such person had caused the dowry death.
12.On reading of the above section 113 B of Indian Evidence Act, r/w.304B IPC, incriminating materials are available to frame charges against A4 under Section 498A IPC. This Court is of the view that sufficient incriminating materials under Section 304 B is also available for framing charges against A4.
13.This Court is of the considered view, the order of the learned Sessions Judge, Magalir Neethimandram (Mahila Court), Coimbatore in considering the evidences of LW1 to LW3 and came to the conclusion that there is no sufficient materials available is erroneous at this point of time to frame charge against A4. Hence, the order of the lower Court in discharging the A4 is liable to be set aside and the same is hereby set aside.
14.In the result, the criminal revision is allowed by setting aside the order passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Mahalir Neethimanram, Coimbatore made in CMP.No.645 of 2007 in SC.No.248 of 2015 dated 18.03.2016. The matter is remitted back to the file of learned Sessions Judge, Mahalir Neethimanram, Coimbatore, the lower Court is directed to frame charges against A4 for the offences under Sections 498 A and 304 B IPC and proceed with the trial in accordance with law. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed.

Abhishek And 5 Others vs State Of U.P. And Another on 8 January, 2025
1. Heard Sri Manoj Pandey, leaned Advocate holding brief of Sri Prakash Tripathi, learned counsel for the applicants, Sri Mayank Awasthi, learned Brief Holder for the State, Sri Manoj Pandey, learned counsel for opposite party no. 2 and perused the record.

2. This application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. has been filed by the applicants challenging charge sheet dated 31.01.2024 and cognizance order dated 12.02.2024 and proceedings of Case No. 8412 of 2024 (CNR No. UPMO04011254-2024) State v. Abhishek and others, arising out of Case Crime No. 378 of 2023, under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506, 325 IPC and under Sections 3/4 D.P. Act, Police Station Pakbada, District Moradabad pending before the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate-2, Moradabad.

3. Brief facts of the case are that a first information report has been lodged by opposite party no. 2 ? Mahendi Devi on 28.11.2023 at 13:55 hrs. bearing Case Crime No. 378 of 2023, under Sections 498-A, 323, 504, 506 IPC and 3/4 D.P. Act, against six persons who are the applicants herein with the allegation that marriage of daughter of opposite party no. 2 was solemnized with Abhishek ? applicant no. 1 on 08.12.2021 according to Hindu rites and rituals. About Rs. 15 Lakh were spent in the aforesaid marriage. Out of the wedlock, a girl child was born on 03.02.2023. The applicant mentally and physically tortured daughter of opposite party no.2 raising additional dowry demand. On 29.09.2023 when son of O.P. No. 2, namely, Jay Kishan had gone to place of the applicants for vidai of his sister Anita, he saw all the applicants assaulting his sister. He was also pushed and forced to leave the house. The O.P. No. 2 moved an application on 03.10.2023 before the S.S.P., Moradabad whereafter on 20.10.2023 compromise took place in Mahila Thana, Moradabad and Abhishek took Anita along with him. Despite the said compromise in Mahila Thana, Moradabad, the applicants did not change their conduct and demanded one car and five lakh rupees and also assaulted daughter of O.P. No. 2 for the same. On 27.11.2023 Anita called her brother informing him on telephone that husband Abhishek, father-in-law Pan Singh, mother-in-law Neelam, Nanad Rakhi and father of Jethani Ram Awtar all badly beaten her. They also threatened her for burning her to death. She locked herself in the house. On receiving the aforesaid information, brother Jay Kishan reached the place of her in-laws, he was also abused and beaten by all the applicants and neighbours managed to save him and Anita. They with great difficulty managed to leave the house and the present FIR was lodged. After investigation chargesheet has been submitted against the applicants under the relevant sections.

4. Learned counsel for the applicants submits that the present case has been lodged with false and frivolous allegations. It is highly improbable that father of jethani would raise any dowry demand and assault the daughter of O.P. No. 2 for the same. No such dowry demand was made by any of the applicants. Omnibus, general, vague and bald allegations have been levelled against all the applicants. Several other submissions have been made on behalf of the applicants to demonstrate falsity of the allegations made against them. Allegations as levelled against the applicants are false hence the proceedings may be quashed.

5. Learned A.G.A. on the other hand submits that from the version of FIR as well as statements of chargesheet witnesses as well as of the victim Anita, it is clear that she was abused, mentally and physically tortured and badly beaten by all the applicants, due to which she sustained injuries. The medical report as annexed at Page-35 of the petition shows that she sustained three injuries and injury no. 2 is grievous in nature. It is next contended that there are specific allegations against all the applicants. He further submits that all the contentions raised by the applicants' counsel relate to disputed questions of fact. On the basis of material on record after conducting of statutory investigation under Chapter XII Cr.P.C. by the investigating officer, a strong prima facie case is made out against the applicant for the commission of the alleged incident.

6. I have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the records of the present application.

7. This Court finds that the submissions made by the applicants' learned counsel call for adjudication on pure questions of fact which may adequately be adjudicated upon only by the trial court and while doing so even the submissions made on points of law can also be more appropriately gone into by the trial court in this case. The issue whether it is appropriate for this Court being the highest Court to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash the charge-sheet and the proceedings at the stage when the Magistrate has merely issued process against the applicant and trial is yet to come only on the submission made by the learned counsel for the applicant that present criminal case initiated by opposite party no.2 are not only malicious but also abuse of process of law has elaborately been discussed by the Apex Court in the following judgments:-

(i) R.P. Kapur Versus State of Punjab; AIR 1960 SC 866,
(ii) State of Haryana & Ors. Versus Ch. Bhajan Lal & Ors.;1992 Supp.(1) SCC 335,
(iii) State of Bihar & Anr. Versus P.P. Sharma & Anr.; 1992 Supp (1) SCC 222,
(iv) Zandu Pharmaceuticals Works Ltd. & Ors. Versus Mohammad Shariful Haque & Anr.; 2005 (1) SCC 122,
(v) M. N. Ojha Vs. Alok Kumar Srivastava; 2009 (9) SCC 682,
(vi) Mohd. Allauddin Khan Vs. The State of Bihar & Others; 2019 0 Supreme (SC) 454,
(vii) Nallapareddy Sridhar Reddy Vs. The State of Andhra Pradesh & Ors.; 2020 0 Supreme (SC) 45, and laslty
(viii) Rajeev Kaurav Vs. Balasahab & Others; 2020 0 Supreme (SC) 143.
8. In view of the aforesaid, this Court does not deem it proper, and therefore cannot be persuaded to have a pre-trial before the actual trial begins. A threadbare discussion of various facts and circumstances, as they emerge from the allegations made against the accused, is being purposely avoided by the Court for the reason, lest the same might cause any prejudice to either side during trial. But it shall suffice to observe that the perusal of the F.I.R. and the material collected by the Investigating Officer on the basis of which the charge sheet has been submitted makes out a prima facie case against the accused at this stage and there appear to be sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. I do not find any justification to quash the charge sheet or the proceedings against the applicants arising out of them as the case does not fall in any of the categories recognized by the Apex Court which may justify their quashing.

9. The prayer for quashing the impugned charge-sheet dated 31.01.2024 and cognizance order dated 12.02.2024 as well as the entire proceedings of the aforesaid case are refused, as I do not see any abuse of the court's process at this pre-trial stage.

10. The present application has no merit and is, accordingly, rejected.

2.The case of the prosecution is as follows:

(i) On the side of the prosecution, P.W.1 to P.W.10 were examined and Exs.P1 to P9 and M.O.1 to M.O.17 were marked.
(ii)P.W.2/Nirmala is the mother of deceased Kowsalya and mother-in-law of accused. P.W.1/Sambandham is brother of P.W.2. On 23.09.1999, marriage was performed between the deceased Kowsalya and accused. During marriage, 10 sovereign jewels, Rs.20,000/- and sridhana worth about Rs.30,000/- were given to the accused. After marriage only, P.W.1 and P.W.2 came to know that the accused is having the habits of alcohol and gambling. After marriage, both the accused and Kowsalya were living happily for one year. Thereafter, the accused demanded money, for which, he often sent Kowsalya to her parental home. On 07.04.2001, the accused went to the house of P.W.2 and demanded a sum of Rs.20,000/- for buying motor cycle. At that time, P.W.2 said that she is not having amount and after getting chit amount within two weeks, she would give the amount. On 11.04.2001, P.W.1 came to know that since Kowsalya refused to give money to her husband/accused for consuming alcohol, the accused snatched her thali and after taking < sovereign gold coin, he threw away the thali and then, he hanged Kowsalya and ran away from his house. On 11.04.2001, at about 9.00 p.m., while P.W.1 was in his house, people belonging to the native place of accused came there and intimated that Kowsalya committed suicide by hanging. Since there is no bus facility during night hours, P.W.1 went to the house of Kowsalya on 12.04.2001 at about 4.00 a.m. After seeing the body of deceased Kowsalya, P.W.1 went to Kavarapettai police station and lodged a complaint Ex.P1.
(iii) P.W.9/Thirunavukkarasu, who is the Sub-Inspector of Police in Kavarapettai police station, received Ex.P1 complaint from P.W.1 and registered a case in Crime No.172 of 2001 under Section 174(3)Cr.P.C. and prepared Ex.P6 First Information Report. Then he sent Ex.P6/FIR to P.W.8/R.D.O. and copy of F.I.R. to Superintendent of Police, Ponneri.
(iv) On 12.04.2001, P.W.10/Soundararajan, Superintendent of Police, Ponneri, received Ex.P6/F.I.R. at 1.00 p.m. and went to the place of occurrence at 1.45 p.m. and prepared Ex.P2 observation mahazar in the presence of the witnesses namely, P.W.6/Nathan and one Mari and drew rough sketch Ex.P7. At 3.00 p.m., P.W.10 seized M.O.1/gold thali, M.O.2/thali pottu, M.O.3 series/gold nanal tubes five in numbers, M.O.4 series/gold balls three in numbers, M.O.5/brass tube one in number, M.O.12/broken glass pieces, M.O.13/broken bangle pieces, M.O.14/green colour nylon rope, M.O.15/green colour nylon rope which was tied in the middle and M.O.16/yellow colour thali under Ex.P3 seizure mahazar.

Then he examined the witnesses and recorded their statements.
(v) On 12.04.2001, P.W.8/Revenue Divisional Officer went to the place of occurrence and conducted inquest in the presence of the Panchayatars and relatives of deceased Kowsalya and recorded their statements. Then he sent requisition to the Government Hospital, Ponneri for conducting post-mortem. He gave Ex.P5/inquest report stating that the death of Kowsalya is not due to dowry demand.
(vi) On 13.04.2001, P.W.10 sent the body of deceased Kowsalya for conducting post-mortem through Mohan/Police. Then he seized M.O.6/yellow thread with manjal (turmeric), M.O.7/kunguma colour saree, M.O.8/teared sandal colour blouse, M.O.9/sandal colour bra, M.O.10/sandal colour skirt and M.O.11/teared green colour inskirt through Form No.95 Ex.P8.
(vii) On 13.04.2001, at about 1.10 p.m., P.W.7/Dr.Gopinath, Ponneri Government Hospital, conducted post-mortem on the body of deceased Kowsalya and gave Ex.P4/Post-mortem certificate and opined that the death of Kowsalya is due to asphyxia by hanging.
(viii) On 29.05.2001, P.W.10 altered the Section from 174(3) Cr.P.C. to Sections 306 and 498A IPC and sent Ex.P9 alteration report to the Judicial magistrate. At 3.00 p.m., he arrested the accused in Thachur cross-cut road and sent him to judicial custody.
(ix) On 27.08.2001, P.W.10 examined the other witnesses and recorded their statements. On 02.09.2001, after completing investigation, filed a charge sheet against the accused for offences under Sections 498A, 306 and 304B IPC.
3.The Trial Court placed the incriminating evidence before the accused persons under Section 313(1)(b) of Cr.P.C. and the accused denied the same in toto. On the side of the defence, no oral and documentary evidence were let in. After considering the oral and documentary evidence on the side of the prosecution, the trial Court convicted and sentenced the accused as stated above.

4.Challenging the conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court, the learned counsel for the appellant/accused raised the following points:

(i) The trial Court failed to consider the evidence of P.W.1 and P.W.2, who are giving contradictory version in respect of demanding amount by the accused soon before death of Kowsalya. So the offence under Section 304(B) IPC is not made out.
(ii) The trial Court convicted the appellant/accused not only for offence under Section 304(B) IPC and he was also convicted for offence under Section 306 IPC. The ingredients of Sections 304B and 306 IPC are entirely different, but the trial Court without considering the same, has wrongly convicted the accused for both the offences under Sections 304B and 306 IPC.
(iii) The evidence of P.W.3 and P.W.4 are not supported the case of prosecution for demand of dowry.
(iv) P.W.8/R.D.O. gave Ex.P5 inquest report, in which, it was stated that death of Kowsalya is not due to dowry demand. The appellant neither made her cruelty nor abated her for commission of suicide.
The trial Court without considering the above aspects erroneously convicted the accused for the aforesaid offences and hence, he prayed for allowing the appeal.

5.Resisting the same, learned Government Advocate (Crl.side) submits that it is true, no person can be convicted for both the offences under Sections 304(B) and 306 IPC. However, ingredients of Section 306 IPC are made out by examining P.W.3 and P.W.4, who are neighbours of deceased Kowsalya. According to their evidence, Kowsalya was subjected to cruelty in the hands of the accused. So the offence under Section 498A IPC has also been made out and the same was proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. It is further submitted that the trial Court considering all the aspects in proper perspective, rightly convicted the appellant/accused and therefore, he prayed for dismissal of the appeal.

6.Considered the rival submissions made on both sides and perused the materials available on record.

7.The marriage between the appellant/accused and deceased Kowsalya was performed on 23.09.1999. The alleged occurrence was said to have taken place on 11.04.2001. The said Kowsalya committed suicide by hanging. P.W.1 and P.W.2 are the maternal uncle and mother of the deceased Kowsalya respectively. As per the evidence of P.W.1, the appellant/accused demanded Rs.20,000/- from P.W.2 for buying motorcycle soon before the death of Kowsalya. Whereas P.W.2 in her evidence deposed that the accused demanded Rs.4,000/- to put up a flower garden. So there is contradiction between the evidence of P.W.1 and P.W.2 in respect of demand of dowry. Even though the appellant/accused was convicted for offences under Sections 498A, 306 and 304B IPC, learned Government Advocate (Crl.side) fairly conceded that ingredients of Section 304(B) IPC have not been made out, hence the appellant/accused cannot be convicted for offence under Section 304(B) IPC, even though the death of Kowsalya is within seven years from the date of her marriage.

8.As per the evidence of P.W.7/Dr.Gopinath, he conducted autopsy on the body of deceased Kowsalya and gave Ex.P4 post-mortem certificate, opined that her death is due to asphyxia by hanging and it is unnatural. Furthermore, as per Ex.P5/inquest report, the death of Kowsalya is not due to demand of dowry. Even though death of Kowsalya is unnatural and not homicidal that too within seven years from the date of her marriage, there is no evidence to show that her death is due to demand of dowry soon before her death. In such circumstances, I am of the view, the conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court under Section 304(B) IPC is hereby set aside and the appellant/accused is acquitted from the charges under Section 304(B) IPC.

9.Now this Court has to decide whether the deceased Kowsalya was subjected to cruelty in the hands of the appellant/accused and whether the ingredients of Section 498A IPC have been made out? It is appropriate to extract Section 498A IPC, which reads as follows:

498A-Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty_Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.
Explanation-For the purpose of this section, ""cruelty"" means-
(a) Any willful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or
(b) Harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her meet such demand.]
10.Now the point to be decided is that whether the deceased Kowsalya was subjected to cruelty? It is appropriate to consider the evidence of P.W.3 and P.W.4/the star witnesses, who are neighbours of deceased Kowsalya. P.W.3/Karpagam in her evidence stated that on the fateful day (i.e.) on 11.04.2001, at about 2.00 p.m., the deceased Kowsalya came to her house and told that her husband had snatched her thali. P.W.3 on seeing Kowsalya without thali, tied yellow thread on her neck. At that time, P.W.4/Santhi was also there. Then P.W.3 and P.W.4 went to the accused house along with Kowsalya and questioned the same. The accused told them that the deceased Kowsalya herself handed over thali to the accused and then he had thrown the thali on the road. P.W.3 had taken that thali and handed over to Kowsalya to verify the same. At that time, Kowsalya told that < sovereign gold coin was missing and when Kowsalya told the accused that he himself snatched the thali, the accused left the place. The evidence of P.W.3 was corroborated by the evidence of P.W.4.

11.As per the dictum of the Apex Court in (2013) 2 SCC (Cri) 364 (State of Rajasthan v. Babu Meena), there are three types of witnesses, first one is wholly reliable; second one is partly reliable; another one is wholly unreliable. In case of wholly reliable testimony of a single witness, the conviction can be given without corroboration. This principle applies with greater vigour in case the nature of offence is such that it is committed in seclusion. If the evidence is partly reliable, corroboration is necessary.

12.On considering the evidence of P.W.3/Karpagam and P.W.4/Santhi, there is no reason to discard their evidence and the evidence of P.W.3 is also corroborated by the evidence of P.W.4. Therefore, I am of the view, the evidence of P.W.3 and P.W.4 are trustworthy and hence, it is reliable. Their evidence has clearly proved that on the date of occurrence, the deceased Kowsalya was subjected to cruelty in the hands of her husband/accused by snatching thali and thereby the accused caused her mental cruelty. So the trial Court has rightly convicted the appellant/accused for offence under Section 498A IPC. Hence, I do not find any reasons to interfere with the findings of the trial Court in respect of conviction under Section 498A IPC and hence, the conviction passed by the trial Court is hereby confirmed.

13.Now this Court has to decide whether the appellant/accused has abetted the deceased Kowsalya for commission of suicide? As per the evidence of P.W.3, she intimated the fact to one Kanniyappan, who instructed her to bring the deceased Kowsalya to police station. So P.W.3 and P.W.4 had gone to the house of Kowsalya, at that time, her house was locked inside, then they broke open the door and witnessed that Kowsalya was hanging. From the evidence of P.W.3 and P.W.4, it is seen that they have not stated anything about the abatement of suicide.

14.It is appropriate to consider Section 107 IPC, which reads as follows:

""107.Abetment of a thing.__ A person abets the doing of a thing, who__ First.__Instigates any person to do that thing; or Secondly.__Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing, or Thirdly.___Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.
Explanation 1.___ A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing.
Explanation 2.___Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of the act, and thereby facilitate the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.
15.In the first ingredient, it was stated that instigates any person to do that thing. In the case on hand, no instigation was found. As soon as P.W.3 went to the accused house, the accused told that the deceased Kowsalya herself has handed over her thali and when the same was questioned by P.W.3, he had thrown thali on the road and left the place and on verifying that thali, it was found that < sovereign gold coin was missing. So there is no evidence to show that the accused had instigated his wife Kowsalya for commission of suicide. Therefore, the first and second ingredients of Section 107 IPC are not made out.

16.Now this Court has to decide whether third ingredient intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing have been made out? According to the learned Government Advocate (Crl.side), the accused after consuming alcohol had snatched thali from his wife/Kowsalya, unable to bear the same, she was forced to commit suicide by the act of the accused. So the offence under Section 306 IPC is made out and the trial Court has rightly convicted the accused for offence under Section 306 IPC.

17.As already stated that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt. At this juncture, learned counsel for the appellant/accused submits that except the evidence of P.W.1 and P.W.2, there is no evidence to show that the accused is in the habit of consuming alcohol. On perusing the evidence of P.W.3 and P.W.4, they have not stated that the accused is in the habit of consuming alcohol. In such circumstances, the arguments advanced by the learned Government Advocate (Crl.side) that the appellant had snatched the thali for consuming alcohol does not merit acceptance. So the prosecution has not proved that the appellant herein has aided or instigated his wife/deceased Kowsalya to commit suicide. Because as soon as the appellant had snatched the thali, Kowsalya had intimated the same to P.W.3 and P.W.4, thereafter, P.W.3 and P.W.4 along with Kowsalya had gone to the house of the appellant and questioned about the act of accused, at that time, the appellant proclaimed that the deceased Kowsalya herself handed over her thali. Then, the appellant had thorwn the thali on the road, which was taken by P.W.3 and handed over to deceased, on verification, they found that < sovereign gold coin was missing. Then the deceased told her husband that he would only snatch the same, but the accused left the place. So the ingredients of Section 107 IPC have not been made out. In my view, the trial Court cannot convict the accused for offence under Section 306 IPC on presumption that as if the accused snatched the thali for consuming alcohol and made her cruelty, hence she was forced to commit suicide. Therefore, the conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court under Section 306 IPC is hereby set aside and the appellant/accused is acquitted from the charges under Section 306 IPC.

18.As already stated supra, the appellant/accused is convicted for offence under Section 498A IPC? At this juncture, learned counsel for the appellant/accused submits that the appellant/accused was already in prison for two years and now he is ready to compensate P.W.2/mother of the deceased Kowsalya and hence, some leniency may be shown in respect of quantum of sentence.

19.On considering the above submission, I am inclined to reduce the quantum of sentence imposed by the trial Court. The trial Court has sentenced the accused to undergo three years rigorous imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- in default in payment to undergo six months simple imprisonment. Now the sentence is reduced from three years to two years and the fine amount is increased from Rs.5,000/- to Rs.30,000/- in default in payment to undergo one month rigorous imprisonment. The fine amount is Rs.30,000/-, out of which, Rs.25,000/- is ordered to be paid as compensation to P.W.2/Nirmala, mother of the deceased Kowsalya.

20.In fine, The Criminal Appeal is partly allowed.

The conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court for offences under Sections 304(B) and 306 IPC are hereby set aside. The appellant/accused is acquitted from the charges levelled against him.

The conviction passed by the trial Court for offence under Section 498A IPC is hereby confirmed and the sentence is modified as follows:

The sentence is reduced from three years to two years and the fine amount is increased from Rs.5,000/- to Rs.30,000/- in default in payment to undergo one month rigorous imprisonment. The fine amount is Rs.30,000/-, out of which, Rs.25,000/- is ordered to be paid as compensation to P.W.2/Nirmala, mother of the deceased Kowsalya.
Bail bond executed by the appellant/accused if any shall stand cancelled.
The trial Court is directed to take effective steps to secure the appellant/accused to undergo the period of sentence as imposed by this Court (i.e.) two years, if the appellant/accused has not undergone the period.
Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed.

                                        CRL.P No. 103410 of 2022




                           ORAL ORDER
1. The petitioners who are facing charges for the offences punishable under Sections 498A and 306 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code (for short, 'the IPC') are before this Court.

2. The case of the prosecution is that accused No.1 is the husband of deceased-Shweta and other accused are the family members of the accused No.1. On 07.12.2020 at about 8.00 a.m. deceased-Shweta took the son of accused No.4 to the terrace of the house to play, the son of the accused No.4 fell down from the terrace and at that time, all the accused came to the spot and abused deceased-Shweta and also asked her to 'Go and Die'. However, it is alleged that unable to bear the harassment, deceased-Shweta hanged herself to death. It is further alleged that the accused used to subject the deceased-Shweta to cruelty both mentally and physically.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted the utterance of the word 'Go and Die' in the bit of anger, does not satisfy the essential element to constitute an offence under Section 306 of the IPC. He further submitted that there is no specific overtact as against each of the accused as to how and in what manner subjected the deceased-Shweta to cruelty both mentally and physically so as to constitute an offence under Section 498A of the IPC.

NC: 2025:KHC-D:286

4. Learned counsel for the petitioners has placed reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in case of Sanju Alias Sanjay Singh Sengar Vs. State of M.P (Sanju Alias Sanjay Singh Sengar).1

5. In response learned Additional Government Advocate (AGA) for the respondent No.1-State and learned counsel for respondent No.2 argued that the deceased-Shweta hang herself to death unable to bear the harassment meted out by the accused and also due to abetment by accused and therefore, the veracity of the allegation can be gone into at the time of trial and not at this stage and therefore, sought for dismissal of the petition.

6. After considering the arguments of learned counsel for the parties, the following are noted:

7. The marriage of the deceased-Shweta was solemnized on 13.05.2013 from the date of marriage till her death, there is no allegation against these petitioners subjected deceased-Shweta to cruelty both mentally and physically and continuously, so as to constitute an offence punishable under Section 498A of the IPC. Even accepting that the accused uttered the words 'Go and Die' is under the spur of movement, when the son of the accused No.4 fell down from the terrace who was taken to the terrace by deceased- Shweta. The utterance of the words whether, 'Go and Die' constitute an offence under Section 306 of the IPC was examined (2002) 5 SCC 371 NC: 2025:KHC-D:286 and point for consideration before Apex Court in the case of Sanju Alias Sanjay Singh Sengar, wherein, with reference to the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Swamy Prahaladdas Vs. State of M.P2 (Swamy Prahaladdas), it was held that mere the word uttered by the accused to deceased-Shweta to 'Go and Die' is not yet prima facie enough to instigate the deceased to commit suicide.

8. Hon'ble Apex Court in the catina of decision has held that to constitute an offence under Section 306 of the IPC, the following essential elements must be satisfied:

a. There must be an intention on the part of the accused to aid or instigate or abet the deceased to commit suicide.
b. There must be suicide and death and abetment thereof.
c. There must be a continuous harassment meted out by the accused before the death.
d. Such irritation and annoying must be proximity to the time of occurrence of the death.
9. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Geo Varghese Vs. State of Rajasthan and Another (Geo Varghese)3 at para 22 held as under:

1995 Supp(3) SCC 438 2021 SCC online SC 873 NC: 2025:KHC-D:286
22. What is required to constitute an alleged abetment of suicide under Section 306IPC is there must be an allegation of either direct or indirect act of incitement to the commission of offence of suicide and mere allegations of harassment of the deceased by another person would not be sufficient in itself, unless, there are allegations of such actions on the part of the accused which compelled the commission of suicide. Further, if the person committing suicide is hypersensitive and the allegations attributed to the accused are otherwise not ordinarily expected to induce a similarly situated person to take the extreme step of committing suicide, it would be unsafe to hold the accused guilty of abetment of suicide. Thus, what is required is an examination of every case on its own facts and circumstances and keeping in consideration the surrounding circumstances as well, which may have bearing on the alleged action of the accused and the psyche of the deceased.
10. In the instant case, it is alleged that the accused uttered the words 'Go and Die' to the deceased when the son of the accused No.4 fell from the terrace in the presence of deceased and therefore, the same does not satisfy the essential element to constitute an offence under Section 306 of the IPC.

11. In view of the above, continuation of the criminal proceedings will be an abuse of the process of law. Accordingly, I pass the following:

ORDER
i) The petition is allowed.
NC: 2025:KHC-D:286

ii) The impugned proceedings in SC No.51/2021 pending on the file of the learned Principal District and Sessions Judge, Gadag, insofar as it relates to the petitioners - accused stands quashed.

ORDER
The petitioners who are the accused in C.C.No.53 of 2013 on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate No.I, Dharmapuri, have come forward with this petition to quash the proceedings initiated against them for the offences punishable under Sections 498(A) and 494 IPC.

2. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the first petitioner is a husband, petitioners 2 and 3 are the father-in-law and mother-in-law, petitioners 5 and 6 are the sister-in-laws of the defacto complainant/second respondent. The marriage between the first petitioner and the defacto complainant was performed on 23.06.2008 and the second respondent has been living separately in her parental home from 26.08.2009. It is further submitted that the first petitioner/husband has filed a petition under Section 13(1)(i) of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 in H.M.O.P.No.75 of 2012 before the Sub Court, Dharmapuri, for divorce on 19.03.2012. Thereafter, the second respondent has given a complaint on 08.02.2013 before the respondent police, which is only a counter blast for filing of divorce petition. It is also submitted that the ingredients of Sections 498(A) and 494 IPC are not made out against the petitioners. To substantiate the same, the learned counsel for the petitioners relied upon the Judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in (i) (2012) 10 Supreme Court Cases 741 ( Geeta Mehrotra And Another vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another and (ii) (2010)7 Supreme Court Cases 667 (Preeti Gupta and Another vs. State of Jharkhand And Another. Hence, he prays for quashing the proceedings.

3. Resisting the same, the learned counsel for the second respondent/defacto complainant/wife would submit that the averments made in the FIR, Section 161 Cr.P.C. statement and further statement clearly proves that the offences prima facie made out against the petitioners. He would also submit that explanation (a) in Section 498A IPC is squarely applicable to the facts of the present case and that there is no necessity for causing any injury or forcing the defacto complainant to commit suicide, mere mental agony is sufficient. He would further submit that the first petitioner/husband has filed HMOP.No.75 of 2012 for divorce before the Sub Court, Dharmapuri and the same was dismissed on 11.04.2014. It is to be noted that the first petitioner has married another woman, who has been arrayed as A6 and the petitioners 2 to 5 have arranged the second marriage, which amounts to cruelty. Hence he prays for dismissal of this petition.

4.Learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the first respondent police has adopted the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the second respondent.

5.Considered the rival submission made by both sides and perused the typed set of papers.

6.A perusal of the typed set of papers reveals that the marriage between the first petitioner and the defacto complainant was solemnised on 23.06.2008, but they have been living separately from 26.08.2009. The first petitioner/husband has filed a petition under Section 13(1)(i) of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 in H.M.O.P.No.75 of 2012 dated 19.03.2012 before the Sub Court, Dharmapuri for divorce. The first petitioner has also got second marriage. It further reveals that the second respondent has given a complaint before the respondent police on 08.02.2013. On that basis, a case has been registered in Crime No.9 of 2013 for the offences under Sections 498A and 494 IPC. After investigation, a charge sheet has been filed and the same was taken on file in C.C.No.53 of 2013 on the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate No.I, Dharmapuri.

7.Now the point to be decided is that whether the ingredients of Section 498(A) IPC prima facie made out against the petitioners? So it is appropriate to incorporate Section 498A IPC, which runs as follows:

498A-Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty_Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.
Explanation-For the purpose of this section, ""cruelty"" means-
(a) Any willful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or
(b) Harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her meet such demand. Cruelty has been explained in Explanation (a) and (b). As per explanation (a), it is not necessary to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; It means mental agony also amounts to cruelty.
8.A perusal of Section 161 Cr.P.C. Statement of the defacto complainant reveals that the first petitioner/husband has assaulted her then and there, since she has not given birth to a child. It further reveals that her in-laws have also been scolded her then and there by abusing her that she has not given birth to a child. Further, they scolded her to hand over the thali kodi and asked her to go to her parental home. It clearly shows that the second respondent had met out cruelty at the hands of her husband and in-laws. Further it was stated in Section 161 Cr.P.C. statement, the first petitioner has got second marriage, which has been performed by her in-laws/petitioners 2 to 5. The performance of second marriage itself caused mental agony to the defacto complainant. Under such circumstances, the argument advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the ingredients of Section 498A IPC have not been made out against the petitioners, does not merit acceptance.

9. Now this Court has to consider the decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioners reported in 2010 7 Supreme Court Cases 667 (Preeti Gupta and Another vs. State of Jharkhand And Another and submits that if there is any dispute between the spouses, the wife always roped the in-laws and daughter-in-laws in the complaint and hence, they should be exonerated from the criminal liability. For the reason, he relied upon para-33 to 37, which are extracted hereunder:

33.The learned members of the Bar have enormous social responsibility and obligation to ensure that the social fibre of family life is not ruined or demolished. They must ensure that exaggerated versions of small incidents should not be reflected in the criminal complaints. Majority of the complaints are filed either on their advice or with their concurrence. The learned members of the Bar who belong to a noble profession must maintain its noble traditions and should treat every complaint under section 498-A as a basic human problem and must make serious endeavour to help the parties in arriving at an amicable resolution of that human problem. They must discharge their duties to the best of their abilities to ensure that social fibre, peace and tranquillity of the society remains intact. The members of the Bar should also ensure that one complaint should not lead to multiple cases.
34. Unfortunately, at the time of filing of the complaint the implications and consequences are not properly visualized by the complainant that such complaint can lead to insurmountable harassment, agony and pain to the complainant, accused and his close relations.
35. The ultimate object of justice is to find out the truth and punish the guilty and protect the innocent. To find out the truth is a herculean task in majority of these complaints. The tendency of implicating the husband and all his immediate relations is also not uncommon. At times, even after the conclusion of criminal trial, it is difficult to ascertain the real truth. The courts have to be extremely careful and cautious in dealing with these complaints and must take pragmatic realities into consideration while dealing with matrimonial cases. The allegations of harassment of husband's close relations who had been living in different cities and never visited or rarely visited the place where the complainant resided would have an entirely different complexion. The allegations of the complaint are required to be scrutinized with great care and circumspection.
36.Experience reveals that long and protracted criminal trials lead to rancour, acrimony and bitterness in the relationship amongst the parties. It is also a matter of common knowledge that in cases filed by the complainant if the husband or the husband's relations had to remain in jail even for a few days, it would ruin the chances of amicable settlement altogether. The process of suffering is extremely long and painful.
37. Before parting with this case, we would like to observe that a serious relook of the entire provision is warranted by the legislation. It is also a matter of common knowledge that exaggerated versions of the incident are reflected in a large number of complaints. The tendency of over implication is also reflected in a very large number of cases. The criminal trials lead to immense sufferings for all concerned. Even ultimate acquittal in the trial may also not be able to wipe out the deep scars of suffering of ignominy. Unfortunately a large number of these complaints have not only flooded the courts but also have led to enormous social unrest affecting peace, harmony and happiness of the society. It is high time that the legislature must take into consideration the pragmatic realities and make suitable changes in the existing law. It is imperative for the legislature to take into consideration the informed public opinion and the pragmatic realities in consideration and make necessary changes in the relevant provisions of law.
10.In (2012) 10 Supreme Court Cases 741 ( Geeta Mehrotra And Another vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another), wherein it was held that while giving complaint for the offences under Section 498A IPC and Section 3/4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, sister and brother in-laws of the complainant were included casually. So it cannot be overlooked that it would be total abuse of the process of law. Further, it was held that it would be clear abuse of the legal and judicial process to mechanically send the named accused in the F.I.R. to undergo the trial, unless the F.I.R. discloses specific allegation, which would persuade the Court to take cognizance of the offence alleged against the relatives of the main accused, who are prima facie not found to have indulged in physical and mental torture of the complainant/wife. In the case on hand, a specific averment made that petitioners 2 to 5 had conducted the second marriage of the first petitioner, which caused mental agony to the second respondent.

11.Considering the aforestated facts and circumstances of the case, I am of the view, there is a prima facie material to frame charges against the petitioners for the offences punishable under Sections 498(A) and 494 IPC. Therefore, I do not find any reasons to quash the proceedings initiated against the petitioners. Accordingly, the Criminal Original Petition stands dismissed as devoid of merits. The trial Court, uninfluenced by any of the observations made by this Court in this order, shall dispose of the matter on merits and in accordance with law. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petitions are closed.

     This chargesheet is submitted by the PSI of
Kodigehalli Police Station against the accused for the
offence punishable u/s 498A of I.P.C.


     2.   The case of the prosecution is that the

accused married CW.1 on 07.05.2017 and residing

with accused at house No.335, 7th cross, Bhadrappa

Layout, situated within the jurisdiction of Kodigehalli

Police Station and picked up quarrel with CW.1

unnecessarily, tortured physically and mentally and

thereby   the accused has       committed the offence

punishable u/s 498A of I.P.C.
                          3                  C.C.16745/2019




         3. The accused is on bail. As required u/sec. 207

of Cr.PC, the copies of the charge sheet papers were

furnished to the accused. Charge was framed for the

offence punishable U/s 498A of I.P.C. and read over

and explained to the accused in the language known to

him. Accused has not pleaded guilty and claimed for

trial.


         4.   In order to prove the case of the prosecution,

the prosecution has examined Pw.1 and got marked

Ex.P.1. On closure of the evidence on the side of the

prosecution, the statement of the accused u/sec. 313

Cr.PC came to be recorded, the accused has denied the

incriminating evidence appearing against him and not

chosen to lead defence evidence.



         5.    Heard    the   arguments.     Perused         the

documents placed on record.
                        4                  C.C.16745/2019




     6.     The points that arise for consideration are :

          1. Whether the prosecution has proved
          beyond all reasonable doubt that
          accused has committed the offence U/s
          498A of I.P.C.?

          2. What order ?

    7. The above points are answered as under :
     Point No.1: In the Negative.
     Point No.2: As per final order for the following :
                       REASONS


     8. Point No.1 : The accused has picked up quarrel

with his wife CW.1 unnecessarily and tortured her

physically and mentally without reason and thereby

the accused has committed the offence punishable u/s

498A of I.P.C.

     9. The Ld. Sr.APP for the state during the course

of argument has submitted that prosecution has

examined mahazar witness as PW.1, the evidence

placed     by   prosecution   witness   and   documentary

evidence are clearly establishes that the accused has

committed the offense as alleged in the charge sheet.
                      5                C.C.16745/2019




Therefore, prays to convict the accused by imposing

maximum sentence.

     10. Per contra, the learned counsel appearing for

accused during the course of argument has submitted

that though the prosecution has examined mahazar

witness, material witness complainant and other

witnesses did not turn up to adduce evidence, in the

absance of such material evidence of complainant and

eye witnesses, evidence placed by the prosecution is

not sufficient to come to conclusion that the accused

has committed offense as alleged in the charge sheet.

Therefore, the accused is entitled to benefit of doubt

and prays for acquit the accused.

     11. In the light of the submission made above,

on careful perusal of oral and documentary evidence

placed by the prosecution, no doubt, the complainant

did not turn up to adduce evidence as despite issued

warrant and proclamation repeatedly, the prosecution

has not secured the presence of complainant and
                      6                   C.C.16745/2019




hence complainant has been dropped. Further, PW.1 is

mahazar witness, during the evidence he deposed

about mahazar drawn by police as Ex.P.1, except

evidence of mahazar witness, nothing is on record. So,

absolutely there is no evidence of material witnesses,

in the absence of such evidence of material witnesses,

evidence of mahazar witness is of no use to prove the

guilt of accused and the accused cannot held to be

guilty of the alleged offence. Therefore, the prosecution

has failed to prove guilt of accused beyond reasonable

doubt.

     12. Therefore, in view of discussion made above,

the considered opinion is of the court that, the

prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of the accused

beyond reasonable doubt. The accused is entitled to

benefit of doubt. Hence, answered the point No.1 in the

Negative.

     13. Point No.2: In view of discussion made on

point No.1 this court proceeds to pass following
                          7                    C.C.16745/2019




                             ORDER
Acting under section 248(1) of Cr.P.C the accused is acquitted of the offence punishable u/s 498A of I.P.C.

19. The learned counsel appearing for the compalinant has argued that........

20. Per contra, the learned counsel appearing for accused No.1 has argued that........................................................................... .............

It is further argued that, as per Ex.D.10 CW.1 has filed suit O S No.1245/2017 against accused No.1 seeking cancellation both sale deeds and made a Deed of Decleration as per Ex.D.12. Ex.P.26 Memo of Undertaking is the document said have been executed by the accused No.1 is false, that documents has been get registered by the accused No.1 forcibly by kdnapping, in this regard the accused No.1 lodged complainat before police as crime No.121.2011. If really CW.1 get executed the MOU by the accused, there was no necessity to file a suit O S No.1245/2017 as per Ex.D.10 against accused No.1 seeking cancellation both sale deeds and made a Deed of Decleration as per Ex.D.12. Moreover MOU is not discussed in the said suits. The documents palced by the accused No.1 regarding purchase of properties would shows that he had sufficient fund to purchase properties of CW.1 under Ex.P.2 and Ex.P.6 and more over sub registrar clearly deposed that after consent of CW.1 proceeded to register the documents. Further, regarding seizer of documents by PW.19 under seizer mahazar it is argued that PW.15 and 15 are deposed in support of prosecution case, the version stated in their cross examination is contridictory to each other and not corroberated with evidence of PW.19 and evidence of these witnesses will not help the prosecution case.

21. Upon careful perusal of material on record in the light of submission made by the learned counsel for the parties reveals that admittedly, ...............................

22. The complainant executed Ex.P.2 sale deed in respect south street property to accused No.1 on 07.03.2011, after that on 02.04.2011 she executed another sale deed Ex.P.6 in respect of central street property, beleiving the words accused No.1 that he will obtain loan from bank and give money, the gap between two sale deed is nearly one month. At this stage it would be petinent to mention here that if a common man is need of money urgently and for that he executed document, his immeidate response would be ask money from whos favour to document is executed. In this case, no material on record to show that the complaiant neither approached accused No.1 seeking money immediately after execution of first sale deed nor even after execution of second sale deed. Further, second sale deed was executed on 02.04.2011 and the date of complaint lodged by the complainant is 25.07.2012 and complaint is registered on 31.07.2012,, so after lapse of one year complaint is filed and moreoever as deposed by the CW.1 she lodged complaint only when she was instructed by the Assistant Cmmissioner of Police to come to Police station and lodge compalint not valuntarily. It makes clear from the evidence of CW.1 lodged complaint as per the instruction of Assistant Commissioner of Police. Beside, no explaination for inordinate delay of more than one year by the prosecution.

Further, admittedly Ex.P.1 complaint is in the langauge of english written by the complainant, the evidence of CW.1 has been recorded through the translater translating from english to Kannada, so she is very well in english. In the cross examination she deposed that she did not read the contents of Ex.P.26 sale deed since it was in english langaue. Therefore, in view of discussion above the evidence of CW.1 is doubtfull.

The evidence of PW.3 to 5, PW.8 to 11 and 16 is related to transaction held by them with accused No.1, such transactions are appears to be civil in nature and not related to the facts of this case, in the absance of reliable and cogent evidence to show that said witnesses have been cheated by accused arguemnt of learned counsel for the complainant that said witnesses are cheated from the hands of accused No.1 and his conduct shows he is habitual offence in the same nature of offence of this case cannot be acceptable, it is therefore, evidence of these witnesses will not help the prosecution case to prove nexus between transaction held between accused and complainant.

The evidence of PW.15 and 18 relates to Ex.P.5 siezer mahazar in their presence of PW.19 seized 32 documents from the house of accused No.1, evidence of these witnesses is contridictory to each other and not corraberate with evidence of IO as argued by the learned counsel for the accused No.1.

The evidence of PW.12, PW.14 pertaining to registration of case as per Ex.P.4 FIR by receiving the Ex.P.1 complaint from CW.1 and deputed to serve the notice to witnesses, in turn reported it PW.19, does not help to prove the offence levelled against accused. The evidence of PW.19 I O pertaining to investigation of the case submitted charge sheet. The documents seized from the house of accused during investigation are related to transaction held with accused No.1 by the names whome referred in the said documets and said transaction are appears to be civil in nature. The properties are situated at Neelasandra within the jurisdiction of Vivek Nagar Police Station and crime is registered at Hebbal Police Station, it is not the case of prosecution that tarnsaction held within the limit of Hebbal Police Station and no explaination by the IO in this regard, which creates doubt.

So far accused No.2 is concern except evidence on record that documents were in her house, nothing on record to show invlovement of accused No.2. The Memo Of Undertaking is executed by accused No.1 to the complainant in respect of two house porperties along with other properties on 15.09.2012. The accused No.1 lodged complaint before Hebbal Police on 01.05.2012 alleging that complainant and her family member are threatened his life by saying that they will kidnap him, which is registered as per Ex.D.11 FIR. Thus it is clear from the said documents that complaint is lodged before 4 to 5 months early to execute MOU assuming his kidnap, the version of the accused No.1 relying on said evidence that he was kidnapped and get executed MOU is not beleivable.

JUDGMENT
Accused are the appellants in this appeal. The appellants have come forward with this appeal challenging the judgment dated 30.06.2003 by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court No.III, Vridhachalam made in S.C.No.185 of 1997 convicting the appellants for the offence under section 498A IPC sentencing to undergo simple imprisonment of two years each and to pay a fine of Rs.1000/- each in default to undergo three months simple imprisonment and convicting the appellants for the offence under section 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act sentencing to undergo simple imprisonment for six months and to pay a fine of Rs.500/- each in default to undergo simple imprisonment for two months. The sentence was also suspended and the appellants were released on bail, pending disposal of the appeal, on executing a bond for a sum of Rs.5,000/- with two sureties for a like sum to the satisfaction of the learned District Munsif cum Judicial Magistrate, Titagudi.

2. The following is the brief account of the prosecution case :-

2[a] The deceased Shanthi is the wife of A.1. A.2 is his mother. The marriage of the deceased with A.1 was celebrated in the year 1987. On 11.06.1992, the deceased consumed insecticide and committed suicide. On getting the intimation, the Village Administrative Officer, PW1 lodged Ex.P1 complaint with the police stating that he inspected the place and hence he lodged the complaint. On receipt of the complaint, PW14, Sub-Inspector of Police registered the case u/s 174 Cr.P.C. and lodged FIR, Ex.P7. Since the deceased died before seven years from the date of marriage, he sent the FIR to the RDO and Court. PW13, RDO conducted inquest over the dead body of the deceased and prepared Ex.P6, inquest report in which he has stated that there could not be any dowry demand and the death did not occur due to the dowry demand but it might be a murder. Even though the statement of witnesses were recorded by DSP and investigation was conducted by him, he was not examined as witness.
2[b] PW7, the lady doctor attached to Titakudi Government Hospital conducted autopsy over the dead body of the deceased and issued Ex.P3, Post mortem certificate. Exs.P4 & P5 are the reports obtained from toxicology division after the examination of the internal organs of the deceased in which it is stated that the internal organs found to have contained Monocrotophos which is a poisonous organophosphorous insecticide. On perusal of Ex.P4, the doctor gave final opinion that the deceased died due to the intake of insecticidal poison.
3. After the prosecution evidence was over, the trial court questioned the appellants/accused u/s.313 Cr.P.C. as regards incriminating materials available against them in the prosecution evidence. They denied the complicity to the offence. They did not examine any witnesses nor had they marked any documents.

4. After analysing the evidence and materials on record, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court No.III, Chennai Vridhachalam sentenced the appellants as stated above. Challenging the judgment of conviction, the appellants are before this Court.

5. The point for consideration is, ""whether the prosecution has established the charges framed against the appellants/accused beyond all reasonable doubt?"".

Point:-

5[a] Even though the charges were framed against both the appellants under Section 498A IPC, Section 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act and Section 304(b) IPC, they were acquitted of the charges under section 304(b) IPC. Hence, the Court has to see whether there was dowry demand on the part of the appellants.
5[b] The learned counsel for the appellants Mr.Ilantheraiyan would contend that the evidence of PWs3 and 4 contained statements which are not stated by them in the 161 statements and that in this case the investigation officer has not been examined and the valuable right of the accused have been defeated by non-examination of the investigation officer since vital contractions found available between the evidence of PWs3 and 4 with 161 statements which could not be elicited to the investigation officer, that the RDO report does not contain the opinion that there was a dowry demand on the part of the appellants and that the investigation including the arrest of the accused has not been established before the Court and hence the appellants are entitled for the benefit of doubt.
6. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor submits that the evidence of prosecution witnesses are convincing and hence there is nothing wrong on the part of the Court below for finding both the appellants guilty under Section 498A IPC and Section 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act.

7. To begin with, it is profitable to discuss about the opinion rendered by the RDO after examination of the witnesses in the scene of crime immediately after the occurrence. Before PW13, RDO, none of the witnesses have spoken about the demand of dowry. Even though he says in his evidence that the witnesses were examined by him openly, he has mentioned in his report that he conducted a discrete enquiry. The RDO is not authenticated to conduct any discreet enquiry. In his inquest report, Ex.P6, he has recorded his opinion that he came to know from the discreet enquiry of the public that it is a pre-planned murder and there was no dowry torture and hence this may be treated as murder case and further investigation may be proceeded on this basis. However, in what manner this opinion was considered by the Investigating Officer is not known to the Court because the investigation officer was not brought to the witness box. It is incumbent upon the RDO to submit a separate report as regards his enquiry of the individuals concerned with reference to the crime and submit the same to the officials prescribed with his final conclusion. But he has combined the enquiry report and the inquest report and in the inquest report itself he has recorded his findings. Even then, from his report it transpires that there was no dowry torture on the part of the appellants.

8. Coming to the evidence of Pws 3 and 4 who are the the mother and brother of the deceased, this Court is able to find remarkable inconsistencies in their evidence when considered with the statements available in 161 statements. PW3 has stated that after the birth of two female children to the deceased, she used to come to their house frequently after quarrel with her husband. Further, she also says that both the accused harassed her demanding further five sovereigns of jewels. PW4 has stated that the first accused was having illegal contact with one lady in Maaligaikottam village and he used to tell the deceased that only if she brought five sovereigns of jewels from her parents house, she can live with him otherwise she would have to live in the house of her parents and that he also told that he would marry the said lady and hence due to both the aspects, his sister committed suicide. But the above said allegations were not stated by him before the police. Even this was not disclosed by PW3, his mother.

9. PW6, is the cousin brother of the deceased. He says that the deceased used to inform him that the first accused was torturing her by demanding more money to run a finance company and hence forced her to bring her share in the family properties and she had also told him that he might get money from her grandmother. But these things have not been stated by PWs3 and 4. They did not say that in order to run a finance company, the first appellant was harassing the deceased to get money from her parents. The other witnesses to say about the dowry harassment turned hostile to the prosecution and they were examined in cross.

10. In this case, the evidence of PWs3 and 4 do not inspire confidence of the Court. There is no ground available to believe them. They are contradictory to each other and they are also not in consonance with the statements available in their 161 statements. Top of all, the investigation officer has not been examined to speak about the course of investigation, arrest of the accused and the examination of the witnesses which have not been established before this Court and it is a vacuum caused in this case by the prosecution.

11. In the above said circumstances, this Court is of the view that the charges under section 498A of IPC and Section 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act have not been established beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, the judgment of conviction and sentence passed by the Court below is not sustainable which is liable to be set aside and it is accordingly set aside. This point is answered in negative.

12. In the result, the Criminal Appeal is allowed acquitting the appellants of the charges framed against them under section 498 IPC and Section 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act. The bail bonds, if any, executed by the appellant s shall stand discharged and the fine amounts, if any, paid by the appellants shall be refunded to them.
